     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was tried and convicted of the murder of Rebecca Diab at Bass Hill on or about 18 February 2000. Although he pleaded not guilty to murder, the only issue at the trial was whether the appellant acted under provocation. 
     
      
    2 The appellant had previously been tried for the same offence in this Court before O’Keefe J and a jury. That trial commenced on 23 July 2001 and concluded on 10 August 2001 when the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder. 
     
      
    3 An appeal was lodged against that conviction which was upheld and a new trial ordered (R v Kalouf [2003] NSWCCA 179). 
     
      
    4 Following the appellant’s conviction upon the retrial he was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years commencing on 18 February 2000 and expiring on 17 February 2020 with a non-parole period of 13 ½ years expiring on 17 August 2013. 
     
      
    5 The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in law in his directions to the jury on the availability of the partial defence of provocation pursuant to s 23 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 in that: 
       
       
        
        (a) The jury were misdirected as to the matters they were entitled to consider under subs 2(b); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The jury were directed in a manner contrary to the terms of subs 3(a); and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Following (a) and (b) above, the jury should have been directed in the terms of subs 3(a) that the absence of reasonable proportionality between the provocative act of the deceased and the response of the accused person does not negative the availability of the partial defence of provocation. 
        
       
       
      2. His honour the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to consciousness of guilt of the appellant in that the jury was not directed as to the proper use they might make of the evidence of the appellant’s accounts, and any inconsistency therein. 
       
       
      The relevant facts 
       
      
    6 The deceased married Elie Diab in 1975 and they immigrated to Australia in 1983. For the 12 months prior to her death the deceased worked as a house carer about twice a week. Her employer was a Mrs Dalsanto and she also gave care to Mrs Dalsanto’s two children. About 6 or 7 months before her death the deceased had told her husband that she was now working for an elderly man by the name of Rupert who lived in the Chatswood area.  
     
      
    7 Evidence was given at the trial that from some months before her death the deceased had taken to ringing members of her family if she was not coming home that evening. On those occasions she would say that she would be minding children overnight because the family for which she was babysitting would be going out until quite late. 
     
      
    8 Lisa Dalsanto gave evidence that she initially employed the deceased in 1997 to clean her home and later as a babysitter for her daughter. She indicated that the deceased initially attended her home twice a week but this increased from 1999 when her second child was born. Mrs Dalsanto had become close to the deceased who had confided in her that her marriage was unhappy.  
     
      
    9 About 8 months before her death the deceased told Mrs Dalsanto that she was dating a Slavic bus driver called Franc. They would go to the Travelodge Motel at North Sydney together. The deceased also told Mrs Dalsanto that after Franc she started dating an Australian man and they used to stay at the Rydges Hotel at Cronulla. Some weeks before her death the deceased told Mrs Dalsanto that she was again dating Franc. 
     
      
    10 Mrs Dalsanto had spoken to the deceased about her unhappy marriage and suggested that she should get a divorce. However, the deceased said she would not do this because her husband would be very upset. 
     
      
    11 The appellant conducted a business as a tailor in a shop at Greenacre. He met the deceased when she was introduced to him as a prospective employee in his business. After a time the deceased and the appellant commenced an affair. 
     
      
    12 Apparently about 4 months before Rebecca Diab died the appellant moved to Melbourne and had requested that the deceased and her children come to live with him in that city. The deceased did not want to do this and she tried to withdraw from the relationship. Evidence was given at the trial by Mr John Stait who had given assistance to the deceased’s family that the deceased had come to him at his home before Christmas 1999 appearing to be agitated. She said she was frightened of a man who was making advances to her all the time and was pestering her with phone calls. She apparently indicated that she was scared for her life because she would not go with him. Mr Stait suggested to the deceased that she should obtain a restraining order but the deceased’s reply was along the lines of “what is the use, they always seem to get around it”. The deceased also allegedly said to Mr Stait that her boss said that he was going to kill her if he did not have his own way with her. 
     
      
    13 Mr Stait gave evidence that he went to the deceased’s home for dinner on 16 February 2000. After dinner, when her husband was out of the room, the deceased said to Mr Stait that she was really scared and that she did not know what was going to happen. 
     
      
    14 Evidence was also given of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased which included admissions made by the appellant under s 184(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 in the following terms: 
     
      
    ·  that the appellant and the deceased met at motels two or three times per month over a year before her death and gave the appearance of being a happy couple. 
     
      
    ·  that the appellant travelled by “Firefly Express” coach from Sydney to Melbourne and vice versa on numerous specified dates. 
     
      
    ·  that the appellant and deceased attended the Padstow RSL Club on specified dates. 
     
      
    ·  that shortly after 3 pm on Thursday 17 February 2000 the appellant purchased a knife from David Jones, which was used to fatally stab Rebecca Diab. 
     
      
    15 The deceased left her home on 17 February 2000 at about 8 am. She told her husband that was going to Rupert’s home. She rang her husband at about 2 pm and told him that she did not know what time she was coming home but that if she stayed at Rupert’s house she would ring him. 
     
      
    16 Evidence was given at the trial by Miss Clarke that on the night of 17 February 2000 she was working as a supervisor at the Padstow RSL. She stated that between the hours of 5 pm and 6.45 pm she was working in the poker machine area and saw a middle aged couple, (obviously the appellant and the deceased), sitting side-by-side playing the poker machines. 
     
      
    17 Natalie Malatta gave evidence that she checked the appellant and deceased into a room at the Rydge’s Hotel at Bass Hill around 7.20 pm. 
     
      
    18 Anita Mughelli gave evidence that she occupied Room 504 at the Rydges Hotel on the evening of 17 February 2000. At about 10.30 pm she was in bed watching television when she heard a raised woman’s voice coming from Room 506. She could not understand what was said. She also heard a few doors bang and a man’s voice. Both of these sounds appeared to come from Room 506. Miss Mughelli said the man and the woman were not screaming at each other but had raised voices. This went on for about 30 minutes and sounded like a domestic dispute. 
     
      
    19 At about 11 pm Miss Mughelli heard the sound of a shower from Room 506. The man and the woman were still yelling at each other and this continued until 11.30 pm. At about that time Miss Mughelli was planning to go and knock on their door if they did not stop yelling. At about 11.45 pm the voices stopped. Miss Mughelli fell asleep and was awoken at about 2.30 am on the following morning by a man’s voice from inside Room 506. The man was yelling but she could not hear what he was saying. Miss Mughelli heard the shower running in Room 506 again before she fell asleep and was later wakened by police knocking on the door of Room 506. 
     
      
    20 Mr Ahmed Khalouf, the son of the appellant, spoke with his father by mobile telephone at about 11 pm. At that stage his father indicated that he had no problems. However, the appellant called him at 2.35 am in the morning and had a conversation in Arabic which when translated was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Khalouf: What was the matter? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: I have committed a crime. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: What do you mean? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: I think I have killed her. I am trying to kill myself but I can’t. What am I going to do? 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: You have to turn yourself in and I will speak to Hassan. 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: Ok, call me back.” 
        
       
      
    21 In later conversation Mr Khalouf urged his father to let the police know and turn himself in. Mr Khalouf asked the appellant how he did it and the appellant told him that he had grabbed the knife off her, it hurt him and that she had fallen on it, but went on to say that there was no time to talk about it now. Mr Khalouf gave evidence of the following conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Khalouf: Are you sure she is dead? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: She’s been lying there for two hours. Can you give me to the morning, I just want to get some sleep before I hand myself in. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: Yeah, okay.” 
        
       
      
    22 After hanging up Mr Khalouf spoke with a relative and then called the police. He told the police that his father was at the Rydges Hotel at Bass Hill and that the police should check it as he did not believe his father. At about 3.25 am the appellant called back and according to Mr Khalouf the following conversation ensued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Appellant: Don’t wait until the morning, I think she may not be dead yet, call the police now. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: How do you know? 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: I think her heart is still beating. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: I will call them now. 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: Will you come with them. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: They will give you a call. 
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: OK, I am going to put some clothes on and I will wait for them. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: [What room are you in?}  
        
       
       
        
        Appellant: Room 506 on the fifth level. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Khalouf: Yes, I will call them.” 
        
       
      
    23 Mrs Assad, the appellant’s sister, at whose residence the appellant had been living in Melbourne gave evidence that the appellant left Melbourne in January 2000 to travel to Sydney by bus. Mrs Assad received a phone call from him on a day in February 2000 between 2.30 am and 3.30 am. The appellant said to her “I killed a woman.” She said to him “Which woman?” and he said “My wife.” She asked him “Why?” and he said, “They want me to”. He also said, “Ring your brother because he never answers me.” He said “They want me to do this, ring your brother and ask him what I shall do?” and she replied, “Do the best. You say that you did it. Call the police …” The appellant replied, “Ring your brother and tell him”. Mrs Assad said that when she spoke to her brother Hassan, she then became aware that the woman that had been killed was not the appellant’s wife, but Rebecca. The appellant’s voice sounded calm and normal when she spoke to him. 
     
      
    24 Mrs Assad stated that the appellant used to tell her that the deceased was very nice and that towards the end he would say that he wanted to marry her and bring her to Melbourne. She was not aware of any problems between them and he appeared to be always happy and laughing when he spoke to Rebecca on the telephone. 
     
      
    25 The police arrived at the motel at about 3.35 am. Evidence was given by Snr Const Miller that upon entering the motel room he observed the deceased covered by a doona. He asked the appellant “Who was she?” and the appellant replied “My girlfriend.” The appellant had a deep laceration on his left index finger. Snr Const Miller saw blood on the double bed, within the room and in the bathroom. 
     
      
    26 When questioned the appellant indicated that he had some difficulty in understanding English and that he spoke Arabic.  
     
      
    27 When the appellant was closely examined he was found to have a 1cm cut on the inside tip of his right index finger and a cut on his left index finger. He also had a small irregular blood stain on the inside of his right ear and a number of diluted blood stains on the outside of his right ear. There was a reddening on the upper and middle of his chest and blood spots and stains on various parts of his body. 
     
      
    28 When the deceased’s body was examined she was found to have a large amount of dried blood covering various parts of her body. There was a large open wound to the right side of her abdomen and the top of her right shoulder and two puncture marks on her upper chest. A plastic handled knife with the sheath removed with a bent tip and dried blood on both sides was also located. Blood was found on various parts of the floor and furniture within the room. 
     
      
    29 The police also located other items in the room including three Lebanese cucumbers and an unpeeled mango. A Lebanese cucumber and a seed of a mango were also found in the wastebin in the bathroom. The cucumber had matter resembling faeces on one end of it. 
     
      
    30 The appellant was interviewed at the scene by Det Sgt Anthony Karras. Det Karras said that the appellant appeared to understand what he was saying and replied in English. The appellant admitted stabbing the deceased but said this occurred after she had stabbed him. 
     
      
    31 During this interview the appellant told the police that when he tried to get the knife off the deceased she hit him on his left finger and that he did know what had happened. He then took the knife and found her on the floor. The appellant answered further questions about the deceased approaching him with the knife and admitting stabbing her after she hit him. The appellant said that he took the knife off her when she injured him, she fell onto him and he did not know what happened but he told himself that he killed her. 
     
      
    32 Dr Kevin Lee a forensic pathologist examined the body of the deceased in a post mortem examination. He found that the vast majority of the injuries on the body were sharp force types of injuries. There was a stab wound that passed through the right ear area measuring 3.8cm in length. There was an abrasion associated with this injury and a short skin flap. This meant that the injury had been produced by a sharp pointed and sharp edged instrument. Dr Lee followed the track of that wound and found that it had passed downwards and forwards at approximately 40 degrees and was approximately 8.1 cm in length. Dr Lee found a superficial abrasion on the right cheek of the deceased and another superficial abrasion to the right side of her neck. Dr Lee noted a 3 cm long, slightly irregular stab wound situated on the right side of the throat. Its track passed downwards medially and to the left. The doctor also found a V-shaped incised injury on the underside of the chin. Associated with that injury were a series of linear superficial cuts. The doctor also located two pinpointed abrasions underneath that injury. 
     
      
    33 Dr Lee noted a pair of stab wounds situated over the upper sternum of the deceased. One measured 1.9cm and was just to the right of the midline of the chest. Its track passed to the left side of the body at approximately 30 degrees. The second injury measured 1.2 cm by 0.5 cm wide, was 2.6 cm deep and was situated 2.1 cm to the right of the midline. Its track passed downwards and backwards at 10 degrees. 
     
      
    34 There was a further stab injury situated between the breasts just to the left midline of the chest. The entrance of the wound measured 1.2 cm with a 1.2 cm straight tail running to the left and it was 4.6 cm deep. There was a minor area of abrasion associated with it. The next injury the doctor examined was a stab wound to the right upper abdomen that was 5.5 cm long with a 2 cm vertical upward tail and 4 cm deep. It tracked through the skin, the abdominal cavity and the liver. 
     
      
    35 The doctor also found a wound to the side of the left of the neck which measured 3.5 cm long. The track passed directly transversely through the neck for a distance of 7.9 cm. There was another wound to that area which measured 4.5 cm and was behind and below the lower fixed point of the ear. The track of this injury passed downwards to the right and forwards at approximately 20 degrees. It was about 7 cm in length. This injury passed into the fourth cervical vertebra in the left side of the neck. 
     
      
    36 Dr Lee also noted damage to the deceased’s third, fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae in the centre of the neck. The third vertebra showed an irregular stab wound with a small loose wedge of bone, which was consistent with being caused by a sharp pointed knife. Dr Lee’s opinion was that it would require a significant amount of force to cut a piece of bone in the vertebra. He also described it as a heavy degree of force. 
     
      
    37 Dr Lee also noted a 4.7 cm wound to the right shoulder of the deceased and some other injuries. 
     
      
    38 During his examination Dr Lee observed seven injuries to the right hand. They were all cut injuries and ran crossways. Dr Lee also saw a series of ten incised wounds to the left hand. The doctor was of the opinion that these injuries were defence type injuries. The doctor also noted two curved bruises on the left upper arm that resembled injuries from light bite marks. 
     
      
    39 Dr Lee found a superficial V-shaped laceration just within the interior of the anus of the deceased. It would have been caused by a light or moderate degree of force and would be felt as at least uncomfortable and that some degree of pain would be quite reasonable. In Dr Lee’s opinion, a cucumber, like the one found in the bathroom of the hotel, would be quite capable of causing that type of injury. 
     
      
    40 Dr Lee was of the opinion that the deceased had died quickly and at most within 30 seconds and that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds that resulted in torrential external bleeding from the throat and neck area and non-supply of blood to the brain. Dr Lee’s opinion was that the deceased had initially been injured near the bed and when she became less mobile with the large volume of blood loss she bled onto the bed causing the heavy blood stains on the bed and then collapsed onto the floor. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    41 The appellant gave evidence that he had an intimate relationship with the deceased that commenced in 1998. He said that there were no problems in the relationship until 8 months prior to February 2000 when he decided that he wanted to stop it and return home. He said that he left Sydney and went to live in Melbourne so they could be apart. However, he travelled back to Sydney frequently to see his children and the deceased. He kept in constant communication with the deceased returning her daily calls. On the day before the incident, the deceased called him and said that she wanted to see the appellant on the Thursday for the last time before they each went back to their own homes. 
     
      
    42 They arranged to meet at the Padstow RSL at 5 pm and after drinking a few beers and playing on some poker machines they left the club at approximately 7 pm. The deceased was wearing a dress that the appellant had given to her some weeks previously. He had made the dress for her. They bought some fruit and vegetables and went back to the hotel. They went to the room, ate some fruit and then made love. They chatted together for a short while and again made love after which the appellant’s son rang him on his mobile phone. His son, Ahmed said, “I have been waiting for you, why haven’t you come, return home” to which the appellant responded “Tomorrow definitely I will be coming back.” The deceased had gone to the bathroom at that time. 
     
      
    43 When he had hung up the telephone the deceased said, “Every time I spend some … time with you together one of your children call us and disturb us.” She became edgy. He tried to talk to her gently and calmly. She wanted to make love again but he said that he was too tired. She started swearing at him telling him that his “mother is a slut. I am going to fuck your mother. All your children are sluts and hopeless.” 
     
      
    44 She left the bed, went to a table and picked up a cucumber which she inserted into her vagina and rectum. He asked her to remove the cucumber and when he pushed her the cucumber fell to the floor. She told him that she intended to use the cucumber on his daughter “because she has her birthday the following day. Because her husband cannot sleep with her and I want to use it on her. I want to use that cucumber on her because she is a slut.” 
     
      
    45 Mr Michael Moses who is an interpreter of the Arabic language was asked by counsel for the appellant about these words and the effect they would generally have on a Lebanese man. He said that the references to the mother would be the most humiliating of injuries. 
     
      
    46 The appellant gave evidence that when the cucumber fell to the floor and the appellant knelt down to pick it up the deceased hit him with her foot on his shoulder. He got up and asked her why she was hitting him to which she answered, “I want to kill you, you son of a bitch.” She grabbed the knife and attacked him and as he retreated he fell onto the bed she jumped on top of him saying that she wanted to kill him. He said that was the last thing he knew. 
     
      
    47 When the deceased had sworn at him and his family the appellant said that he felt very distressed, his “whole body was burning I couldn’t even take a breath, because I was so upset and insulted.” 
     
      
    48 When he came to the appellant said that he saw the deceased on the floor and tried to talk to her but she did not respond. He saw the knife stuck in her neck and pulled it out and covered the deceased with the sheet. He then called his son, explained what had happened and told him to call the police. He tried to speak to his brother but after failing to get a reply spoke to his sister about what had happened. He went back to the body, placed his hand on her heart and suspected that she may still be alive. He called his son again and told him to call the ambulance and police. 
     
      
    49 The appellant accepted that he participated in a record of interview with the police but said that he did not tell them about the cucumber as he did not want to say anything negative about the deceased and nor could he bring himself to tell the police about how she had sworn about him and members of his family. 
     
      
    50 In cross examination the appellant denied that the deceased worked for him but agreed that Mrs Assad had introduced them. The appellant repeatedly denied that he had wanted the relationship to continue and also denied that he had told his sister that he wanted the deceased to come and live in Melbourne with him. 
     
      
    51 The appellant also denied that he had lied to his son about the relationship being over. He said that his son would give him money whenever he wanted it.  
     
      
    52 The appellant’s counsel conceded that the appellant had previously said in his evidence in 2001 that maybe he had lied to his son. The appellant agreed that he was spending money on the deceased right up until her death.  
     
      
    53 The appellant’s counsel conceded that the appellant had previously said in his evidence in 2001 that he had spoken to the deceased alone at her home and said “I will give you whatever you want, won’t you change your mind.” The appellant now denied saying those words or that they meant he was trying to induce her to go to Melbourne with her. 
     
      
    54 The appellant also denied that he was upset when he visited the deceased’s home on 14 February 2000 and was shown photographs of the deceased’s son’s 21st birthday party. He agreed that he had asked, words to the effect “How come you didn’t invite me?” He said that Mr Diab thought that he was upset. 
     
      
    55 The appellant was taken through the events of 17-18 February 2000 in the hotel room and denied that he had planned to kill the deceased. The appellant was questioned about not recalling what happened after she swore at him and he was taken to his evidence in 2001. He had previously been asked about what he did after he took the knife off the deceased and he had responded by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I hit her but I how I did, I hit her, or where did I hit her, I don’t know. I fell to the ground and then I got up and I don’t know what happened.” 
        
       
      
    56 He was then asked why he tried to take the knife off her and he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to keep the knife away from me and her, this is what I thought about but she didn’t let me, she didn’t give me a chance to.” 
        
       
      
    57 He was then asked what happened to which he responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is what happened, like I told you I hit her, I stabbed her and I got up from the floor and found her next to me.” 
        
       
       
      The trial judge’s summing up 
       
      
    58 His Honour was required to direct the jury in a manner consistent with s 23 of the Crimes Act which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where:  
         
         
          
          (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased, 
          
         
         
         whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time. 
         
         
        (3) For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if:  
         
         
          
          (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
          
         
         
        (4) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation. 
         
         
        (5) This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder. 
        
       
      
    59 The trial judge commenced the summing up by giving the standard directions of general application. His Honour identified the fact that there was no question in the trial but that the appellant’s actions had caused the death of the deceased. His Honour also identified the fact that the appellant’s actions were carried out with an intention either to kill or cause really serious bodily harm. The issue in the case was confined to the question of provocation. 
     
      
    60 His Honour was careful to identify for the jury that the concept of provocation as understood in the criminal law may be different from a lay person’s impression of provocation. His Honour identified that it was not for the accused to prove that he was acting under provocation but for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was not. His Honour gave the jury the following summary of the relevant law: 
     
      
       
        
        “You heard the learned Crown Prosecutor in his address refer to two questions which arise, and I shall now take you to them. The law provides that an act causing death is an act done under provocation where: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The act is a result of a loss of self control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased, including grossly insulting words or gestures towards or affecting the accused. That is the first matter. And I use the word “and”, members of the jury, which you know is a conjuctive; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The conduct of the deceased was such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, where that follows from the conduct of the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    61 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So members of the jury, these principles of law require you to consider the following question or questions. The first question is this: 
        
       
       
        
        1. May the deceased’s conduct, that is the things which she did or said or both, have induced, that is caused, the accused to lose his self control and, again, members of the jury, that depends upon your findings of fact. If you were to find, and I will come back to this again, that you find that you accept as a fact that certain of the gestures or statements made by the deceased occurred, then members of the jury, that is a matter which you take into account in determining the questions which I posed to you, including the first question which I shall repeat again before going on any further. 
        
       
       
        
        First question is, may the deceased conduct, that is the things she did or said, depending upon what you find, or both, have induced, that is caused, the accused to lose his self control.” 
        
       
      
    62 His Honour then directed the jury’s attention to the relevant facts, including the evidence of Mr Moses, reminding them that if the words allegedly said by the deceased to the accused relating to his relatives, particularly his mother, were said then it could be particularly hurtful to a person of the accused’s ethnic background. His Honour also drew attention to the allegation that the deceased said she would like to do certain things with a cucumber to the appellant’s daughter. 
     
      
    63 Having dealt with these matters his Honour turned attention to what he described as the second question being: 
     
      
       
        
        “May the conduct of the deceased have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far have lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, serious bodily harm, on the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    64 This question is, of course, raised by s 23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    65 His Honour then continued in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, an ordinary person is simply one who has the minimum powers of self control expected of an ordinary citizen who is sober and of the same age and sex of the accused. I might add, members of the jury, that even though some beer had been drunk there is no suggestion raised from the evidence that anybody was intoxicated at the time, whether the accused or the deceased. No suggestion has been raised in evidence that that would be the case.” 
        
       
       
        
        When one speaks of the effect of provocation on an ordinary person, in the position of the accused, that phrase means an ordinary person who has been provoked to the same degree of severity and for the same reason as the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case this translates to a person with the minimum powers of self control of an ordinary person as I have described to you earlier, who is subjected to the words allegedly spoken by the deceased immediately before the lethal events occurred. The gestures allegedly made by the deceased involving both the use of the cucumber and, of course on the accused’s evidence the use of the knife by her. And you take into account, if you were to find that you accepted those things happened, in determining whether it occurred to a person having the minimum powers of self control of a person, same sage, sex, as the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        This question requires you to take full account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused but eliminates from your consideration an extraordinary response, if you find there such to be, by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus, extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary loss of self control does not confer any protection against a conviction for murder. 
        
       
       
        
        You should understand that when you are dealing with this question you are considering the possible reaction of an ordinary person in the position of the accused and not his inevitable, or probable reaction, but his possible reaction. 
        
       
       
        
        If the answer to this second question is “no”, the Crown has negatived provocation, and if you find that all other elements of murder have been established beyond reasonable doubt the appropriate verdict is guilty of murder. If the answer to the question is “yes”, the Crown has failed to negative provocation, and the appropriate verdicts a not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    66 Immediately following these directions his Honour took an adjournment. In the absence of the jury his Honour indicated that he had dealt with the directions of law which he wanted to give in relation to provocation. He asked of counsel: “Anything so far gentlemen?” 
     
      
    67 Senior counsel who appeared for the appellant raised two matters. One related to his Honour’s direction in relation to character and the second matter raised the direction given in relation to provocation. A discussion ensued as to whether or not when describing the ordinary person the full description of a person with the personal attributes of “age, sex, race, ethnic or cultural background, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships, or past history” needed to be repeated on every occasion or whether it was adequate to refer to someone as an ordinary person “simply one who has minimum powers of self control expected of an ordinary citizen who is sober and of the same age and sex as the accused.” His Honour did not accept that a full description was necessary on every occasion. 
     
      
    68 No other matter was raised by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Issues in the appeal 
       
      
    69 Senior counsel who appeared for the appellant on the appeal was not the same as senior counsel who appeared at the trial. Both are counsel of considerable reputation and experience in the criminal law. 
     
      
    70 Two complaints are now made about the directions given by the trial judge. The first relates to the issue of provocation and the second to the matter of lies and consciousness of guilt. Neither matter was raised at the trial and leave is accordingly required before either matter can be raised in this Court: rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. As Hunt AJA recently confirmed in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20 the requirements of r 4 are not “some mere technicality” to be “simply … brushed aside.” An obligation falls upon defence counsel to assist the trial judge to give appropriate directions to the jury. Only if an identified error in the summing up has caused a miscarriage of justice, in respect of which the onus lies upon the appellant, will leave be granted [24]: see also R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [74] and Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 esp McHugh J at 319. 
     
      
       
      Provocation 
       
      
    71 No complaint is made about the trial judge’s direction with respect to provocation but for the sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary loss of self control does not confer any protection against a conviction for murder.” 
        
       
      
    72 It is submitted that when read in the context of the immediately preceding sentence where reference was made to an “extraordinary response by the accused to the provocation actually experienced ….” reference to “extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary loss of self control” impermissibly directs the jury’s attention to the physical character of the appellant’s response to the alleged provocation having regard to the provision of s 23(3)(a) of the Crimes Act. It is submitted that where, as the evidence in the present case indicates, the deceased’s death was caused by repetitive knife blows to various parts of her body it was necessary to exercise particular care in the directions because of the risk that the jury would be diverted by the physical intensity of the attack into considering whether the response of the appellant to the alleged provocation was reasonable and in proportion to the alleged provocation when determining whether the Crown had established that the appellant had not acted in response to the deceased’s alleged acts of provocation. 
     
      
    73 The appellant recognises that the directions which the trial judge gave originate from the directions in relation to provocation provided in the Supreme Court Criminal Trial Bench Book where a standard direction is provided in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “This question requires you to take full account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from your consideration an extraordinary response (if such there be) by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus extraordinary aggressiveness or extraordinary want of self control on the part of the accused confers no protection against conviction for murder.” 
        
       
      
    74 The only difference of substance, but in the appellant’s submission of great significance, is the inclusion by the trial judge of the word “act” when his Honour refers to an “extraordinary act of aggressiveness” as not conferring protection. 
     
      
    75 The genesis of the standard direction was identified, in my opinion correctly, by counsel as being the judgment of Brennan CJ in Green v The Queen (1996-1997) 191 CLR 334. When considering s 23 the Chief Justice stated (at 339) in respect of subs (2)(a) that it: 
     
      
       
        
        “contains no test of proportionality between the conduct of the deceased and the act or omission which causes the death.” 
        
       
      
    76 When dealing with subs (2)(b) his Honour stated (at 340) that it: 
     
      
       
        
        “requires the jury to take full account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from the jury’s consideration any extraordinary response by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus extraordinary aggressiveness or extraordinary want of self control on the part of the accused confer no protection against conviction for murder.” 
        
       
      
    77 It was submitted that this statement by the Chief Justice was apt to mislead especially if included in directions given to the jury. The problem which was identified is that, as Gummow J states in Green, “paragraph (b) does not allow consideration of the actual act or omission of the accused causing death and hence there is no occasion for a consideration of the proportion between those acts or omissions and the conduct of the deceased.” at 378 (see also McHugh J at 373) 
     
      
    78 Although the Crown accepts that the trial judge’s direction and the model direction could be more felicitously expressed, it is submitted that the sentence complained of must be understood in context and as it would have been understood by the jury and defence counsel at the trial. Central to that context is the question to which his Honour was directing attention, being whether the deceased’s conduct may have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed the requisite intent. 
     
      
    79 In my opinion, the Crown’s submission should be accepted. In the paragraph preceding the paragraph complained, of his Honour repeatedly refers to and describes the relevant attributes of the “ordinary person.” Having reminded the jury of the alleged acts of provocation his Honour then emphasises, in the paragraph about which complaint is made, that the question which has to be answered is whether the response of the accused is the response which an ordinary person would make to the acts of provocation. Provocation is confined to the circumstances where the response of the ordinary person could result in the formation of an intention to kill. If the response is extraordinary, because it would not be that expected from an ordinary person, it takes from the accused the partial defence. Understood in this context his Honour’s reference to an “extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary loss of self control” does not raise for consideration whether the response was proportionate to the deceased’s conduct but merely whether it was the response to be expected from the ordinary person. An extraordinary act of aggressiveness or extraordinary loss of self control is not the response of the ordinary person. 
     
      
    80 It is important to bear in mind that even if the direction given by the trial judge carried the possibility that it may have been misunderstood and accordingly, misused by the jury, and I incline to the view that it did not, the appellant was represented by counsel who, although he took up other aspects of his Honour’s direction, did not raise any issue with the controversial sentence. This could either be because he understood the sentence in context to be consistent with s 23 or may have been for other forensic reasons. It must be remembered that the significant issue in the trial was whether the alleged acts of provocation occurred at all. The veracity of the evidence of the appellant on this matter came under significant challenge and was the subject of discussion by the trial judge which in some respects was unfavourable to the appellant. However, the ferocity of the appellant’s attack, although undeniable, was not emphasised in the summing up. If defence counsel had sought a redirection on that matter the inevitable consequence would have been to attract attention to the actual nature of the attack which, notwithstanding directions given by his Honour, may have operated to the detriment of the accused. 
     
      
    81 To my mind, those considerations are determinative of this ground of appeal. On at least this second occasion the appellant was represented by experienced senior counsel who, it must be accepted, gave deep consideration to the appellant’s defence and was alive to any difficulties presented during the trial. If he had considered that his Honour’s directions were likely to have misled the jury I have little doubt that the matter would have been raised. 
     
      
    82 In the circumstances I am not satisfied that any injustice has occurred and I would deny leave pursuant to r 4. 
     
      
       
      Failure to give directions on consciousness of guilt 
       
      
    83 The Crown case at the trial was that the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had negatived provocation. It was submitted, inter alia, that the jury would totally reject the account given by the appellant as to the events which gave rise to the stabbing of the victim because, so it was submitted, any objective analysis of the appellant’s evidence demonstrated that he was a liar. 
     
      
    84 The Crown firstly relied upon the interview conducted by Sgt Karras at the hotel in the early hours of 19 February 2000 which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Did you have a shower? 
         
        A. Yes, before the police came I had a shower and put the clothes on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you have a shower? 
         
        A. Because of blood. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you stab this woman? 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why was the lady standing or lying on the bed? 
         
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you get the knife? 
         
        A. I bring it for the woman, she asked me to bring the knife.” 
        
       
      
    85 The appellant subsequently participated in a record of interview during the course of which the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was the conversation about? 
         
        A. We were, we stayed until midnight, there was nothing, she went to sleep and I went to sleep. Because I was in bed, she went to the toilet, she came back and she was saying that she was joking with me, she was playing with the knife, swinging it. I tried to get the knife off her, she hit me on my finger. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that the finger on your left hand, the one with the bandage on it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s the finger you were talking about, yes, OK. What happened after that? 
         
        A. I don’t know what happened. I took the knife and I found her on the floor, she was dead on the floor after two hours. I called my son and I asked him to call the police to tell them what happened with me. The police came. The police came and they said, what’s happened? The knife was still in my hand and I told them that I, that the woman is dead.  
        
       
      
    86 Later in the record of interview, the following was recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Were you laying down? 
         
        A. When I turned around I thought she was coming to sleep with me. Suddenly I saw her playing right away with the knife. The first one was on here, indicating to, if I could continue during the second time, and she said she was joking but the cut was serious and I took the knife off her and I stabbed her. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when Rebecca, when you say Rebecca came out and started waving the knife around where was she? 
         
        A. She opened the fridge and as I said I don’t remember what she had beer, water or something … then she came straight to me. I thought that she was coming to me. She started playing with the knife, she hit me here, and then she hit me on the other finger. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re indicating your finger, your right index finger as well as the left one, is that correct? 
         
        A. But then I will – she hit me on the other finger, then all of a sudden I saw myself taking the knife off her. I don’t know what happened after that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But before you just said you stabbed her. 
         
        A. After she hit me, yes, I did stab her. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. OK, before she fell on you. When you say you thought she was joking and playing around with the knife what was she saying, what gave you the impression that she was joking? 
         
        A. I said, why do you have the knife in your hand? She said I’m kidding, joking with you. I told her to put it back in the bag. She said yeah, yeah, all right. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I took the knife and then she fell on me because her knee hit my shoulder, my shoulder is hurting, and then I didn’t know what happened, I told myself that I killed her. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right. Where did you stab her, sir, where? 
         
        A. I don’t know, when I woke up I didn’t know why I did that and I covered her with a sheet. 
        
       
      
    87 In 2001, at his first trial, the appellant gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. 2001 you were asked: Why did you try to take the knife off her? 
         
        A. In order to keep the knife away from me and her just I thought about but she didn’t let me, she didn’t give me a chance to… 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So what happened? 
         
        A. This is what happened, like I told you I hit her, I stabbed her and I got up from the floor and I found her next to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How were you, at the time she was attacking you with the knife how were you feeling, what was in your mind? 
         
        A. All I was, all I had in my head was to get the knife away from her hand but I couldn’t do that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you want to get the knife away from her hand? 
         
        A. In order to put it aside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Put it aside? 
        
       
       
        
        A. So, in order for me to get it away from her and me.” 
        
       
      
    88 In the course of the retrial in 2004, the appellant gave the following evidence in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What happened next? 
         
        A. When she came back she said ‘every time I spend some moments with you or time with you together some of your children call us and disturb us.’ I tried to talk to her calmly because she was getting a little bit edgy and I didn’t want her to be edgy. I said ‘come and sit next to me on the bed and lets talk it over’. She come and sat next to me and wanted to make love again. I said ‘I can’t do it anymore because I am very tired. If you wait until the morning we can have another go at it. Let’s have a chat together and let’s put it off until the morning but not necessarily at this moment.’ She got up and she was swearing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was she saying? 
        
       
       
        
        A. She said ‘your mother is a slut. I am going to fuck your mother. All your children are sluts and hopeless’ and she went to a table. There were fruit and vegetables on the table. She used a cucumber on her vagina and on her rectum. I got up and said ‘please stop doing that.’ When I pushed her the cucumber fell to the floor. And she was – she was, at the moment screaming and shouting and swearing at my mother and my children and she had the cucumber that she wanted to use. I said ‘this cucumber is better than you.’ She said ‘this cucumber I need to use it on your daughter because she has her birthday the following day. Because her husband cannot sleep with her and I want to use it on her. I want to use that cucumber on her because she is a slut.’ The cucumber fell to the floor. I knelt to get hold of it. She hit me with her foot on my shoulder. I got up, I said ‘why are you hitting me for?’ She said ‘I want to kill you, you son of a bitch.’ She grabbed the knife and she attacked me. As I was retreating I fell on the bed. She jumped on top of me. She said ‘I want to kill you, you son of a bitch, I want to kill you, I want to kill you.’ That was the last thing I know. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         I swear to God that – my whole body was burning I couldn’t even take a breath because I was so upset and insulted.” 
        
       
      
    89 The submission of the Crown at the second trial was that the jury would be satisfied that after consideration of the evidence of the appellant and a comparison of that account with earlier accounts his evidence at the trial was fabricated. Attention is drawn by the appellant to the address of prosecuting counsel which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s my suggestion to you that the only real issue in this case is whether the accused has raised evidence to suggest that he was provoked into stabbing her. 
        
       
       
        
        You will recall I cross-examined the accused, not only had he said or claimed that Rebecca used those words and did what he claimed she did with the cucumber, I reminded him that in 2001, in addition to those claims, he said other things were running through his mind. And you will recall I went through the exercise of reminding him of the questions he was asked back in 2001 and the answers he gave. Well, he had put forward that he had had two different states of mind at the relevant time. 
        
       
       
        
        You will be satisfied after careful examination of the evidence that the accused has fabricated the words and gestures he claimed Rebecca used towards him. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to my submission to you that the accused has been telling you lies about, when he has been trying to put forward this part of the defence. 
        
       
       
        
        He has also, I suggest to you in the interview he had with the police, and you have the videotape before you, and the interview with Detective Karras, he lied to police, in particular to his claim that Rebecca was waving a knife around in the lead up to the stabbing. 
        
       
       
        
        I suggest to you what happened afterwards he realised how ludicrous how unbelievable that version was. And what he did, he took advantage of the fact his son Ahmed had phoned him about 11.00 pm on the evening of 17 February 2000 in the hotel room to invent the story he has now put forward. He has used that phone call as being a trigger for his asserted claims of Rebecca using these insulting words towards members of his family. Totally different version what he had given to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        He has invented that story, I suggest to you, Rebecca using these insulting words and gestures, in the hope of escaping a murder conviction and securing for himself a manslaughter conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        You recall, and I am not going to take you through it, I reminded him of questions he was asked in 2001 and the answers he gave which suggested he had a little bit more of a memory for what had occurred, at least back then. He had this, I suggest, convenient amnesia as to what took place. 
        
       
       
        
        He tried to suggest yesterday that he lost consciousness. I think Detective Karras asked him some specific questions about that and his answers were, in effect, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Well, he didn’t want to tell you what happened. I suggest he does know what happened, what took place at the time. He doesn’t want to tell you because if he was to tell you the truth it would implicate him. 
        
       
       
        
        His version in this courtroom has certainly shifted from the version he gave police.” 
        
       
      
    90 In the course of his summing up, the trial judge said, before taking the jury to the relevant evidentiary passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown, you will recollect, argued that you would totally reject the account given to you by the accused as to the events which gave rise to the stabbing of the deceased because the Crown argues that an objective analysis of the accused’s evidence demonstrates that he is a liar. And the Crown in that regard argued that when you looked at the various accounts given by the accused from the time of his apprehension to the evidence he gave before you that the discrepancies which occurred in that evidence are such as to give rise to you finding that the accused is not a witness of truth.” 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour later stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that when you look at what he said in the past, what he says now you wouldn’t accept him.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s submission 
       
      
    92 The appellant submits that at no stage in the summing up were the jury given any directions as to how they were to consider in their fact finding process the evidence of the appellant which was said to contain lies. It is submitted that Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 required that the jury should have been given guidance in relation to lies which may have been told by the appellant. Attention was drawn to the familiar passage in Broadhurst v the Queen [1964] AC 441 at 457: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a natural tendency for a jury to think that if an accused is lying, it must be because he is guilty, and accordingly to convict him without more ado. It is the duty of the judge to make it clear to them that this is not so.” 
        
       
      
    93 It was further submitted that this is not a case where the approach taken by this Court in R v Hodge [2002] NSWCCA 10 has relevance. In that matter the Court held that the case had been conducted on the basis that any lie told did not go to a consciousness of guilt in the accused and, as such, a direction on lies was not required. Attention is also drawn by the appellant to the decision of this Court in R v Sievers [2004] NSWCCA 463 where the majority of the Court held that an Edwards-type direction was appropriate where the only issue was whether or not a verdict of manslaughter should be entered on the basis of provocation. 
     
      
       
      The submissions of the Crown 
       
      
    94 The respondent draws attention to the address of the Crown Prosecutor at the trial and the instances in which it was suggested that the appellant had been untruthful. It is submitted that only in relation to evidence which the appellant gave that he had lost consciousness (which had previously been denied to police) could the jury have understood that the appellant may have told lies out of a consciousness that a true account of his actions may indicate that he had committed murder rather than manslaughter. 
     
      
    95 The Crown draws attention to the fact that in the course of summing up to the jury the trial judge gave careful directions in relation to the competing versions of the relevant aspects of the account of events given by the appellant. At an early point in the summing up the trial judge directed the jury that the Crown bore the onus of proving the appellant guilty of murder notwithstanding that the appellant had given evidence. His Honour then directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if you disbelieve what he said that disbelief does not, by itself, amount to material which you can be satisfied by the Crown that the accused is guilty of murder. However, of course, members of the jury, if you do reject what the accused has to say as to the events of the fatal evening then the Crown’s task in satisfying you that he is guilty of murder, will be facilitated.” 
        
       
      
    96 It is submitted that this direction fulfilled any obligation in the circumstances of this case to give directions as to how the jury should consider any lie which they believe the appellant may have told. It was appropriate and adequate for his Honour to direct the jury that it was not permissible for them to conclude that the appellant must have been guilty of murder and not manslaughter simply because they concluded that he had been lying in relation to his account of the events on the fatal evening. Furthermore, it is submitted that the alleged lies, if told, addressed the central factual issue in the case and, if lies, could not have an innocent explanation. That the appellant had lied went to the essential issue in the case which was whether the deceased acted in a manner which provoked the appellant. 
     
      
    97 Accordingly, it is submitted that the directions concerning the onus of proof on the Crown for murder and provocation/manslaughter and lies was sufficient in this case (see Patterson v Regina (Cth) [2001] NSWCCA 316 at [58]-[65]). 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the second ground 
       
      
    98 In my opinion, the Crown’s submissions should be accepted. 
     
      
    99 An essential element of the trial judge’s directions was that the onus of establishing the guilt of the appellant rests upon the Crown, both in relation to establishing the ingredients of the offence of murder and rebutting provocation. His Honour emphasised to the jury that it was prohibited to reason that the appellant must have been guilty of murder and not manslaughter simply because they concluded that he had been lying in relation to his account of the events of the fatal evening.  
     
      
    100 Having regard to the way in which the Crown put the case to the jury, in my opinion, no more was required. The central factual issue in the case was whether the deceased had behaved in the provocative manner alleged by the appellant. A finding that the appellant was guilty of murder was open if the jury concluded that the appellant’s account of the relevant events was a fabrication. However, if the appellant was telling lies about the relevant events this, as his Honour reminded the jury, would not conclude the matter. 
     
      
    101 When submitting that the appellant’s account of the alleged events was unbelievable the Crown was not relying on the lies purely as going to the credit of the appellant or as disclosing consciousness of guilt. Rather the Crown’s submission was that the appellant’s account of the events was unbelievable (see Patterson v Regina (Cth)). 
     
      
    102 Apart from these matters, as with the first ground of appeal, no application was made for any further directions relevant to this ground despite two express invitations from the trial judge. 
     
      
    103 Having regard to the careful directions of the trial judge in relation to the onus carried by the Crown and the extent, if any, to which the jury could use a conclusion that the appellant had told untruths, it is not surprising that senior counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial was content not to invite further directions on the subject of lies. It is unlikely that any further attention to this aspect of the evidence would have raised a favourable impression of the appellant in the minds of the jury. In particular the appellant’s explanation for not having mentioned the complete circumstances of the allegedly provoking events when interviewed by the police, being because of his concern for the deceased’s reputation, was hardly credible. Any return to these matters, even to inform the jury of some of the conventional difficulties when lies may have been told, would be likely to have reinforced any adverse conclusion which the jury may otherwise have reached in relation to the appellant. 
     
      
    104 In these circumstances I am completely satisfied that there were legitimate tactical considerations inherent in senior counsel not seeking further directions on these matters and I would decline leave pursuant to rule 4 in relation to this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The proviso to s 6(1) of  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912. 
       
      
    105 The Crown submits that even if leave was granted no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and accordingly the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied.  
     
      
    106 The Crown further submits that a “properly instructed jury acting reasonably would inevitably convict the appellant of murder on the basis that there is no reasonable doubt that the appellant had not killed the deceased under provocation.”  
     
      
    107 It is submitted in the alternative that “even if a properly instructed jury accepted that the appellant might have killed the deceased under provocation, that jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an ordinary person subject to the same degree and nature of provocation as the appellant alleged, could not so far have lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite for murder.” 
     
      
    108 In the circumstances it is unnecessary to finally determine these submissions. However, to my mind, the Crown case was strong and for the reasons I have previously indicated I am not persuaded that there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    109 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Upon call for John Keith Bryce he does not appear. 
     
      
    2 On 11 July 2005 an application for leave to appeal was filed in this Court against the sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ at Sydney District Court on 23 July 2004 relating to two charges of possess housebreaking implements and a charge of break and enter with intent. 
     
      
    3 The appeal was filed by the Legal Aid Commission on behalf of the applicant. The matter was listed for callover on 4 August 2005 when the Legal Aid Commission advised that the applicant had escaped from custody. The matter was stood over for further mention on 15 September 2005 and on that date was again stood over until 27 October 2005. 
     
      
    4 On 27 October 2005 the Legal Aid Commission withdrew from the matter. The matter was then listed before the Court on 2 December 2005, that is today. 
     
      
    5 Enquiries made on 28 November 2005 to the sentencing administration section of the Department of Corrective Services revealed that the applicant was not in custody as at that date and he had escaped on 11 July 2005. No notification of listing of this matter before the Court today has been sent to the applicant because the Registry is unaware of his current address, given the information that he has escaped from lawful custody. 
     
      
    6 Nevertheless, in the circumstances the matter is put before the Court to be dismissed for want of prosecution. 
     
      
    7 I propose that the appeal be dismissed for want of prosecution. 
     
      
    8 SULLY J: I agree. 
     
      
    9 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    10 GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

    1 STUDDERT J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Howie J and the orders that he proposes. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by Judge Karpin (the Judge). On 26 November 2004 the applicant was sentenced on one count of larceny by a servant to a non-parole period of 15 months with a parole period of 19 months. The non-parole period is to expire on 25 February 2006 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole on conditions imposed by the Judge and relating to supervision of the applicant by the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    4 The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty arose from her employment with Thomas Cook Travel. The charge alleged that between 18 July 1999 and 7 October 2000 the applicant stole cash from her employer. The allegation was that over this period of about 15 months the applicant had by numerous acts of dishonesty stolen $135,199.40. The offence was contrary to s 156 of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 The relevant chronology is that the applicant commenced employment with Thomas Cook in May 1996. Her criminal activity first came to the notice of her employer in October 2000 and on 11 October 2000 her employment was terminated. She was not charged with any offence, however, until 9 September 2002. She was arraigned before the District Court on 24 April 2003 and was to stand trial on 7 September 2004. The trial was estimated to have a duration of 10 weeks but on the trial date the applicant pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    6 There was an agreed statement of facts placed before the court. It is unnecessary to detail the manner in which the applicant was able to steal money from her employer. It is sufficient to state that it involved the abuse of the position she held as the custodian of one of the tills in the Queen Victoria branch from July 1999. The applicant committed numerous fraudulent acts in order either to obtain the money or to conceal discrepancies that would have arisen as a result of her thefts. These included making electronic transfers to her till from other tills that were unoccupied by the persons in charge because the person was off duty or on leave. There were occasions when the applicant received large sums of cash but delayed entering their receipts into the system until some days or weeks after receiving the money. There were numerous occasions when the applicant made false entries in order to conceal the deficiencies in her till. She also drew cash advances from her own credit card using a false authorisation number. 
     
      
    7 In relation to the delay in charging the applicant the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The complexity of the accounting system and the considerable trouble the prisoner had taken to cover her defalcations undoubtedly would have combined to produce the need for a complex and time consuming audit involving the physical inspection of large number of Thomas Cook (documents) and bank records. Clearly this was done with no assistance from the prisoner. 
         
         
        Approximately 1600 documents were identified, analysed, collated and audited in order to establish the totality of the prisoner’s theft from her employer……….” 
        
       
      
    8 The Judge noted that the applicant had no criminal offences recorded against her prior to this spate of offending but that she had since leaving that employment been charged and convicted of offences arising from her subsequent employment with NRMA. In June 2002 the applicant was placed on a bond in respect of three offences arising from fraudulently altering her payslips to her mother’s name in order to assist her mother obtain a personal loan. The Judge correctly indicated that these matters reflected adversely on the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was born on 3 September 1973 in Lebanon. Her father was a police officer and shortly after her birth the family went to Tripoli. At this time there was civil war and her father sent the family to the safety of a village in the north. In 1984 the family migrated to Australia. She is a member of a very close knit and extended family. She and her parents were living with a brother at the time of sentencing. The applicant had been engaged to the same man for nine years. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was a highly successful student. She obtained a law degree from Sydney University but has never practiced law. She also obtained a Bachelor in Business from the University of Western Sydney. She commenced working for Thomas Cook in 1996 and in 1997 was the victim of an armed robbery at the office in Sydney Airport. The applicant’s brother gave evidence of the effect of this event upon the applicant and there is evidence to suggest that she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result. She was off work for six months because of stress and depression. She returned to work although her brother believed she had not fully recovered. 
     
      
    11 The applicant did not give evidence before her Honour and had denied the offences up until she pleaded guilty. The brother was unable to offer any explanation for the commission of the offences or what happened to the money. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Thus the Court is left with no explanation for the prisoner’s conduct over a period of more than a year, during which she used her knowledge, her impressive intelligence and her ability cunningly and persistently to thieve and cover up her thefts. Because she is highly intelligent she devised various means of circumventing the procedures designed to prevent employees from stealing. She was successful for a considerable period and she engaged in careful and sophisticated procedures of her own which must have required considerable forethought. 
         
         
        She has provided no explanation for her conduct, has made, and will make, no restitution and her conduct involved a serious breach of trust by an employee. It was not an isolated incident, not a sudden moment of giving into temptation. It was well planned, persistent and determined theft from her employers for whom she had already worked for several years at the time she commenced her stealing. No doubt her record of employment over several years was a motivating factor in promoting her to the control of a till. 
        
       
      
    12 There was in evidence a number of medical and psychiatric reports as to the applicant’s poor physical and mental health at the time of sentencing and for some years previously. There is a ground of appeal asserting that her Honour failed to give proper weight to the applicant’s psychiatric condition at the time of the offending and I will deal with the evidence concerning her psychiatric condition when considering that ground of appeal. However, it should be noted that, notwithstanding that the applicant pleaded guilty on the day set down for the trial, the Judge gave her a discount of 20 per cent based upon the utility of the plea but taking into account her “mental state at the time of trial”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – “The learned sentencing judge misapplied the applicable provisions of s 44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ” 
      
    13 As has been noted, the Judge sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period and specified the balance of the term. The pronouncement of the sentence in that way accords with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (the Act) as it is presently drafted and as it was at the time that sentence was pronounced. However, the section in this form had replaced a section worded differently and requiring the court to, firstly, set the term of the sentence and, secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence. Because the applicant’s offence was committed before 1 February 2003, the relevant form of s 44 was that which had been replaced and not that which was existing at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    14 It is submitted on the applicant’s behalf that this error led to an injustice as the Judge found special circumstances which led to a longer total sentence being imposed. The argument is that the Judge must have determined the non-parole period first and then, having found special circumstances, extended the balance of the term to reflect that finding. 
     
      
    15 Such an argument succeeded in this Court in two related appeals, R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218 and R v Tobar (2004) 150 A Crim R 104. It failed in R v Simon [2005] NSWCCA 123. In Simon it was argued that Judge Coolahan had extended the balance of the term by a finding of special circumstances. In dismissing the appeal, and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice and Justice Studdert, I said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        26 The decision in R v Tobar followed a decision of this Court in R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218. The applicant in R v P was a co-offender of the two applicants in R v Tobar. The same District Court Judge sentenced all of the applicants. In his reasons for sentencing CP, the applicant in R v P, the Judge indicated that, in sentencing for one of the two offences before the Court, he started with the standard non-parole period that applied to the offence and then deducted from that figure a specified amount to reflect the fact that the applicant was a juvenile. Having by this mathematical approach determined what the non-parole period should be, the sentencing judge then fixed the balance of the term by finding that there were special circumstances.  
         
         
        27 In those circumstances and with the Judge’s reasoning so exposed, this Court had little difficulty in concluding that his Honour had erred in the way that it is argued that Judge Coolahan erred in the present case. However, in respect of the other offence for which CP was sentenced and where the Judge had not exposed his reasoning in determining the non-parole period and the balance of the term, the Court was not prepared to find that the Judge had made the same error.  
         
         
        28 In R v Tobar the Court concluded that the sentencing judge had determined the non-parole period before deciding upon the balance of the term in respect of each of the applicants then before the Court in the same way as he had done when sentencing CP. The Crown conceded that this error had taken place. The Judge wrongly determined the length of the non-parole period before taking into account the existence of special circumstances.  
         
         
        29 The facts in both R v P and R v Tobar were very different from the present case. It is clear that Judge Coolahan was conscious that the finding of special circumstances affected the length of the non-parole period and stated as much. But further, he made the finding of special circumstances before determining the length of the non-parole period. In such a case I do not understand why it should be inferred that the Judge only came to consider the effect of the finding of special circumstances when determining the length of the balance of the term and after fixing the length of the non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    16 In the present case before imposing sentence, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The prisoner’s health is relevant to the setting of a variation of the non-parole and parole periods so that she may be released under supervision for a longer than usual period. 
        
       
       
      It is clear that the Judge considered the applicant’s physical and mental health to have been a factor giving rise to special circumstances. As in  
      Simon 
       the Judge referred to this matter before specifying either the non-parole period or the balance of the term. As in  
      Simon 
       I see no reason to assume that the Judge only considered the question of a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence after determining what the term of the non-parole period should be. Further, it seems to me that from what she said the Judge was thinking in terms of a variation in the statutory ratio between the two periods within a predetermined total term of the sentence. 
       
      
    17 Similar errors to that which occurred in the present case have been considered by this Court in R v Mako [2004] NSWCCA 90, R v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123, R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 and R v DF [2005] NSWCCA 259. It was described by the Chief Justice in Cramp as “a technical error of little or no practical significance”. His Honour also stated at [44]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Applicant submitted that by reason of this error the Court was entitled to set aside the sentence and proceed to determine the sentence which it believed should be imposed. The error that has been identified did not affect the exercise of discretion by the trial judge. The Court is able to, and should, resentence the Applicant. However, unless some other aspect of the sentence warrants the Court proceeding to sentence afresh, I would not do so. The error identified is a technical one and does not justify this Court proceeding as if his Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried. 
        
       
      
    18 Therefore, notwithstanding this error, this Court could only intervene to reduce the sentence if it believed that a sentence other than that imposed was warranted at law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In Mako and DF the Court simply corrected the error by resentencing the applicant in terms of the applicable section. In KBM and Cramp the Court found that some other sentence was warranted and resentenced the applicant by reducing the sentence imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    19 A question arose at the hearing of this application as to whether the Court should receive evidence of events occurring after sentence based upon this error alone. The view was taken in Mako, applying the decision of a two judge bench in Hansen [2002] NSWCCA 321 that, as the Court was resentencing the applicant, it could take into account fresh material when exercising its own sentencing discretion. But the passage in the judgment of the Chief Justice in Cramp, set out above, seems to be inconsistent with that approach. However, it is unnecessary to resolve that point because the fresh material in this case, relating as it does to the problems of the applicant in prison, does not by itself warrant this court resentencing the applicant. Therefore the other grounds of appeal must be considered. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The learned sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the applicant’s psychiatric condition during the time the offence was committed. 
      
    20 The complaint is that the Judge only took into account the psychiatric condition of the applicant in relation to determining the ratio between the non-parole period and the period on parole and not in assessing the overall criminality of the applicant in relation to the offence for which she was being sentenced. 
     
      
    21 There was a great deal of evidence as to the psychiatric condition of the applicant at the time of sentence but little as to any psychiatric condition from which she may have been suffering at the time of committing the offence. There was none to suggest that her psychiatric condition had anything to do with the stealing or her other fraudulent activity. 
     
      
    22 There was a report from Dr Grigis dated 14 February 2003. It was relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I first saw this young lady at my Eastwood Medical Centre three years ago, and then at Merrylands. I saw her again today in the City. 
         
         
        Other than the very traumatic experience (the hold up at the Airport office), she has suffered even more emotional trauma when she was wrongly accused of stealing a large amount of money. 
         
         
        This has been devastated (sic). Not only [for] this poor lady but this has destroyed the emotional feelings of all her family (whom I have known for almost 15 years now). 
         
         
        Since that most unfortunate incidence (sic), [the applicant’s] family has watched her almost starving to death because of the severe depression, intractable insomnia, memory deficits, lack of motivation and developing “Anorexia Nervosa”. 
         
         
        Because of that [the applicant] developed “fear of people”, she was having panic attacks, and nightmares. This ended in “Social Phobia”. 
        
       
      
    23 Dr Girgis concluded that a mental state examination of the applicant revealed that she was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, severe anxiety/depression state, has feelings of hopelessness and was anorexic. 
     
      
    24 Dr Do supplied a “medical report” dated 15 October 2004. She had been treating the applicant since 1998. Dr Do noted that the applicant had been suffering from chronic medical illnesses for several years. These included: Anorexia nervosa; chronic gastritis; congenital cataracts to the eyes; and vocal cord nodule edema causing loss of voice for several weeks. Dr Do also listed one of the applicant’s illnesses as “anxiety and depression” and in that respect commented: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [A]s part of the eating disorder and also due to excessive stress at home and from time to time at work, she also suffers from anxiety and depression. She has been on various anti depression and anti anxiety medication. She is under the care of Dr Baker (Clinical Psychiatrist). 
        
       
      
    25 Dr Do also stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have been seeing [the applicant] on a regular basis for several years. My impression of her is that she is not a physically well person, she has multiple medical problems. There are also multiple stressors in her life. In the past there has been strained relationship with her parents. Currently the charge that she is facing has caused an exacerbation of all the above medical conditions, rendering her very unwell indeed. 
         
         
        Despite her poor health, [the applicant] has always been conscientious and very hard working. She has had several different jobs and positions over the years. She has always enjoyed her work and tried extremely hard to perform well. She spoke often to me about her jobs with a sense of pride. I was astonished to learn of the charge being laid on her. 
        
       
      
    26 Dr Baker came to have care of the applicant from 3 June 2004 and knew nothing of her or her family before that time. He diagnosed the applicant as suffering from Major Depression. Although he could not exclude a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as found by Dr Girgis, Dr Baker believed her clinical condition had deteriorated into Major Depression with Melancholia. He treated the applicant between June and October 2004 with medication and psychotherapy and her condition slowly improved but her prognosis was guarded. 
     
      
    27 In his report dated 15 June 2004 the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The patient’s first episode of depression was about five years ago. She describes having episodes of depressed mood episodically since this time………. 
        
       
      
    28 The applicant’s brother gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. After this armed holdup at the airport when she was working [with] Thomas Cook as a teller there, did you notice that she was at home for a while? 
         
         
        A. Yes I did, indeed I did. 
         
         
        Q. In fact she didn’t go to work for about six months? 
         
         
        A. Six months, that’s correct. 
         
         
        Q. To jog your memory the position is, is it not, that she was being treated, sponsored by her work, by a psychiatrist called Dr Ali and then a Dr Gergis took over from Dr Ali? 
         
         
        A. That’s correct. 
         
         
        Q. After about six months did she get back to work? 
         
         
        A. She did. 
         
         
        Q. In that six months when she was at home what was she like compared to the-- 
         
         
        A. She was very stressful and she wasn’t feeling well at all, she was always down, very uncomfortable, sick. 
         
         
        Q. When she went back to work was she better at the time she went back to work? 
         
         
        A. Not really. 
         
         
        Q. Had she got even a little bit better? 
         
         
        A. No, well - - 
         
         
        Q. I know you’re not a doctor but did she appear better to you when she went back to work after six months? 
         
         
        A. She might have appeared a little better but she’s still not a hundred per cent like she was before the - -  
        
       
      
    29 In cross–examination the following occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Mr Itaoui I think your evidence has been that after the holdup in 1997 your sister remained at home for a period of approximately six months, is that correct? 
         
         
        A. That’s correct sir. 
         
         
        Q. And during that period she was treated by a psychiatrist? 
         
         
        A. Yes she did? 
         
         
        Q. After she returned to work, that is after the six months, did she continue to see a psychiatrist? 
         
         
        A. Sometimes she did but after a while I think she stopped. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know how long after she returned to work did she see a psychiatrist for, was it a short period after she returned to work or a longer period? 
         
         
        A. I would say a short period but I can’t really recall exactly. 
        
       
      
    30 It should be noted that the armed robbery was in 1997 and the offences commenced in July 1999. In the meantime the applicant had obtained a law degree and had been attending university to obtain her business degree. It should also be noted that in 2002 she was well enough to work for the NRMA. 
     
      
    31 On this evidence it is quite impossible to see how the Judge could have found as a fact that the applicant was suffering from any mental illness or disability at the time of the offending. The applicant had the onus of proof in that regard. Dr Grigis’s evidence was quite unspecific as to dates but it might be accepted that the applicant could have been suffering from some symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder when she returned to work. I fail to understand how such a Disorder, even if she were still suffering from its symptoms at the time of the offending behaviour, could possibly have borne any relationship to the crime committed. The brother’s evidence tended against any suggestion that she was mentally ill or disabled at the time of the offences. Dr Do’s report is against the proposition that during her working periods she was suffering any significant mental condition apart from occasional anxiety or depression chiefly as a result of problems at home. The underlined passage from her report refutes any possible inference that the applicant was suffering from some mental illness as Dr Grigis or Dr Baker described at the time of the offending behaviour. 
     
      
    32 The applicant relied in particular upon the following passage in Dr Baker’s report as being relevant to the issue of the applicant’s culpability: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The [applicant’s] extraordinary evidence of being born and growing up during the Civil War in Lebanon (1973-1995) and her subsequently being a victim of robbery at the Sydney Airport in 1997, places this woman at a higher risk of severe psychiatric illness. Similarly the use of the coping style of denial may exacerbate the patient’s condition, resulting in [the applicant] not fully acknowledging situations which she experiences as threatening. This may lead to delayed onset of treatment due to the patient not seeking help. 
        
       
       
      I do not view this opinion as suggesting that the applicant’s behaviour was in any way due to a psychiatric illness such that her culpability was diminished. There was no evidence that at the time of the offences she was experiencing any threatening situations. Her “coping style of denial” may explain her refusal for so long to acknowledge her criminal conduct and may explain her lack of apparent remorse. It raises questions about her prospects of rehabilitation rather than her criminal culpability. 
       
      
    33 In any event the nature of the applicant’s activity in stealing the money and concealing her theft by what the Judge described as “careful and sophisticated procedures of her own which must have required considerable forethought” is inconsistent with any mental disability. The Judge described the thefts as “systematic, planned and sophisticated”. There was no error in these findings and there is no merit in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive in all the circumstances. 
      
    34 This was a difficult sentencing exercise. On the one hand there was the seriousness of the applicant’s criminal behaviour in breach of trust of her employer that clearly warranted a significant prison sentence for the reasons given by the Judge including the importance of general deterrence. 
     
      
    35 On the other hand, the applicant was suffering serious mental and physical conditions of which her Honour was fully appraised. Shortly before imposing sentence the Judge remarked: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The extent to which the prisoner’s undoubted ill health should protect her from adequate punishment for her wrong doing is a troubling issue. 
        
       
       
      The resolution of this issue was one for the sentencing Judge to determine in the exercise of her discretion. 
       
      
    36 As has already been noted, the Judge adopted the unusual course of increasing the discount for the plea of guilty by reason of the applicant’s mental state at the time of sentencing. I do not quite understand the rationale behind that course because the applicant’s mental condition had nothing to do with the utilitarian value of her plea. A late plea is of less utilitarian value than an early plea irrespective of the personal circumstances of the offender. But, even though the Judge’s approach was erroneous, it was to the applicant’s advantage. The Judge specifically took into account that the applicant would spend her time in prison in more difficult conditions than might otherwise be the case because of her physical and mental condition. 
     
      
    37 The applicant contends that a particular error was the failure of the Judge to give sufficient weight to the delay between the commission of the offence and the applicant being charged with the offence. This was a period of nearly two years. However, the Judge specifically referred to this period and indicated that it had to be taken into account in favour of the applicant. 
     
      
    38 I have already noted that the Judge came to a finding that the applicant’s physical and mental condition justified a variation in the ratio between the non-parole period and the period to be served on parole. I am unpersuaded by the applicant’s argument that the Judge failed to take into account sufficiently the applicant’s mental condition in determining the total term of the sentence. Her Honour took into account all relevant facts and sentencing principles and I am far from satisfied that the course adopted by the sentencing judge was outside her sentencing discretion. Although error has been shown in the way the trial judge pronounced the sentencing orders, I am not satisfied that any other sentence is warranted. 
     
      
    39 I propose that the application for leave be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentence quashed. The following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 34 months to date from 26 November 2004. There is specified a non-parole period of 15 months to commence on 26 November 2004 and to expire on 25 February 2006 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of ongoing supply of cocaine contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. This is an offence for which relevantly a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed. The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court and adhered to his plea of guilty before Judge Williams (the Judge). He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 15 months. He is to be released to parole on 11 July 2006. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    2 There was no dispute as to the facts of the three acts of supply of cocaine that gave rise to the offence charged. On 14 January 2004, 27 January 2004 and 4 February 2004, the applicant supplied about a gram of cocaine on each date to an undercover police operative for the sum of $250. He was arrested immediately after the third supply. However, there was a significant dispute between the Crown and the applicant as to the circumstances in which those supplies occurred and, in particular, as to the extent of the applicant’s involvement in the supply of drugs in the community generally. The sentencing hearing took place over almost two days in the course of which the undercover police officer and the applicant gave evidence. 
     
      
    3 The applicant is aged 27 years. He has no prior criminal record. He is a student studying political science as part of a degree in Arts. At the time of his arrest he lived with his girlfriend in an apartment in Bondi that was owned by her father. The Judge accepted that the applicant was a heavy user of cocaine and cannabis. 
     
      
    4 There was in evidence a report of Dr Whitten, a psychiatrist who had been treating the applicant as a result of his use of drugs. The applicant told him that he first started using cocaine at the age 23 and cannabis from the age of 21. He said that he had been supplying drugs to friends for three years before his arrest and saw it as a way of occupying his free time and as a way to socialise with others. 
     
      
    5 The applicant had a disturbed childhood because his father was an international banker and the family were constantly travelling. He told Dr Whitten that he attended 16 different schools in 12 years. His parents’ marriage was marked by his father’s absence and domestic violence. When the applicant was aged 10 his father disappeared and the applicant was left as the carer for his mother who was psychologically unstable. His father died when the applicant was aged 16. His mother resides in Austria and the applicant has a brother in Canada. The applicant returned to Australia at the age of 20 and commenced his studies. However, because of financial problems experienced by his family, he ceased studying after 18 months. The applicant then had a series of jobs until returning to his studies in 2003. 
     
      
    6 Dr Whitten diagnosed the applicant as suffering from depression and a panic disorder and he was placed on a course of anti-depressant medication. He believed that the applicant’s prognosis was good, if he did not receive a custodial sentence, as the applicant intended to complete his studies and continue with his treatment. Dr Whitten was of the opinion that the applicant “bought” friends by supplying drugs because of his lack of self-esteem. He did not believe that the applicant supplied for profit but rather that the friends reimbursed the applicant for the cocaine supplied and that he did not supply outside his circle of friends, 
     
      
    7 There is only one ground of appeal and it relates to the use of a finding that the Judge made about the applicant’s supply of cocaine to his friends and associates. It is not contended that it was not open for the Judge to make that finding, and indeed the applicant admitted as much during the course of his evidence and to Dr Whitten. Rather it is submitted that the Judge erred in taking into account that finding as an aggravating feature of the offence. 
     
      
    8 A number of issues in dispute between the Crown and the applicant were resolved in the applicant’s favour. For example, the Judge was not prepared to find that a large sum of cash in denominations of $100 and $50 notes found by police in the applicant’s premises was the proceeds of drug supplies generally. Nor was the Judge prepared to find that the applicant used scales and a calculator found in the premises for the purpose of supplying drugs. However, the Judge was not prepared to accept that a filofax found in the premises and that contained a list of names and sums of money written against each name was a record of amounts of money that the applicant had loaned to various people. Nor was he prepared to find that the undercover officer had pressured the applicant into supplying drugs to her. 
     
      
    9 The Judge made the following finding during the course of his sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When I have regard to the conversations with the undercover officer, the filofax document and the denominations of the money found in the apartment, I am satisfied that [the applicant] was in the business albeit at the bottom end of the scale of supplying cocaine in that he was available to supply cocaine to persons who became involved in his personal milieu. 
        
       
       
      The Judge also found that the applicant believed that the undercover officer was part of the group of people with whom he associated. 
       
      
    10 The Crown asserted to the Judge that the applicant was a supplier of drugs generally by relying upon the scales found in the apartment and other objects that the Crown said were the indicia of a drug supplier. But, as I have already indicated, the Judge was not prepared to make that finding other than that he supplied to a circle of friends. Although the Crown was relying upon its assertion of the fact that the applicant was a drug supplier as a matter of aggravation, the Judge did not make that finding. 
     
      
    11 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Judge erroneously relied upon the fact that the applicant supplied to his friends in order to increase the sentence beyond the criminality contained in the charge before the court and so breached the principle in De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
    12 In R v Smiraldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47 this Court considered the relevant principles to be applied when sentencing for an offence under s 25A. Hulme J after indicating that the amount supplied was a relevant consideration, wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        15 On the other hand, it would be wrong to look merely at the quantity supplied on the occasions which led to a conviction and attempt to judge an offender's conduct by that quantity and those provisions of the Act which impose penalties for supply and grade those penalties by reference to quantity. The persons at whom s25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation. As great a quantity of a prohibited drug may be supplied by a series of small transactions as by a few large ones and one may anticipate that most offenders charged under s25A will have been involved in the supply of far more than the particular quantities the subject of the occasions which have inspired the charge.  
         
         
        16 But there are likely to be constraints on how far it is permissible to go in any assessment of any overall quantity supplied in an offender's operation. Any conclusion that he or she had supplied a specified quantity, or at least that quantity, on occasions other than those relied on in the particular charge would run against the principle for which R v De Simone [sic] (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383 is commonly cited that, in sentencing, it is not appropriate to take into account as factors of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another offence which has not been charged.  
         
         
        17 However, subject to that qualification, the sentencing judge was entitled to take other matters into account if they bore on the Applicant's criminality and which were proved in accordance with the standards referred to in R v Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550.  
         
        
       
      
    13 In that case the judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that the supplies had been made in the course of a significant retail business for profit that was open 7 days a week. There was no suggestion that the judge was wrong to sentence the applicant on that basis notwithstanding that the finding indicated other supplies by the offender than those charged against him. 
     
      
    14 In R v Smith [2002] NSWCCA 278 it was held that evidence of the finding of drugs and drug dealing accoutrements in the applicant’s home was “relevant for the assessment of whether or not the present offences represented discrete episodes which were out of character for the applicant……”. In relation to an argument that the sentencing judge wrongly took into account matters giving rise to further offences, Wood CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        12. The decision of this Court in R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 at paras 15 to 17 does not, in my view, support the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant. It was there made clear that a sentencing judge can have regard to those matters which throw light upon the practice or business of the offender standing for sentence, so long as that is not done in a way which would involve taking into account, as matters of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another more serious offence which has not been charged.  
         
        
       
      
    15 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        15. It is not the case that a sentencing judge must confine the consideration of the objective criminality of an offender to the bare minimum of the available facts. Subject to its proper use, a sentencing judge is entitled to have regard to all of the relevant evidence which throws light upon that issue. 
         
        
       
      
    16 In the present case the Judge, after referring to the judgment of Dunford J in R v Hoon and Puna [2000] NSWCCA 137, held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Unfortunately [the applicant] could not be regarded as a retail courier as apparently were the respondents in the above case. He is something more than that……… 
        
       
       
      There is no suggestion that the Judge was wrong in forming that evaluation of the applicant’s role as a drug supplier. 
       
      
    17 It my opinion there is no merit in this ground of appeal. It is plain from a fair reading of the sentencing remarks that the Judge was simply determining the context in which the supplies to the undercover officer occurred. The Judge was clearly entitled, if not required, to consider whether the charged incidents were isolated acts of supply or whether they were part of a course of conduct in which the applicant was engaged and the nature of that conduct. He was simply making an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before him. Although the Crown was submitting that the circumstances surrounding the supply amounted to an aggravating factor, the Judge rejected most of the Crown’s arguments. There is nothing in the remarks on sentence nor in the sentence imposed to support the submission the Judge used his finding as to the applicant’s previous supplies in any way as a matter of aggravation such that he infringed the principle in De Simoni.  
     
      
    18 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    19 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    20 SULLY J: I also agree.  
     
      
    21 GROVE J: The orders of the court are therefore the orders proposed by Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hulme DCJ at Campbelltown District Court.  
     
      
    2 The applicant and a co-offender, Toni Kirby, pleaded guilty to a count of aggravated stealing from the person, an offence which carries the statutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment.  
     
      
    3 Each of the offenders was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years and a total term of three years and four months. Both were arrested and kept in custody from the date of the offence, 30 July 2004. The applicant’s sentence was directed to commence on that date. Kirby’s, for reasons that I will explain, to commence on 30 August 2004. 
     
      
    4 On the evening of 30 July, the victim, an eighteen year old woman, was travelling home by train after attending a TAFE college. She was seated and listening to a walkman. The offenders approached her and, without warning, attacked her. Kirby punched her in the nose and the side of her head which thereby struck the window next to which she was seated. She attempted to retaliate but Kirby punched her in the mouth. The applicant made off with her backpack.  
     
      
    5 A bystander intervened and pulled Kirby away. The offenders went to the vestibule of the carriage and rifled through the backpack. Upon arrival at a station, they alighted. They threw some of the victim’s property onto the railway tracks. Their conduct was reported to transport staff. They were detained and police arrived and arrested them.  
     
      
    6 Among other injuries, the victim sustained a fractured nose, which required closed reduction under general anaesthetic and was performed two weeks after the attack.  
     
      
    7 The applicant presents a single ground of appeal asserting that she has a justifiable sense of grievance, by reason of disparity, between the sentences imposed on her and on Kirby. Subject to the ancillary order for commencement, the sentences were the same and the essential thrust of the applicant’s argument is that she is aggrieved because she justifiably expected to be treated more leniently.  
     
      
    8 The first limb of argument asserted that there should have been a differentiation, to the applicant’s advantage, in the discount received for the pleas of guilty eventually entered by both offenders.  
     
      
    9 Both were charged with robbery in company, an offence which incidentally attracts the same maximum penalty as that to which the guilty pleas were made. By a letter dated 24 September 2004, the applicant’s solicitor sought response to an offer to plead guilty to stealing from the person, in lieu of robbery in company. It was not accepted. I do not regard this offer as relevant.  
     
      
    10 A trial was fixed to commence on 14 March 2005. On 4 March, an offer by the applicant to plead guilty to aggravated stealing from the person was communicated. There was no prior communication on behalf of Kirby but on 14 March, the Crown offered to accept pleas of guilty to aggravated stealing from the person and both offenders pleaded guilty accordingly. The circumstance of aggravation was, of course, infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim.  
     
      
    11 The learned sentencing judge evaluated these pleas and assessed the discount of fifteen per cent for each offender. The extent of assessment, as such, is not challenged but, as noted, the applicant claims there should have been some differentiation in her favour.  
     
      
    12 The only relevant discrimination on this aspect is the making of the offer ultimately accepted by the Crown ten days in advance of trial by the applicant. I do not consider that that provides a factor for sentence assessment which would reasonably aggrieve the applicant in comparing her sentence with that received by Kirby.  
     
      
    13 The second aspect of argument adverted to the respective roles of the offenders. It was put that the applicant took the victim’s bag but Kirby was directly responsible for the violence. Whilst that is an accurate description of physical activity, the statement in that fashion avoids acknowledgment of an essential ingredient of the applicant’s culpability. The Crown has correctly pointed out that the applicant’s guilt of the specific offence involved the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm and the intentional participation of the applicant by lending assistance or encouragement to that violence. It is not a valid approach for comparison to isolate the conduct of the applicant in the taking of the backpack which was the obvious primary target of the criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    14 Next, contrast was sought to be drawn between the ages, maturity and intellectual functioning of the two offenders. The applicant was aged nineteen years and nine months, Kirby aged twenty-seven years and seven months as at the date of offence. They had met whilst in prison and formed a relationship which has not continued. It might be mentioned that the applicant was released to parole after serving the full-time custody portion of her sentence for stealing from the person only shortly before the commission of the current crime.  
     
      
    15 Hulme DCJ had psychological and pre-sentence reports in respect of both offenders. In his remarks on sentence, he made express reference to the applicant’s youth, her presentation to the psychologist as an adolescent rather than an adult, and her personality defects which reflected dysfunctional upbringing, substance abuse and intellectual limitations. He made relevant findings also concerning Kirby.  
     
      
    16 He was alert to the need to give account to such matters, especially in the context of parity and he said; 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing to differentiate their culpability in terms of the offence itself and whilst there may be some differences in the criminal history, in the manner in which I have regarded them I do not find that a reason to distinguish between subjective cases which are otherwise of similar significance. Ms Freeman is obviously younger and less mature than Ms Kirby but their life histories paint a picture to me that makes discrimination between them in the imposition of penalty, inappropriate”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    17 It is not necessary to pause and recite the detail relevant to each offender. I comment that in terms of criminal history the applicant, despite her youth, is less able to call upon prior record as a factor for leniency. His Honour’s conclusion was well open on the evidence and no tainting error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    18 The final complaint concerns the commencement dates of the sentences, the variation in which I indicated I would return to explain.  
     
      
    19 Both offenders were taken into custody and have remained so after 30 July 2004. At the time, there was an outstanding warrant against Kirby for an offence of goods in custody. The warrant was executed and she was sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for three months commencing on 30 July 2004. When sentencing her for the current offence, Hulme DCJ effected partial cumulation by commencing that sentence, which was the same as that received by the applicant, one month later on 30 August 2004. 
     
      
    20 The essence of the applicant’s complaint, is that in terms of minimum full-time custody, Kirby has for this offence had an extension of twenty-two months whereas the applicant received a term of twenty-four months. It is contended that his Honour thereby did not achieve the parity which his remarks indicate he intended.  
     
      
    21 Mr Dhanji, for the applicant, has drawn attention to the observation in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v The Queen 1997 189 CLR 295 that attention be paid to the actual period to be served in consequence of offences committed and, in that case, where cumulation was relevant and co-offenders involved, the real punishment is “the extra period which they must spend in prison”. 
     
      
    22 Mr Arnott SC for the Crown, in a written submission, candidly noted that consideration was given to conceding the appeal to the limited extent of reducing the applicant’s sentence by two months but argued against so doing.  
     
      
    23 The argument raised three aspects. It was said that the disparity derived from a proper application of the principle of totality when sentencing Kirby, that two months is not a “marked” disparity and third, although perhaps marginal, the prior record of the applicant, which included stealing from the person, suggests she is less deserving of lenience than Kirby.  
     
      
    24 Whilst there is force in these submissions, the ultimate question is whether, if the applicant harbours a sense of grievance, it is justifiable. A term of two months, within the span of minimum custody of twenty-four months is not trivial and, within that context, should be characterised as “marked”.  
     
      
    25 I conclude that the applicant has made out a case for adjustment, so as to make the real punishment for the offence, in the sense discussed in Postiglione, equivalent for both offenders.  
     
      
    26 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of one year and ten months commencing on 30 July 2004 and expiring on 29 May 2006, with a parole period of one year and four months commencing on 30 May 2006 and expiring on 29 September 2007.  
       
      3. The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole specified as 29 May 2006. 
      
    27 SULLY J: Yes, I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    28 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    29 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Sorby DCJ. Following trial, the applicant was convicted on a count charging that on 29 July 2003 he approached and spoke to Kevin Wayne Pulver with intent to influence Lesley Joy Pulver in her conduct as a juror in a trial then currently proceeding in which the applicant was one of the accused, an offence contrary to s 323(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment is prescribed. 
     
      
    2 Sorby DCJ also sentenced the applicant following his plea of guilty to harassing a (former) juror on 10 September 2003 for the purpose of obtaining information about the deliberations of a jury contrary to s 68A of the Jury Act 1977. There is no application in respect of this sentence, but it is necessary to refer to it to provide context to the sentence in respect of the other offence. 
     
      
    3 As at 29 July 2003, the applicant was on bail during the currency of a trial before Goldring DCJ and a jury in which he and others were charged with breaking entering and stealing in circumstances of special aggravation. At about 1.30am that day, the applicant entered a service station where Mr Kevin Pulver was on duty. A conversation took place. At the trial of the s 323(b) charge there was dispute as to the exact content of this exchange.  
     
      
    4 In his summing-up his Honour told the jury that it was not in dispute that the applicant said in relation to Mr Pulver’s wife “Ask can she listen to the evidence carefully”. Mr Pulver’s wife Lesley was in fact a juror. He later referred to the evidence of Mr Pulver: 
     
      
       
        
        “He said the accused approached the counter and said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Are you Michelle’s father?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Pulver said he replied, ‘Yes’. The accused then said, Mr Pulver said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘I believe your wife is on the jury’. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Pulver said he then said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Whoa, whoa. This is a matter that should not be discussed’. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Pulver said the accused then told him: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘There is nothing to worry about. Just ask your wife to listen to the evidence carefully’. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Pulver said nothing more but he said he escorted the accused to the door of the shop. Mr Pulver told you that as he escorted the accused to the door of the shop the accused reiterated what he had said earlier. Mr Pulver told you that there was no intimidation or threat made by the accused. Mr Pulver told you that he was not aware at that time that the accused was on trial and that his wife was a juror on that trial.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    5 His Honour later summarised the evidence of the applicant as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “The accused told you that he walked into the service station shop and went straight to the fridge area to get milk. He denied at any stage saying to Mr Pulver, ‘Are you Michelle’s father?’ The accused said Mr Pulver said, ‘Hello’ or something, to which he replied: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘I’m not bad. I’ve just started a trial’. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused said he thought he might have been nervous or stressed out at the time. The accused said Mr Pulver then surprised him by saying: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘I think my wife has been selected or empanelled as a juror’. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused said he then replied: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘If she is on my trial, can she listen to the evidence carefully’. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused told you that he intended nothing by this remark, as he did not know if Mrs Pulver was on the jury of his trial. The accused told you that Mr Pulver responded by saying: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Whoa,whoa. We should not be talking about this’. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused said he then paid for what he had chosen and left the shop. The accused said he did not repeat the phrase to which I have referred as he left the shop”.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    6 In his remarks on sentence Sorby DCJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        “It was agreed between the parties that the following words were spoken by the prisoner to Mr Pulver, ‘I just want you to ask your wife to listen to the evidence carefully’. Whilst there is no dispute as to these words being spoken by the prisoner, the context in which they were spoken was in dispute”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    7 The gravamen of the offence was the intention of the applicant to influence Lesley Pulver in her conduct as a juror. As well as the extract which I have quoted his Honour canvassed the contradictions between the evidence of the applicant and Mr Pulver. He did this in connection with submissions about whether the approach by the applicant to Mr Pulver was planned. His determination of the issue is unclear and the Crown has submitted that his remarks should be interpreted as not finding whether the approach was planned or unplanned. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the submission was persuasive. I consider this court should act in accordance with that submission.  
     
      
    8 The applicant did not approach the juror Mrs Pulver and his act in approaching Mr Pulver only became criminal upon a finding that he intended in that approach to influence her. It follows that it must be found that he intended Mr Pulver to communicate what he had said to his wife. The judge observed that “to influence a juror performing this function (determining whether guilt has been proved) by a person directly involved in the trial, here an accused person facing trial is in my view an objectively serious act” and expressed the conclusion that full time custody and a further period of parole was appropriate.  
     
      
    9 It should not be overlooked that the Crown case did not contend that there was a threat involved or a suggestion to be passed to Mrs Pulver that she act in any way improperly. 
     
      
    10 No evidence can be pointed to which could found a conclusion that Mrs Pulver was in fact influenced. There was some exchange with counsel after conviction, (Transcript 19 August 2005) in which his Honour stated that he understood from some notes that Mr Pulver did tell his wife about it. This was confirmed by the Crown Prosecutor which apparently prompted his Honour’s comment that “it may well have influenced the outcome”. Counsel for the applicant responded that there was some transcript from “the first trial” that she, (Mrs Pulver) had taken a course of action in her own mind long before her husband visited her with the information. The Crown added that they (the jury) had been deliberating for a day and a half and his Honour said that he did not know that, hence that circumstance was apparently not in evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    11 The first argument of the applicant in this Court is that his Honour failed to assess the nature of the influence which the applicant intended in relation to Mrs Pulver. The Crown submits that this is another way of expressing motive, but I do not perceive this to be so. Motive would relate to why the applicant acted, and his Honour appears to have accepted the Crown concession that he did not act with the purpose of securing a favourable result for himself. 
     
      
    12 On any view of the applicant’s action in speaking to Mr Pulver and, rejecting the applicant’s version of the exact content, the influence intended was comprehended in an adjuration to listen to the evidence carefully.  
     
      
    13 As Sorby DCJ instructed the jury, the structure of the section is such that the offence is complete upon any act accompanied by the intended influence on a juror. No doubt it was the intention of the legislature to ensure that no influence of any sort would be intended to be brought to bear on a juror other than in the course of regular proceeding. But on the issue of penalty, it must be germane to assess whether the intended influence was sinister or otherwise and to what degree. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge rightly recognised the importance of the protection of jurors from outside influence, but made no assessment of the quality of the influence intended by the applicant in his act of speaking to Mr Pulver. 
     
      
    15 Although exchanges within the jury room and their deliberations are, except for exceptional reasons, quarantined from examination, it offers a curious paradox in this case that if it were known that a juror did not listen carefully to the evidence there would be reason for disturbance to say the least. If however a juror were to hearken to the applicant’s intended adjuration to listen carefully to it, the duty would be, in that respect, meticulously fulfilled. 
     
      
    16 The intention of the legislature in enacting s 323(b) was clearly to proscribe any act intended to influence a jury in any way whether benign or not. But it does not derogate from acknowledgement of that intention to assess the seriousness of an offence against the presence or absence of sinister connotation. 
     
      
    17 In my view a custodial sentence of twelve months non parole period with a parole term of ten months was manifestly excessive for this offence where the intentional ingredient was of the nature of an exhortation to perform the duty of the juror. That is not to say that the intended act prohibited by the statutory provision does not merit punishment. As I have said the provision criminalises any act accompanied by the requisite intention to influence. 
     
      
    18 I have mentioned the offence contrary to s 68A of the Jury Act. This involved another juror in a trial before Goldring DCJ who, after discharge of the jury which was unable to agree, and some weeks thereafter, was coincidentally at Wollongong Court at the same time as the applicant and one of his co-accused. The juror was in attendance to answer a charge relating to the driving of a motor vehicle.  
     
      
    19 In short, the applicant and his co-accused separately sought and received information from that juror concerning the division between the membership of the panel which had not agreed. The former co-accused pleaded guilty to a similar offence and was placed on recognisance to be of good behaviour by Phelan DCJ who observed that he had been informed that since the inconclusive trial, a nolle prosequi had been determined.  
     
      
    20 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two months for this offence, but it was ordered to be served concurrently with the first two months of the non-parole period for the s 323(b) offence. That sentence has been served and is expired and, as I have noted, no appeal is pursued. I do not need to say anything further about it. 
     
      
    21 The ancillary orders specified the commencement date of 19 June 2005 for both sentences. His Honour found special circumstances for departure from the statutory formula of proportion between non-parole period and total term in the applicant’s favour. I would adopt that finding and his Honour’s reasons. I would also adopt his Honour’s findings concerning the subjective matters relevant to the applicant. 
     
      
    22 As I have indicated, there should be an unmistakable reflection in sentence of both personal and general deterrence against any act intended to influence a juror, but, having regard to content of the applicants particular action in this case, release in the near future would be appropriate.  
     
      
    23 I do not consider that it is necessary to cumulate all or part of the sentence for the offence against the s 68A offence against the Jury Act. Sorby DCJ described it as at the lower end of the scale. Indeed, when told of the facts, (Transcript 22 June 2005 @ p 4) he inquired “how is that an offence?” and was informed accurately of the provision and that “a short number of years ago it wouldn’t have been offence but now it is”. It was accepted that the inquiry was inspired simply by curiosity as to how the jury may have divided and not for any improper motive. 
     
      
    24 I would propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      (1) application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed.  
       
       
      (2) Sentence for the offence contrary to s 323(b) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six months to commence on 19 June 2005 and expire on 18 December 2005 with a parole term of six months commencing on 19 December 2005 and expiring on 18 June 2006.  
       
       
      (3) The applicant ordered released to parole on the 18th of this month

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by English DCJ at Campbelltown District Court. The applicant had been committed for sentence after pleading guilty in the Local Court to four counts of aggravated robbery, for each of which was available a prescribed maximum sentence of twenty five years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 There were also matters which her Honour was asked to take into account in two groups pursuant to the Form 1 procedure. Included in one of these were three further counts of aggravated robbery, two of which were committed on an occasion separate from those to which the counts related. The other was the assault and robbery of an additional victim on an occasion to which the second count related. The other Form 1 was in relation to offences committed some considerable time previously. I will refer to these as the first Form 1 and to the other as the second.  
     
      
    3 The applicant was arrested for unrelated matters on 13 July 2003. They included stealing a motor vehicle, hindering a police officer in the execution of duty, custody of suspected stolen goods, possession of implements to enter or drive a conveyance and serious driving offences. 
     
      
    4 On the following day, 14 July 2003, the applicant was sentenced at Port Macquarie Local Court to an effective overall sentence of twelve months imprisonment with a non parole period of nine months for these offences. He was also on that day charged with the current offences.  
     
      
    5 Her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: On count one and taking into account the first Form 1, to imprisonment for seven years nine months commencing on 14 July 2003; on count two and taking into account the second Form 1, to imprisonment for fifteen years with a non parole period of eight years and nine months, both commencing on 14 July 2003; on count three, to imprisonment for seven years commencing on 14 July 2004; and on count four, to imprisonment for six years commencing on 14 July 2005. All of the sentences on counts one, three and four will expire before the expiry of the non parole period set in connection with the second count, that is to say on 13 April 2012.  
     
      
    6 The effective overall sentence is that imposed on count two, namely fifteen years imprisonment with eight years nine months non parole period.  
     
      
    7 The facts were summarised in an agreed statement. A short description of these events demonstrates the serious criminality in which the applicant engaged.  
     
      
    8 Soon after 7am on Monday 16 June 2003, the applicant and a co-offender, Lea-Caton, drove in a stolen vehicle to the Pendle Hill Newsagency at Pendle Hill. Lea-Caton waited outside while the applicant entered the premises with a shortened .22 calibre rifle. The applicant stepped on to the handbag rail at the service counter and demanded the owner, Mr Bortfield, open the cash register. Mrs Bortfield was also behind the counter at this time. Mr Bortfield complied and emptied the contents of two cash registers, being about $1,361 in total, into the applicant’s outstretched hand. The applicant pointed the rifle in Mr Bortfield’s direction as he took the money. The applicant left the premises and the offenders escaped in the get-away vehicle driven by Lea-Caton.  
     
      
    9 This conduct was comprehended in count one.  
     
      
    10 Count two was reflected in these facts, that ten days later, at about 8am on Thursday 26 June 2003, the applicant and Lea-Caton drove in another stolen vehicle to the Toongabbie Newsagency at Toongabbie. They entered the premises, one armed with a shortened .22 calibre rifle. The newsagent, Mr Cai, was told to hand over the money from two registers but was afraid and could not open the register. Mr Cai’s delivery driver, Mr Chamberlain, and a customer were also at the counter area at this time. The unarmed offender leapt the counter and emptied the registers of about $1,000. They later left in the stolen vehicle.  
     
      
    11 A week later, at about 1.30pm on Tuesday 1 July 2003, the applicant and a co-offender drove in another stolen vehicle to the Liquorland Bottle Shop on Frances Street, Artarmon. They entered the store. The applicant was armed with a .22 calibre firearm. The victim, Mr Kwan, was told to open the register. He complied and handed over $670. The offenders left in the stolen vehicle. Those facts constitute count three. 
     
      
    12 A further week later, at about 4.30pm on 8 July 2003, the applicant and Lea-Caton drove in a vehicle to the Blaxland Fine Wine Cellars on the Great Western Highway at Blaxland. They entered the store. Lea-Caton was armed with a shortened .22 calibre rifle. The victim, Mr Penrose, was ordered at gunpoint to open the register. The applicant walked behind the service counter and took the cash tray from one register and four cartons of cigarettes, while Lea-Caton took notes from a second cash register. In total $1,000 was stolen. They left in the get-away vehicle. Those facts constitute count four. 
     
      
    13 As the applicant and his co-offender were leaving the Toongabbie Newsagency a customer was robbed of his mobile telephone. 
     
      
    14 This was the third offence on the second Form 1. 
     
      
    15 The other two robberies taken into account on that form were again committed by the applicant in the company of Lea-Caton. 
     
      
    16 On 3 July 2003 they entered a newsagency at Concord armed with a shortened .22 calibre rifle. A staff member was forced to hand over contents of a cash register amounting to $600 and a customer to hand over his wallet and its contents.  
     
      
    17 The first Form 1 admitted offences committed on 30 December 2000 at premises in Seven Hills known as Best Street Take-Away. They consisted of three charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on three separate victims, possession of a prohibited weapon, being a replica pistol, and being armed with that pistol with intent to commit an indictable offence specified as an assault. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was born on 24 April 1975. He has a considerable criminal record commencing in the Children’s Court. It is not necessary to pause to detail it.  
     
      
    19 At the time of these offences, with the exception of those on the first Form 1, he was on conditional liberty in connection with a conviction for arson in Rockhampton, Queensland in 2002.  
     
      
    20 The applicant’s personal background shows the manifestation of problems from an early age. He was adopted as an infant and her Honour noted his adoptive mother, in a true sense his mother, is supporting him as far as she can and was present at the sentence hearing.  
     
      
    21 He had attention deficit disorder identified while he was at school and he was taking drugs at an early age. A psychological report was tendered and its contents have been noted.  
     
      
    22 Four grounds of appeal have been filed and they are expressed in these terms:  
     
      
      1. The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      2. The sentence imposed in relation to count 2 is manifestly excessive. 
       
      3. The sentencing Judge erred in her approach to the matters on the Form 1.  
       
      4. The sentencing Judge gave insufficient weight to, or failed to give effect to, her findings relating to the mitigating features of the case and in particular to her findings in relation to (i) contrition, (ii) the lack of substantial harm to the victims and (iii) the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.  
       
      
    23 Grounds 1 and 2, imposed in the light of the structure of sentences which I have set out, attack the enveloping term of fifteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years nine months imposed on count two. I recognise that her Honour referred to the “principles of totality” in accordance with the dictate of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and said that the sentences would be partly cumulative. In fact, as I pointed out, they are effectively wholly concurrent. Although a verb of command appeared in the joint judgment in Pearce at page 624, it is to be understood in light of the later decision in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 which noted at page 624 that while Pearce and also Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 articulate commended courses, neither absolutely commands.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion the issue for this court is whether a total sentence which emerged in these circumstances as fifteen years imprisonment with eight years nine months non parole period from the structure which her Honour used was excessive in the sense that it lay beyond the limits of discretion. 
     
      
    25 Ground 3 conveys an underlying assumption that the marked elevation of the sentence on count two when compared with counts one, three and four was the result of misapplication of the approach to the three further robberies comprehended in the second Form 1. It is complained that her Honour made neither specific reference to the guideline judgment: Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, nor to the principles extracted therefrom. 
     
      
    26 Remarks on sentence have primary purposes of informing a prisoner why he or she is receiving an assessed sentence and exposing the reasons for making that assessment. Whilst my powers of observation do not prevent me from perceiving that many judges feel impelled on occasions to embroider their remarks with case references, quotations therefrom and elaborations upon sentencing principles, I consider that remarks on sentence which fulfil the primary purposes are beyond criticism and I reject the implication that an unembroidered approach is revelatory in some way of error.  
     
      
    27 As I have said, the issue for this Court is the total sentence and I would reject the assertion that there is implicit error of some sort.  
     
      
    28 The fourth ground, as its expression acknowledges, complains of matters of weight. Her Honour recounted significant matters of the applicant’s background, including his drug and gambling problems. She noted his expression of contrition and a letter received in evidence concerning remorse.  
     
      
    29 It is true that no victim was physically harmed, but there were multiple victims and their statements show their experiences were not without personal detrimental effect in almost every case. It was correct to observe that the safety of many innocent victims was threatened. 
     
      
    30 I do not accept that the learned Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. The evidence showed, as the Crown pointed out, that these offences were committed as the applicant breached conditional liberty for a third time. 
     
      
    31 The proportion between non parole period and total term was significantly varied in the applicant’s favour from that specified in the statute for the express purpose of allowing an extended, and I would say very extended, period of supervised rehabilitation. I detect no error in her Honour’s weighing of mitigatory circumstances.  
     
      
    32 I return to the enveloping sentence. It was assessed after a discount of twenty five percent for the plea of guilty. Lesser assessments of every count became in a practical sense irrelevant as the sentences on these counts were wholly subsumed within the non-parole period specified for count two. 
     
      
    33 In this instance the criminality of the applicant comprised four charged counts of aggravated armed robbery and three counts of robbery on the second Form 1, as well as what it must be conceded to have been an older offence on the first Form 1.  
     
      
    34 Save one day, the enveloping sentence also subsumed the sentences received by the applicant at Port Macquarie. I consider the enveloping sentence comfortably within the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    35 I acknowledge the reference by counsel to the collated statistics, but these are of little assistance when, for the reasons which I have indicated, it is appropriate to view in this case what her Honour assessed in terms of effective totality.  
     
      
    36 Senior Counsel for the applicant took the Court to a number of cases for comparative purposes. Those cases, and the statistics may be taken to have been in a similar situation, involved conventional assessments in accordance with what is now described as the commended approach of Pearce.  
     
      
    37 The reasons which I have given indicate that this is a case in which the criminality was in practical terms reflected entirely by the sentence imposed on count two. 
     
      
    38 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    39 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    40 WHEALY J: I agree. 
     
      
       
        
        (Mr Hamill made application that the order of the Court be that the application for leave to appeal be refused). 
        
       
      
    41 GROVE J: In lieu of the order which I have proposed, the order of the Court will be that leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

     Judgment 
      
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Geraghty DCJ at Penrith District Court. The applicant was committed for sentence from the Local Court following pleas of guilty to counts of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, for which a prescribed maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment was applicable, and an ongoing supply of prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, for which imprisonment for twenty years and possible fine is prescribed.  
     
      
    2 His Honour was asked to take into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure a further eleven charges. These consisted of seven further offences of supplying methylamphetamine which took place between 10 July and 5 November 2003, possessing a shortened firearm, possessing ammunition and not keeping a firearm safe, on 3 July 2003, and possession of cannabis on 3 July 2003.  
     
      
    3 It should be noted that the Form 1 signed by the applicant has what would appear to be typing errors in that the stated date of the offences of not keeping the firearm safe and possession of prohibited drug, cannabis, is 3 July 2004 whereas it should read and be taken to read 3 July 2003.  
     
      
    4 It is conceivable, I would say likely, that this mistake is the source of an erroneous observation by his Honour upon which reliance is placed by the applicant in support of his challenge to sentence. There is not any apparent connection, in a relevant sense, between the two principal offences charged. The facts were placed before the sentencing court in an agreed statement.  
     
      
    5 Senior counsel for the applicant has, with his usual candour, acknowledged that the seriousness of the offending is not disputed.  
     
      
    6 The first count had its origin on 22 June 2003 when the applicant sought the assistance of one Coleman whose motor vehicle he wished to use in the commission of the robbery of the payroll of a particular business. On 25 June Coleman reported the plan to police. An authority was granted for conducting a controlled operation. Surveillance was undertaken and eventually, on 3 July 2003, Coleman and the applicant set off with a bag and shortened rifle which the applicant had placed in the boot of the vehicle.  
     
      
    7 The journey was, however, interrupted by the car being stopped by some police who were then unaware of the controlled operation. Those police were contacted and the applicant and Coleman permitted to proceed. However, the applicant, at least for that day, abandoned the plan and returned home.  
     
      
    8 In the afternoon of 3 July a search warrant was executed at the applicant’s residence. He was arrested and interviewed. He denied relevant knowledge but was charged with the offences of possession of a shortened firearm, not keeping it safe, possession of ammunition and possession of the cannabis.  
     
      
    9 Released to bail, the applicant committed the first offence on the Form 1 of supplying methylamphetamine on 10 July 2003. On that day a person was arrested, after leaving the applicant’s residence, for having possession of two grams of methylamphetamine. He was interviewed and later, on 13 August 2003, authority was given for a controlled operation whereby a police undercover operative, referred to as Ben, would seek to purchase illicit drugs from the applicant and/or his partner Dorothy Jones.  
     
      
    10 On 26 September, 8 October and 20 October, 2003 Ben paid the applicant cash in the amount of $1,100 on each occasion. Upon receipt of these payments, the applicant left Ben and, on return, supplied various amounts of methylamphetamine. These are the supplies which are within the span of 30 days constituting the offence of ongoing supply charged in the second count. 
     
      
    11 The Form 1 includes admissions of supplying amounts up to 5 November 2003. It happens that on that date Ben handed the applicant $1,150 and received in return, after a short absence of the applicant, 25 grams of methylamphetamine. The police arrested the applicant and he has been in custody since that date. He was found to have $550 in his possession which led to the conclusion that he was buying the supply from someone else and making a profit of one hundred percent for the on selling, or looked at another way, splitting fifty/fifty with the supplier to him.  
     
      
    12 Judge Geraghty sentenced the applicant on the first count of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence with a sentence to imprisonment for two years six months, commencing on 5 November 2003, with a non parole period of two years from that date. That non parole period therefore expired on 4 November 2005.  
     
      
    13 Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the applicant on count two to imprisonment for five years commencing on 9 December 2004, with a non parole period of four years commencing on that day which will expire on 8 December 2008. This constituted an overall effective sentence to imprisonment for six years, one month and three days, with a non parole period of five years, one month and three days. 
     
      
    14 What might appear, prima facie, as a somewhat curious result is explained when it is observed that the learned judge imposed the sentence on 9 December 2004 and determined that the “custody already for thirteen months” - in fact, thirteen months and four days - was sufficient cumulative effect for the first and second counts. This seemingly advantaged the applicant in that it followed rejection of a Crown submission that the discrete offences should be met by wholly cumulative impositions.  
     
      
    15 It cannot be known what assessment his Honour might have made if he had accepted the Crown submission, but on that assessment there would have been terms to be entirely cumulative but he would also have needed to turn his mind to totality.  
     
      
    16 The applicant argues three contentions of identifiable specific error. The first is a factual error referable, one would be minded to think, to his Honour having been misled by the wrong year date specified in respect of the eleventh charge on the Form 1. Twice in his remarks on sentence he referred to the supply of methylamphetamine as being over a period of a year. At one point he mentioned 10 July 2003 to 3 July 2004. As I have mentioned, the latter date was erroneously endorsed on the Form 1.  
     
      
    17 The date of charge numbered eleven, which in fact concerned possession of cannabis rather than methylamphetamine, it is agreed by the parties, should be 3 July 2003.  
     
      
    18 The span of time of methylamphetamine supply extended over a period from 10 July 2003 until the arrest on 5 November 2003. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the three occasions which I have specified in order to constitute the offence charged and take into account the other matters on the Form 1 when one comes to sentence. This maybe an awkward approach but it is recognised that that is requisite in the light of legislative requirements.  
     
      
    19 The second error is focused upon the explicit taking into account of what his Honour correctly described as the applicant’s extensive and significant record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor as he sought to apply provisions in section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Such an error has been so often identified in other cases that I need not pause to, once again, describe how it comes about.  
     
      
    20 It suffices to record reference to R v Williams [2004] NSWCCA 76 and R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78.  
     
      
    21 The third ground is sought to be supported by reference to the arithmetical calculation of proportion of non parole period to total sentence. The non parole period represents 83.5 percent of the total term. The thrust of the submission is that the period of potentially twelve months parole after service of over five years in custody is an insufficient appropriate period for supervised release.  
     
      
    22 It is accepted that his Honour found no special circumstances for which there should be an adjustment of proportion in favour of the applicant and that finding is not challenged. However, neither did his Honour expressly advert to the consequence that his imprisonment resulted in a proportion to the disadvantage of the applicant which exceeded the statutory formula.  
     
      
    23 The identification of error does not, of itself, give rise to necessary intervention by this Court. The situation was the subject of reminder by the Chief Justice in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at page 720 when he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows:  
         
          
         
         ‘If it is of the opinion that error 
         
         has occurred in the sentencing process’. 
         
         
        That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that 
         
         
         ‘some other sentence …. is warranted in law 
         
         and should have been passed’.  
        
       
       
        
        Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’ is not satisfied”.  
        
       
       
      
    24 The essential question, as I see it, is whether in this case the pre-condition has been fulfilled. The error of fact concerning the span of time revealed in his Honour’s statement is not one which I consider should attract the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    25 It is noteworthy that there is no claimed error in the perception of the number of individual dealings actually involved.  
     
      
    26 Neither would I propose intervention in connection with the description of the prior record of the applicant as a matter of aggravation. Although I would not conclude that retribution, deterrence and protection of society required a severer sentence, as submitted by the Crown in, for example, R v Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, I do not perceive that, allowing that the prior record would inhibit claims to leniency, his Honour’s assessments are outside the range of sound discretionary exercise. 
     
      
    27 However, his Honour assessed the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as poor and that was a finding clearly open on the material. Nevertheless, he did not appear to make any assessment of the appropriate period which might reflect the applicant succeeding in undertaking a lawful life when returned to society.  
     
      
    28 After full time imprisonment of about five years, a period of twelve months supervised parole, in my opinion, manifests inadequacy for that purpose. That period of twelve months emerged from the sentence on the supply offence being simply divided into four years minimum and one year parole which, independently of the partial accumulation, provides a custodial period of eight percent of the whole term.  
     
      
    29 I conclude that there should be an adjustment to bring the division into approximate line with the statutory proportion and thereby make available for the applicant greater opportunity for successful parole. I propose to round the figure slightly in favour of the applicant.  
     
      
    30 I propose the following orders 
     
      
       
      1. The application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and the appeal allowed in part. 
       
      2. The sentence for on going supply of prohibited drug is quashed, and in lieu thereof, taking into account the offences on Form 1, the applicant sentenced for that offence to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of three years five months, commencing on 9 December 2004 and expiring on 8 May 2008, and a non parole period of one year seven months, commencing on 9 May 2008.  
       
      The earliest date of eligibility for consideration of parole is specified as 9 May 2008.  
      
    31 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    32 WHEALY J: I agree. 
     
      
    33 GROVE J: The orders of the court will be, therefore, as I have proposed. In effect the release date comes back from December 2008 to May 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 STUDDERT J: The appellant, Mark Shane Skondin, appeals against his conviction for an offence of malicious wounding. Following conviction the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three years, which sentence has now been served. The appeal is an appeal against conviction only. 
     
      
    2 Denis Lovric (the victim) was stabbed and sustained multiple injuries involving his kidney, his spleen and his liver. The penetrating injury affected both sides of the victim’s stomach, both sides of his colon and his diaphragm. The stabbing occurred in Arthur Park, Kings Cross on the night of 12 October 2002. 
     
      
    3 The real issue at the appellant’s trial was whether or not he was the attacker. The victim identified the appellant as such and the Crown also relied upon a DVD surveillance recording movement at the doorway of a newsagency, in which recording the victim asserted, and the jury was invited to conclude, a person who appeared was the appellant. According to the victim, he entered that newsagency after meeting the appellant in the street and shortly before he was stabbed.  
     
      
    4 The appellant gave evidence at his trial to the effect that he knew the victim, but he did not stab him. He denied attending Arthur Park on the day in question. As to the DVD footage, he was unable to say whether he was shown in the footage or not. 
     
      
    5 Whilst the central issue at the trial was a narrow one, namely was the appellant the attacker, it is submitted that the trial miscarried for a number of reasons recorded in amended grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
       
      Ground 1: The trial miscarried 
       
      
    6 No discrete error is identified for the purposes of ground 1. Rather, it is submitted the trial miscarried by reason of errors identified in other grounds to which I now direct consideration. I propose to consider grounds 3-12 before returning to ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The judge erred in not discharging the jury after the Crown Prosecutor’s opening 
       
      
    7 The Crown, when opening the case, referred to the relationship between the victim and the appellant. He did so in the following passage which forms the basis of the first ground: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case as I expect it to be will be that the alleged victim in this matter, and his name is Denis Lovric, he is a self admitted drug user. Or was at the time of this offence I should say. He met the accused in 1999 in the Marrickville/Sydenham area and at the time he knew the accused as Skondo. He would meet up with the accused about three times a week in the Sydenham/Marrickville area  
        and they would purchase and use drugs together. 
         They ceased contact or they lost contact at the end of 1999.” (T 84) 
        
       
      
    8 Following the opening, counsel for the appellant complained about the reference to the appellant as a drug user. It was submitted that that reference created incurable prejudice and the trial judge was asked to discharge the jury. The judge declined to do so. 
     
      
    9 At the time that ruling was given, the Crown case as outlined was going to be that on the night of the offence the victim met the appellant at a time when the victim was in the company of a man named Troy Gilmour and that the three men each proceeded to purchase a cap of heroin from the same source. According to the victim, the three men used some of that drug prior to the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    10 The Crown has submitted that the extent of the relationship between the victim and the appellant was relevant as bearing upon the plausibility of the alleged meeting on the night of the offence and the allegation that the offender, the victim and Gilmour each purchased and used heroin before the wounding occurred. 
     
      
    11 In declining to discharge the jury, his Honour stated his reasons very shortly: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I understand it, the evidence is going to be that he is a drug addict and it does not seem to me that any prejudice is added to that by saying that he was a drug addict in 1999 as opposed to being a drug addict in 2002. So I refuse the application for a discharge.” 
        
       
      
    12 I am not persuaded that the decision to refuse the discharge application before the evidence began amounted to error in the exercise of the judge’s discretion, or that the decision then taken caused the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 The judge erred in not discharging the jury after the evidence of Mr Lovric 
       
      
    13 The victim was asked to describe the person he knew as “Skondo” in 1999 and proceeded (T 7, 16 October 2003) to give this description: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, medium build, sort of blondish/brown-ish hair, pointy nose, kind of ravaged by drug use pretty much.” 
        
       
      
    14 Neither before that description was given nor subsequently did the Crown seek to adduce from the victim evidence consistent with the opening that he met the appellant three times a week in 1999 and that they bought and used drugs together. 
     
      
    15 This is explicable having regard to what the trial judge said before Lovric commenced his evidence. Notwithstanding the ruling of the judge on the first discharge application, his Honour asked the Crown why it was necessary to introduce the issue of drug use by the appellant in 1999, and the Crown responded (T 2, 16 October 2003): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says it is probative because it goes to the identification of the accused by virtue of the victim’s relationship with who we say is the accused, knew him, and their relationship was a drug based one. They met up in Kings Cross for the purposely solely of using drugs together. So it links, on the Crown case, the accused, or the person we say is the accused, with the person that Mr Lovric knew in 1999. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh, I don’t think you need to do that. I think you can introduce the evidence of Lovric’s knowledge of the accused without referring to the accused’s drug taking…you will need to speak to Mr Lovric about that. You will have time to do that. But that raises the question then whether you really need to go into  
        Mr Lovric’s drug use 
         at all, I suppose.” 
        
       
      
    16 When counsel for the appellant complained about the description given by the victim as to the appellant’s drug ravaged appearance (T 26), the judge indicated that the description was unresponsive to the question asked but that he proposed to deal with the matter by giving a very firm direction to the jury concerning any potential prejudice about the accused being a drug user on the night in question “so as to avoid them using that as a basis for a finding of guilt.” Counsel for the accused complained that any direction would only emphasise it (T 27). 
     
      
    17 It is common ground that no direction was later given to the jury such as his Honour contemplated. Neither, however, did counsel for the appellant seek a direction and, presumably, this is because it was considered that a direction would not help but would only tend to emphasise the evidence about the introduction of the subject of complaint. 
     
      
    18 The evidence as to the alleged drug-ravaged appearance of the appellant ought not to have been given and it was, indeed, non-responsive. However, I am not persuaded that the trial judge was in error in refusing to discharge the jury when the description came out in the manner in which it did and since no complaint was made about the judge’s failure to address that piece of evidence in his summing-up, r 4 applies. I am not persuaded that a miscarriage resulted from the introduction of the evidence as to the appellant’s appearance, and, indeed, Mr Ramage did not contend that, viewed alone, it did so. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The trial judge erred in restricting and/or preventing cross examination 
       
      
    19 The only positive evidence identifying the appellant as the person who stabbed the victim came from the victim himself. Then there was the DVD recording which the victim said captured the image of the appellant. The victim’s companion, Mr Gilmour, did not identify the appellant as the victim’s attacker, and I will refer more closely to the evidence that deals with the issue of identification when I return to consider Ground 2.  
     
      
    20 However, before evidence was led in front of the jury, counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial, informed the trial judge that the nature of the police investigation would be in issue (T 32, 15 October 2003). Hence, in cross examination of police officers, counsel for the appellant sought to explore the question as to whether the police stopped making other inquiries once the victim named the appellant. 
     
      
    21 Against this background, it is submitted that the trial miscarried when the trial judge rejected questions asked of Inspector Fletcher and Det. Constable Morrison. Before either of officers was called, Mr Gilmour had given evidence that he was shown the DVD and that he had told the police and the Crown that the person with the backpack in the DVD was not the person who had stabbed the victim, and that he was 100 percent sure of that. He said that the person who stabbed the victim did not resemble the man with the backpack in the DVD. 
     
      
    22 Later, when Inspector Fletcher was called and gave evidence concerning the identification process in which the victim identified the photo of the appellant as being a photo of his assailant, counsel for the appellant, having been granted leave to further cross examine the inspector, asked this question (T 206, 22 October 2003): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Sir, in a situation where the identity of the suspect is a matter in question, is it the situation that you, as a matter of practice, would invite witnesses to the incident to view a presentation?” 
        
       
      
    23 The Inspector was then asked a series of questions in which the cross examiner endeavoured to elicit details of procedures of police investigations. The judge did not allow evidence as to this to be elicited (T 205-208). 
     
      
    24 Det. Constable Morrison was the witness next called after Inspector Fletcher. Det. Constable Morrison was the officer in charge of the investigation. She was asked in cross examination whether a statement was taken from a Mr Ruchman, who indicated that he had seen a person in the park. The police officer responded in the negative. Counsel then sought to cross examine the police officer as to whether inquiries had been made of Mr Ruchman. It did emerge in further cross examination that a police officer other than Constable Morrison has spoken to Mr Ruchman on the evening of 12 October and that he was not spoken to after that. 
     
      
    25 A reading of the cross examination of this police witness does not convey that the trial judge prevented the cross examiner from eliciting any admissible material concerning the person named as Mr Ruchman. 
     
      
    26 Then, the cross examiner sought to ask Det. Constable Morrison about what information Ms Woolbank (relevant to Grounds 6 and 7), gave as to the whereabouts of the appellant at the time of the stabbing. The judge refused such cross examination, and this was unquestionably a correct ruling. 
     
      
    27 The witness who was called immediately prior to Inspector Fletcher was Constable O’Leary. He attended Arthur Park shortly after the stabbing where he saw four people standing around the victim. He spoke to people in the vicinity. In cross examination he identified those persons. One of those persons was Mr Ruchman. He was cross examined about the course of his investigation that evening, which he said included speaking to Mr Ruchman, who, he agreed when this was put to him by counsel, appeared to be a homeless person sleeping in the bus shelter. 
     
      
    28 Having read the transcript concerning the cross examination of Inspector Fletcher and Det. Constable Morrison, I am of the opinion that there was no ruling in the course of that cross examination preventing the cross examiner from eliciting admissible and relevant evidence from either witness. Ground 5 fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The trial judge erred in failing to request or direct the calling of a witness 
       
       
      Ground 7: The judge erred in ruling that he would not permit evidence of alibi to be called 
       
      
    29 It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. Each of these two grounds involves the person Monique Woolbank. 
     
      
    30 Monique Woolbank is the cousin of the appellant, and a statement was taken from her by the police on 29 October 2002. According to her, the appellant was known to her as “Skondo” and the statement recorded in a police notebook contained these paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 27th September 2002 my cousin, Shane Skondin, whose date of birth is 10/5/1972 got out of gaol. He came and saw me and I said he could come and stay with me. He came back that night with his gaol stuff. The next day he picked up some bags from his grandmother’s place with his clothes. He put those in the spare room at my place. Up until Shane got locked up at Sutherland on 14 October ’02, he was staying with me.  
        
       
       
        
        He used to go and visit Natasha Maher from Coogee and also Rebecca Grey at Redfern. When Shane got arrested by police at Sutherland he had stayed at my house almost every night for the previous week.” 
        
       
      
    31 A copy of that statement was served with the Crown brief and it did not express an alibi, although it certainly invited inquiry of Ms Woolbank on behalf of the appellant as to whether she was in a position to afford the appellant an alibi. However, nothing was done to address this issue before the appellant’s trial began. No notice of alibi was given prior to the trial, and although Ms Woolbank was present at court during the trial, she was not called to give evidence. For the purposes of these two grounds it is necessary to understand why she did not enter the witness box. 
     
      
    32 Affidavit evidence was introduced on the hearing of this appeal from the Crown Prosecutor and from trial counsel for the appellant. There is some conflict in the evidence from these sources as to what happened concerning this witness after the trial began. Prior to the commencement of the evidence, the jury had been alerted concerning the possibility that that witness would be called or, at least, to the possibility that her name might be mentioned in the course of the evidence. However, according to the prosecutor, once it became apparent at the commencement of the trial that the appellant did not dispute his prior association with the victim, a decision was made by the prosecutor that Ms Woolbank’s evidence was not required. The Crown had apparently earlier perceived that it would have been desirable to have her evidence that the appellant was called “Skondo”, affording some support for the victim’s assertion that he had known “Skondo” since 1999. 
     
      
    33 This trial began on Wednesday 15 October 2003. The summing up began on Thursday 23 October, and the jury returned with its verdict on Friday 24 October 2003. Prior to the close of the case for the prosecution, the prosecutor informed trial counsel for the appellant that it was not proposed to call Ms Woolbank. It appears that that advice was given on the morning of Wednesday 22 October. On the previous Friday trial counsel for the appellant had interviewed Ms Woolbank and in the course of that interview Ms Woolbank stated that the appellant had stayed at her home from 27 September 2002 to 14 October 2002.  
     
      
    34 Summarising what Ms Woolbank told counsel on 17 October 2002, the appellant lost his key to her flat early in his stay and Ms Woolbank declined to give him a replacement key. Instead, she required him to be home by 8.00 pm to 9.00 pm at night. Ms Woolbank had recently had a baby, and she did not wish him disturbing her after 9.00 pm by ringing the buzzer to gain entry to the flat. 
     
      
    35 Ms Woolbank did not then directly assert that the appellant was at home with her on the night of the stabbing but when the Crown Prosecutor approached the witness at court on the morning of 22 October 2003 and advised her that she was not required as a witness, Ms Woolbank told the prosecutor that she had informed trial counsel for the appellant that the appellant was at home with her on the night of the stabbing. The prosecutor then repeated this to the appellant’s counsel. 
     
      
    36 At this stage in the proceedings, no notice of alibi had been given. 
     
      
    37 I have set out this history of events in some detail because it affords the background to what led up to the rulings giving rise to these two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    38 On 22 October 2003, trial counsel for the appellant, proceeded to assert in front of the jury: “The Crown’s aware of an alibi that this witness has and the Crown has chosen not to call her [Ms Woolbank]” (T 241). This was an inappropriate comment. 
     
      
    39 The following exchange then occurred (T 243): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Has notice been given of an alibi? 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: No your Honour, I didn’t know anything about it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: How can you have the effrontery to say that in front of the jury that the Crown is aware of an alibi. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Because the Crown informed me this morning that they would not be calling Ms Woolbank. She was a witness that was proposed to be called by the Crown and attended here pursuant to a request of the Crown to give evidence. The Crown informed me-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: [Counsel] you know the rules about alibi. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, this is a very different situation. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Why did you raise the question of alibi in front of the jury when you have not given notice of alibi 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I was not going to take the witness to that material. I was trying to indicate the relevance of it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: [Counsel]-- 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: The material as to the investigation-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: [Counsel]-- 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: -- and the whole way in which the police have approached this matter has been something that has not been a situation that has been fair and appropriate to the accused. The Crown were aware of this witness and have chosen not to call her. 
        
       
       
        
        It is material that was anticipated in the Crown case. It’s the Crown’s evidence that the Crown has decided not to call. It’s not the accused’s evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: [Counsel], if you want to abide by the rules you have got to give notice. You haven’t given notice. The Crown is not therefore on notice of any alibi. The Crown is not obliged to call witnesses it doesn’t wish to call. You know that. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: This is an Apostolidis situation. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You haven’t raised an Apostolidis situation…” 
        
       
      
    40 Then (at T 245-247): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: [Counsel] tell me what your application is? 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: That the evidence of Ms Woolbank will be admitted. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You can call her if you want to. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: She is relevant and appropriate and gives evidence pertinent to the allegations in the Crown case 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That doesn’t-- 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: The Crown case opened that they would call her. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That does not prevent you from calling her. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: It doesn’t prevent me, but it is appropriate that the Crown calls the appropriate witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You know that I can’t ask the Crown to call her, if that’s what you’re asking me to do. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I am not asking your Honour to force the Crown to, but I am indicating to your Honour that pursuant to Apostolidis that this evidence is within the parameters of the Crown-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It’s no good. If you make the application to tell the Crown to call her you know that I can’t do that. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I think your Honour can tell the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is that what you’re asking me to do? You are asking me to order the Crown to call Ms Woolbank. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Let me read this very carefully. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honour needs me to -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- Just let me read it very carefully first of all. I have read that; [counsel] there is absolutely no basis in that statement upon which I could possibly take the drastic step of ordering the Crown to call that witness. If in fact I had any such power and it certainly not a situation where I would cause the calling of Ms Woolbank myself, so your application is refused. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Further, I don’t wish to cavil with your Honour’s ruling, but-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Good. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: -- But I will indicate to your Honour that the statement, there is additional material to the statement, that being that Ms Woolbank would say, as I understand it, that on 12 October that she was at home with her child and that the accused was at home with her. And I perused the material, in the expectation as I have been informed by the Crown, that that would be the evidence that she would give. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Let’s be clear. Apparently this is what Ms Woolbank told [counsel] last week and that I was informed of this morning. If the basis of the application is to in fact call the alibi evidence, which appears to be the first application that should be made, if your Honour which the Crown would oppose because it doesn’t accord with the legislation, if your Honour did allow the adducing of alibi evidence then the Crown would call her, but based on the evidence given in the statement by Ms Woolbank last year there is nothing material in that statement to this case.” 
        
       
      
    41 The judge correctly informed counsel that he was not prepared to allow cross examination of Constable Morrison as to evidence that Ms Woolbank might be able to give. Thereafter counsel for the appellant sought a ruling on the admissibility of alibi evidence and the Crown indicated its opposition (at T 248): 
     
      
       
        
        “[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honour should rule about on the question of the admissibility of the alibi. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: We haven’t got to your case yet. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honour it is appropriate and I appreciate that notice has not been given until now at this point in time. But it is still within the Crown case and, as I understand it, any material to be led by the Crown contradicting any alibi needs to be done during the Crown case. And if I am to be permitted to lead evidence about it, then the fact is that your Honour has to provide leave in these circumstances for the evidence to be called. And being still in the Crown case it would be appropriate for any case in reply so far as the material concerned to be led in the Crown case. So in my respectful submission it is appropriate for your Honour to deal with the admissibility of any alibi question now. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What do you say Madam Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, your Honour, the Crown having not been provided with the notice of the alibi in accordance with the Criminal Procedures Act that being 21 days before the date when the trial date was set, the Crown would oppose the leading of the alibi evidence. And it is not as though it is something that would not have come to the attention of the accused certainly back when notice was required to be served. 
        
       
       
        
        [TRIAL COUNSEL]: That is because it was indicated to be a Crown witness…” 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour treated what had occurred as being an application by counsel for leave to adduce evidence in support of an alibi. His Honour refused leave for the proposed alibi evidence to be given, and in the course of his reasons identified the grounds of his refusal: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is common ground that notice of the alibi in accordance with the statutory requirements was not given. The reasons given for the defence not giving that notice are: firstly that the accused himself has no idea where he was on that night; and secondly that the precise evidence of Ms Woolbank as to the alibi did not become available until during the course of this trial. It is also put that there is no prejudice to the Crown in the evidence now being called because no further investigation by the police could, or would have been possible. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the latter I am entirely unconvinced. It may be in certain cases that further investigation by the police will not reveal any further material. But I am of the view that in this case further investigations may have been possible by the police both in the form of further questioning of Ms Woolbank and in the form of questioning of others, and in particular, neighbours of Ms Woolbank, and in fact other people as well, depending upon answers received to further questioning of those people. 
        
       
       
        
        However, the telling aspect, in my view, in respect of this application is that nothing was done in response to the serving of the statement of Ms Woolbank. The defence was on notice from an early stage that Ms Woolbank would say that the accused had stayed at her house almost every night for the week previous to 14th of October 2002. It was a simple step from there to ask her whether she had any recollection as to the night of the 12th of October 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        That should have been done if there was any intention to rely upon an alibi of the nature that is now proposed. And the fact that it was not done, and that the proposed evidentiary material emerges only now during the course of the case, combined with the possible prejudice to the Crown, is in my view fatal to the application. Accordingly I refuse leave for the proposed alibi evidence now to be called.” 
        
       
      
    43 In short, his Honour took the view that since the appellant was aware from 2002 that Ms Woolbank would say he was staying with her at the relevant time, there was ample opportunity well before the trial for the appellant to have ascertained from Ms Woolbank that she could afford evidence of an alibi. In my opinion, the judge was correct to so conclude. 
     
      
    44 It is the second reason given by the judge which leads me to conclude that the exercise of judicial discretion miscarried. The Crown did not advance any specific evidence of prejudice. It did not refer to opportunities for investigation that had been lost. 
     
      
    45 In order to introduce the evidence in support of an alibi, the appellant was required by s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act to give notice “before the end of the prescribed period”: s 150(2). The “prescribed period” was defined in s 150 as meaning “the period commencing at the time of the accused person’s committal for trial and ending twenty-one days before the trial is listed for hearing”: s 150(8). 
     
      
    46 Had the appellant given the prescribed notice twenty-one days before the trial was listed for hearing, leave to introduce evidence of the alibi would not have been required. Whatever investigations that could have been taken by the Crown twenty-one days before the trial could presumably have been taken during the trial, had leave been granted, without significant disruption of the trial. Ms Woolbank was certainly available for questioning, and the Crown did not assert there was any particular avenue of inquiry that had been lost to it. 
     
      
    47 A court should be slow to refuse a leave application under s 150(2) unless prejudice arises such as is incapable of being addressed without significant disruption of the trial. In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case the judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in refusing leave to introduce evidence of alibi. 
     
      
    48 Ground 7 has been established. 
     
      
    49 Ground 6, however, has not been established. The application made to the judge, as the extract of the transcript set out above discloses, was an application that the judge direct the Crown to call the witness, Ms Woolbank. It was not for the judge to direct the Crown to call Ms Woolbank, and his Honour made no error in declining the application to do so: see The Queen v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563. 
     
      
    50 The significance of the ruling concerning alibi evidence is to be assessed by reference to what has been referred to in the amended grounds of appeal as  
     
      
       
      Ground 12: “Fresh evidence”. 
       
      
    51 This Court was asked to receive evidence from Monique Woolbank and from her de facto husband, Theo Mouhtaris. 
     
      
    52 Monique Woolbank made an affidavit on 17 August 2005 and was cross examined before this Court. Her evidence was that the appellant went to stay with her in her flat on 27 September 2002 and that he stayed with her until his arrest after the date of the stabbing. He had no key to the flat and, according to the witness, could only gain access to the flat when she let him in. Her child was born on 13 August 2002. The witness said she was at home at night and in bed by 8.00 pm or 9.00 pm at the latest. The appellant did not use the buzzer to gain access at night. Moreover, according to Ms Woolbank, the appellant was on crutches and injured his hand, and, according to Ms Woolbank, did not go out at night after 8.00 pm after he was injured. There were medical records introduced into evidence which supported the assertion that the appellant suffered injury in early October, certainly before 12 October. These records included an x-ray report of 6 October 2002 which showed that the appellant had a fracture of the proximal fifth metacarpal shaft in the right hand and at that time x-rays were taken of the left ankle, although they showed no abnormality. 
     
      
    53 According to Ms Woolbank, Theo Mouhtaris was living in the flat off and on in October 2002 and he had a key. The cross examination of Ms Woolbank gave rise to the possibility that Theo Mouhtaris could have let the appellant into the flat whilst Ms Woolbank was sleeping, or have lent his key to the appellant. 
     
      
    54 However, Theo Mouhtaris was called to give evidence. He said he never provided the appellant with the key to Ms Woolbank’s unit. 
     
      
    55 In my opinion, the evidence introduced in this Court and reviewed above is capable of belief. The evidence of the appellant at trial was that he was not with the victim on the night that the victim was stabbed, and the alibi evidence which Ms Woolbank could have given would have supported the appellant’s case. It seems to me that there exists a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellant had the evidence which this Court has heard been introduced before it. I reach that conclusion having regard to the evidence I will review when shortly considering Ground 2. 
     
      
    56 It seems to me therefore that there has been a miscarriage of justice at the trial by reason of the refusal of the judge to permit the introduction of the alibi evidence. Hence, the conviction ought not be permitted to stand. Notwithstanding this conclusion, I will address the other grounds of appeal presented. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: The trial judge unduly interfered in the conduct of the trial 
       
      
    57 It was submitted that the trial judge rejected cross examination peremptorily, and that his Honour’s approach disrupted the trial and unduly inhibited counsel for the appellant, and was likely to have adversely affected the accused. A schedule of interruptions and comments by the judge was presented in the course of the hearing of the appeal. I do not propose to review the transcript references exhaustively and, indeed, little time was spent in this appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    58 Suffice it to say that having read those passages of the transcript in the schedule that Mr Ramage presented, I am not persuaded that the intervention of the judge caused the trial to miscarry. Ground 8 has not been established. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9: The judge erred in directing the jury to disregard submissions of defence counsel 
       
       
      Ground 10: The judge erred in directing the jury that they were not to consider another person other than the accused was responsible for the stabbing 
       
      
    59 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together.  
     
      
    60 Complaint is made concerning the following direction in the summing up (SU 13, 23 October 2003): 
     
      
       
        
        “Some attention was given by [counsel] to what she variously described as an unsatisfactory or as a deficient police investigation. Quite frankly, I have to direct you to disregard those submissions in so far as they refer to a deficient police investigation. It is a complete red herring and by that I mean that it would be distraction from your proper task in this case if you were to pay any attention to deciding whether there had been a deficient police investigation or not, in so far as there is material which has been put before you on what the police did not do or fail to do, or failed to follow up, questions that they did not ask people, that they did not interview, that kind of thing.” 
        
       
      
    61 The complaint is made that the proper course would have been for the judge to have raised the matter with counsel in the absence of the jury and to have invited her to withdraw or modify her submissions. 
     
      
    62 The directions above set out were immediately followed by these further directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “I direct you as a matter of law that that material is not to be used by you as any evidence that any other person was responsible for the stabbing of Mr Lovric or that there was a reasonable possibility that any other person was responsible. As I say, it would be a complete distraction from your proper task to start to consider whether there had been a sufficient or a deficient police investigation.  
        Your proper task is to decide on the evidence placed before you whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed this offence 
        .” 
        
       
      
    63 The instruction to which emphasis has been given in the passage above properly directed the jury to consider the real issue, and to my mind there is no substance in Ground 9 or Ground 10. 
     
      
       
      Ground 11: The trial judge erred in failing to refer to the evidence given by the accused 
       
      
    64 The evidence in chief which the appellant gave was extremely brief. He told the jury (T 258) he had met the victim a couple of times in 1999 but that he never stabbed him. He denied they had heroin together on 12 October 2002 and he denied that he was ever at Arthur Park with the victim or with the witness Gilmour. He denied meeting Gilmour before appearing at court. 
     
      
    65 Early in the summing up, the judge reminded the jury (SU 13) that the appellant said he did not stab the victim. He later reminded the jury of that evidence (see later SU 3). The central issue was a narrow one and the appellant’s evidence about it was brief. No further direction relevant to this ground was sought at the trial. It seems to me that the summing up sufficiently reminded the jury of the issues that it had to address, such as were addressed in the appellant’s evidence. 
     
      
    66 This ground has not been established. In the absence of any relevant complaint r 4 applies and I would refuse leave to rely upon the ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The verdict was unreasonable 
       
      
    67 This ground involves consideration as to whether it was open to the jury on the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. 
     
      
    68 The Crown case depended essentially upon the jury accepting the victim as a truthful and a reliable witness. He had consumed heroin shortly before the stabbing. He had been spoken to by the police on 25 October 2002. The victim described his attacker as “Skondo” and then said that he had thin, blond scruffy hair “which hangs just above his shoulders”. He said he was wearing a light coloured T-shirt and black shorts. This differed from the description that he gave in his evidence in chief (T 17, 16 October 2003). In court he said he had  
     
      
       
        
        “short hair and scruffy clothes, a white shirt and a black sort-of jacket, jumper over them. He had shorts on and scabby shoes and a backpack.” 
        
       
      
    69 Of course, as far as the victim was concerned, he claimed to have an acquaintance with the appellant in 1999, so that he knew him prior to the date of the attack. The appellant acknowledged some acquaintance with the victim in 1999. 
     
      
    70 The victim said that following the stabbing he was unconscious for some days but was then interviewed in hospital by Det. Constable Morrison. He said he was reluctant to name his attacker but he did so after a few minutes. In cross examination he agreed that he supplied a description to police on 25 October 2002 but he said he had indicated prior to that date that “Skondo” was the person responsible (T 74). The victim’s evidence found support in the evidence of Constable Morrison who said that she interviewed the victim in hospital on 17 October 2002 and, having done so, returned to the Kings Cross detectives’ office and made inquiries in an attempt to locate a person by the name of “Skondin” (T 216). This evidence invites the inference that the victim named the appellant as his attacker on the occasion of his first interview in hospital. 
     
      
    71 The victim identified the appellant as a person shown in the newsagency security footage. 
     
      
    72 There was, of course, evidence from other sources which was inconsistent with the evidence of the victim, including the evidence of Mr Gilmour. 
     
      
    73 Mr Gilmour described the victim’s attacker as  
     
      
       
        
        “Caucasian, 160 centimetres in height, of medium height, carrying a yellow and black backpack, forty or fifty years of age, wearing a flannelette shirt and carrying a big silver knife with a serrated blade.” 
        
       
      
    74 That description was given to Constable Glasson within a very short time of the stabbing (T 162). 
     
      
    75 Mr Gilmour gave a different description at trial, saying the attacker  
     
      
       
        
        “was bald on top, with grey hair around the edges, and flat nose like he had been hit heaps of times. He looked like a bum, with a grey flannelette shirt, dirty jeans and that.” (T 99). 
        
       
      
    76 When shown the newsagency security footage, he said that the person pointed out was not the attacker and that the person on the video did not even resemble the attacker (T 125-126). 
     
      
    77 Mr Kirchengast gave evidence of crossing through the park where the victim was attacked, and of noticing three men sitting in a triangle. Two were in their mid twenties with short hair, and the third man looked to be over thirty years of age and to be scruffier and more unkempt than the other two. That third person had brown hair, a light coloured or white shirt and shorts and socks and shoes. He had a bigger build than the other two men. 
     
      
    78 Another witness, Mr Zordan, also passed the park and saw three men, two of whom were younger than the third. He saw they were “fitting up”. The third man was distinctly different to the younger guys in that “[he] was older, he was scruffier looking, he had a beard, and he was thinner and he looked unkempt.” He could not recall what he was wearing. 
     
      
    79 Mr Tomasich came upon the victim after he had been stabbed. He was leaning on the back of a car. He told Mr Tomasich he had been stabbed. He pleaded with Mr Tomasich to “take him away from this man”. Mr Tomasich saw a tall man, about six foot, very well built, very well groomed, carrying a dog. However, Mr Tomasich observed that it was apparent that that person had not been the victim’s attacker, and he concluded the attacker had already left the scene. 
     
      
    80 The descriptions given by Mr Gilmour, Mr Kirchengast and Mr Zordan did not assist the Crown. The prosecution case was by no means an overwhelming one, depending as it did essentially upon the acceptance of the victim’s evidence, notwithstanding the different descriptions he had given of his assailant, together with such support as the jury perceived the security camera footage afforded. The Court has seen that footage. 
     
      
    81 Having considered the evidence before the jury, including the camera footage, I have concluded that it was open to the jury on that evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant, and Ground 2 fails. 
     
      
    82 I have, however, already expressed my opinion as to the alibi evidence which the jury did not have the opportunity of considering, and its possible effect had the jury had such evidence before it. 
     
      
    83 In summary then, I am of the opinion that this appeal should succeed. The appellant has now served the fixed term sentence that was imposed, in its entirety. In R v Hasenkamp (unreported, NSWCCA, 24 February 1998) Grove J referred to the “longstanding practice of the court not to exercise [the] discretion to order a new trial where the sentence imposed as a result of the quashed conviction has been served”. In that case, by majority, it was determined since almost all of the minimum term of a sentence had been served that there should be no order for a new trial. It seems to me in the circumstances that a like approach should be adopted here. 
     
      
    84 Hence, I would allow the appeal and propose that the verdict of guilty be quashed absolutely and that no new trial be ordered. 
     
      
    85 WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Studdert J and the orders that he proposes. 
     
      
    86 HOWIE J: I agree with Studdert J.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 LATHAM J: On 5 September 2005, each of the offenders, Steven Charles Smit, Shiree Anne Smit and Donna Claire Tarrant were found guilty by a jury of the charge of murder. The victim of the offence, Craig Patrick Collins, was known to all three offenders. Donna Tarrant shared the premises at 80 Camp Street Katoomba with the victim. Steven Smit and Shiree Smit, who are husband and wife, also lived in Katoomba and knew Mr Collins as a regular patron of various local hotels, where they also regularly consumed alcohol. The offenders were together with Mr Collins at the Camp Street premises in the evening of 28 August 2001. 
     
      
    2 Mr Collins’ body was found on Thursday 30 August 2001 in the kitchen of his premises. The body was naked and had been wrapped in two blankets, along with a cricket bat and a number of articles of clothing. The principal cause of death was blunt trauma to the neck which had resulted in a fracture of the voice box and subsequent suffocation. Abrasions to both sides of the neck were consistent with the edge of the cricket bat having struck the voice box with considerable force. In addition, there were two stab wounds to the back of the head, at the base of the skull, which were fairly shallow in nature. There was a stab wound to the right side of the front of the chest, approximately two centimetres long. That wound penetrated through to the wall of the rib cage and sustained minor damage to the right lung. There were also a number of stab wounds on the back of the body, including five on the lower part of the left-hand side of the back just above the buttock and two to the right side of the back. One of the wounds on the left-hand side of the back above the buttock area penetrated the pelvic area and damaged a large vein in that region. A fairly extensive amount of bruising and abrasions were located on the legs, on the arms and hand and on the front and back of the chest area. Scratching on the back of the body included a fairly long scratch down the centre of the back, consistent with the body having been dragged from the lounge room of the premises into the kitchen. At the time of death, Mr Collins was approximately 167 centimetres tall and weighed 41 kilograms. 
     
      
    3 A large amount of blood in the lounge room of the premises and in particular on the architraves of a door and an adjacent wall, was consistent with a sustained and vicious assault on Mr Collins in that room. Three of four knives smeared with blood, consistent with the DNA of the victim, were found in the vicinity of a lounge and lounge chair. The dimensions of the stab wounds to Mr Collins’ body were consistent with the use of any one or more of those three knives in the course of the assault upon him. 
     
      
    4 The Crown case at trial, which the jury accepted, was that each of the offenders was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Collins. For sentencing purposes, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an intention to kill, formed by each of the participants to the agreement. Nor did the Crown press for that finding. The evidence against each offender in support of the existence of the agreement and their respective participation in it, is outlined in greater detail below. Let me record at the outset that, after reviewing the respective case against each offender, I am unable to determine to the requisite standard which one of the offenders struck the fatal blow to Mr Collins’ neck. Nor is it possible to attribute a substantially greater role in the assaults to any one offender. There is evidence which points in different directions, but the fact remains that there is no reliable evidence allowing such conclusions to be reached beyond reasonable doubt. In the light of the evidence against each offender and, given the number and distribution of the various injuries to Mr Collins, I am nonetheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all three offenders inflicted injury upon him, to some extent. 
     
      
    5 Nor is it possible to determine, with any certainty, what triggered the assaults upon Mr Collins. Mr Smit provided information to the police which suggested that he believed that Mr Collins was about to rape or was raping Ms Tarrant when he, Mr Smit, went to Ms Tarrant’s assistance. Given the implausibility of several aspects of Mr Smit’s explanation to police in the course of his record of interview, I am unable to conclude that Mr Smit’s belief was founded in fact. However, I accept, for the reasons which appear below, that Mr Smit entertained such a belief and that his perception of an assault upon Ms Tarrant prompted an assault upon Mr Collins in which all three offenders joined and which was out of all proportion to the circumstances, culminating in Mr Collins’ death. Mrs Smit gave evidence at trial in which she claimed that Mr Collins was doing no more than standing in the kitchen, behind Ms Tarrant, attempting to kiss and cuddle her. According to Mrs Smit, Ms Tarrant became annoyed and both women left the premises, returning only after Mr Collins had been killed. The jury’s rejection of her evidence suggests that this account of Mr Collins’ behaviour is suspect. Accepting that it may have occurred, it cannot explain the severity of the assaults. Clearly, the attack was sudden, unplanned and unpremeditated. 
     
      
    6 When the realisation dawned upon the offenders that Mr Collins had died as a result of the attack upon him, it would appear that Mrs Smit left the premises to seek the assistance of an acquaintance, Mr Ranse, in the disposal of the body. Mr Smit, on his own admission, remained in the premises for some hours, waiting for the return of his wife. Whilst there is no reliable evidence relating to Ms Tarrant’s whereabouts immediately after Mr Collins’ death, it is clear that she spoke to Mr Ranse some time after 29 August, in the hope that he would assist her in establishing an alibi for the relevant period of time. 
     
      
    7 In summary, this was a spontaneous, senseless, brutal and callous assault on a seemingly harmless man, who had offered hospitality to the offenders. The degree of violence was substantial and there was an attempt, albeit short-lived, to conceal the offence and dispose of the body. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing exercise is complicated to some extent by the fact that this is the second occasion on which all three offenders have been found guilty of the murder of Mr Collins. In March 2003, they were convicted after a trial before Hulme J and sentenced on 2 October 2003. Hulme J made certain findings of fact which led to the imposition of identical sentences upon Mr and Mrs Smit, but a lesser sentence on Ms Tarrant. Following a successful appeal against conviction, the trial re-commenced before me on 17 August 2005. All counsel, including the Crown, submitted that there were no circumstances warranting the imposition of a longer sentence or non-parole period than that imposed by Hulme J, in respect of each offender. However, counsel for each offender submitted that there were at least subjective circumstances justifying a lesser sentence than that imposed by Hulme J. The Crown resisted those submissions. 
     
      
    9 The departure point in any consideration of re-sentencing after a successful appeal is R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416. The matters of policy underlying the principle that an accused should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence, or non-parole period than those received at the first trial were explored at length by Street CJ. It was not until R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711 that the qualification to that principle was made explicit, namely that where circumstances justify the imposition of a longer sentence, a sentencing judge is bound to give effect to his/her assessment. Those circumstances may include a manifestly lenient sentence imposed at the first trial, more serious criminality established by the evidence at the second trial, and the offender’s subjective case appearing less favourable at the second trial. 
     
      
    10 In McL v R (2000) 203 CLR 452, Gleeson CJ, Gauldron and Callinan JJ referred to Gilmore with approval. However, the existence of an independent sentencing discretion was recognised, in so far as the weight to be accorded to the consideration outlined in Gilmore was said to be “a matter relevant to the exercise of discretion by a judge sentencing the appellant” after a second trial. Similarly, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ referred to the principle as one which applies “ordinarily, but not invariably”. Kirby J also expressed the principle as a general one, which admits of exceptions, including where “the facts as they appear at the time of re-sentence are significantly different from those upon which the first sentence was based”. 
     
      
    11 Levine J in R v MM [2002] NSWCCA 431 confirmed that there was no inflexible rule, rather the exercise of an independent sentencing discretion allowed for an increase in sentence, where “good reasons” for that increase were exposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    12 Bearing these principles in mind, I turn to the evidence at trial. The forensic evidence against Mr Smit included a pair of joggers, a pair of tracksuit pants and a tee-shirt retrieved from Mr and Mrs Smit’s home, said to have been worn by him or belonging to him. All three items were stained with a quantity of blood consistent with that of the victim. The keys to Mr Collins’ flat were also found at the home of Mr and Mrs Smit. The distribution of the blood stains on the items of clothing and the shoes was consistent with blood having been sprayed or splattered from wounds inflicted on Mr Collins at the time of the infliction of those wounds. Mr Smit undertook a record of interview with the police on 31 August 2001. At first he told police that he had visited Mr Collins in the company of his wife and Ms Tarrant some 10 to 14 days prior to the interview. He then acknowledged that he had been to the premises on the Sunday prior to the interview. Mr Smit said that on the latter occasion he and his wife were at the premises with Mr Collins and Ms Tarrant, playing music, when the occupant of the flat upstairs came to request that they turn the music down. Mr Smit said he was “pretty drunk” and that he had fallen asleep, that he did not know what happened and that he woke up on the couch and left. He said that at that time he was alone and when he arrived home his wife was there. He said that he saw Mr Collins when he left and he was “lying on the floor … he didn’t look too healthy”. At that point Mr Smit told police he would be frank with them. He explained that during the evening he (Mr Collins) “was trying to, the other girl not Shiree, he was trying to rape her”. Mr Smit said that he “pulled him up a bit on that. Didn’t kill him.” He went on to say that he had punched him a couple of times, dragged him off Ms Tarrant, and that Mr Collins was wearing nothing more than a shirt at that time. He went on to say Mr Collins admitted that he was trying to rape Ms Tarrant and that thereafter Mr Collins tried to hit Mr Smit with a cricket bat. Mr Smit said he was trying to grab the cricket bat, then he let Mr Collins go and Mr Collins came back at him with the cricket bat. Eventually Mr Smit took the cricket bat from Mr Collins and tossed it aside. According to Mr Smit’s account, Mr Collins then attempted to stab Ms Tarrant, although he did not see from where Mr Collins obtained the knife. Ms Tarrant was said to be “freaking out” at this time. Mr Smit said that he tried to take the knife from Mr Collins and that Mr Colins and Ms Tarrant appeared to be wrestling with each other. Thereafter Mr Smit says that he did not know what occurred, but at some point he realised Mr Collins was dead and he moved Mr Collins into the kitchen and placed the cricket bat next to the body within the blankets. He said that he thought someone had gone for help and that he waited approximately eight or nine hours after he had moved the body, before leaving the premises. When Mr Smit arrived home he saw his wife and Ms Tarrant, but had no conversation with either of them as to the events that evening.  
     
      
    13 One only has to read the record of interview in the light of the forensic evidence against Mr Smit to reach the conclusion that his account to police is substantially lacking in credibility. It is not surprising that the jury rejected Mr Smit’s denial of having inflicted any serious injury upon Mr Collins. Even were I to accept Mr Smit’s own admission, in respect of his contact with the cricket bat and with a knife, said to be produced by Mr Collins, there is no evidence which would allow me to conclude beyond reasonable doubt which of the weapons used in the assault upon Mr Collins was, in fact, wielded by Mr Smit. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Smit was in reasonably close proximity to Mr Collins, either at the time Mr Smit was inflicting wounds upon Mr Collins, or whilst either Ms Tarrant and/or Mrs Smit were inflicting wounds upon Mr Collins. That much seems clear from the blood splatter found on Mr Smit’s clothing. 
     
      
    14 A significant departure in the conduct of the trial before me from that conducted before Hulme J was Mr Smit’s acknowledgement from the outset of the trial that he bore some responsibility for Mr Collins’ death, albeit that responsibility fell short of responsibility for murder. A substantial body of evidence was placed before the jury at trial, tending to establish that Mr Smit was suffering the effects of a drug-induced psychosis on the day of Mr Collins’ death. The jury’s verdict against Mr Smit signifies the rejection of that evidence, in so far as it failed to satisfy the jury that the psychosis was operative at the time of the assault upon Mr Collins, or that it was of such a gravity that it was capable of reducing Mr Smit’s culpability from murder to manslaughter. Similarly, the jury rejected Mr Smit’s intoxication due to alcohol and drugs as a relevant factor in the formation of the requisite intent for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    15 As indicated at the outset of these remarks on sentence, I accept that a perception on Mr Smit’s part that Mr Collins was behaving inappropriately towards Ms Tarrant provoked Mr Smit to assault Mr Collins. I also accept that Mr Smit’s capacity to exercise judgment and restraint was compromised to a degree by his heavy consumption of amphetamines and other drugs in the weeks leading up to the commission of the offence. Whilst there is documented evidence of Mr Smit’s irrational behaviour during that time, I am unable to determine to what extent Mr Smit was affected by amphetamines or other drugs on the evening in question, there being no reliable evidence of the consumption of those drugs in the hours preceding the offence. To the extent that Mr Smit was affected by drugs and/or alcohol at the time of the assaults upon Mr Collins, it may explain the commission of the offence, but does not operate to mitigate Mr Smit’s liability. 
     
      
    16 The case against Mrs Smit consisted of a fingerprint impression belonging to Mrs Smit on one of the knives bearing the blood of the victim. That knife was found on a chair in the victim’s lounge room. In addition, the evidence from Mr Ranse was that at the time Mrs Smit approached him seeking his help to dispose of the body, she said “both of us, but mainly Steve” had killed Mr Collins “with a cricket bat”. (I pause to observe that this statement was not admissible against Mr Smit.) That conversation was denied by Mrs Smit at trial. It is clear that the jury accepted Mr Ranse and his account of the conversation with Mrs Smit. The jury also patently rejected Mrs Smit’s evidence at trial which sought to explain how her fingerprint came to be on the relevant knife. That explanation was that following Mr Collins’ inappropriate behaviour towards Ms Tarrant, both Mrs Smit and Ms Tarrant left the premises and returned some hours later to find the lounge room covered in blood and nothing but the sound of the shower coming from the adjacent bathroom. Mrs Smit claimed to have picked up the knife which was lying on the floor, but was not able to explain why she did that. She saw Ms Tarrant “go to touch a cricket bat that was there with blood all over it”. She saw the body of Mr Collins in the kitchen and drew Ms Tarrant’s attention to it. According to Mrs Smit they both left the premises and agreed to meet at the Carrington Hotel in about an hour’s time. It is to be noted that Mrs Smit did not give evidence at the trial before Hulme J, although the jury’s rejection of her evidence does not substantially add anything to the Crown case against her. The jury was directed that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Smit’s print was placed on the knife at the time of the assaults upon Mr Collins, before they could use it towards proof of the Crown case. On the basis of this evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Smit inflicted some injuries upon Mr Collins, but I am unable to conclude to what extent Mrs Smit was directly responsible for the infliction of the various wounds upon Mr Collins’ body. 
     
      
    17 The case against Ms Tarrant consisted of a partial palm print on the blade of the cricket bat, which was deposited by the transfer of blood from the hand to the cricket bat. In addition, Ms Tarrant gave a record of interview to police on 1 September 2001, in which she denied any knowledge of the matter and denied any maltreatment at the hands of Mr Collins. Ms Tarrant said she had last seen Mr Collins about a week prior at the Katoomba Hotel. Ms Tarrant admitted that she had at some stage shared the premises with Mr Collins, but that she had last stayed there or lived there some three or four months ago. She said that she had consumed amphetamines whilst staying at Mr Collins’ house. The Crown relied upon the lies told by Ms Tarrant in her record of interview as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. The jury were directed that in order to use the evidence of Ms Tarrant’s palm print on the cricket bat towards proof of the charge against her, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the print was deposited on the bat at the time of the assaults upon Mr Collins. In my view, the jury’s verdict reflects satisfaction to that standard. Accordingly, both Ms Tarrant’s account to police and Mrs Smit’s evidence in relation to Ms Tarrant’s role in the events of that evening were rejected by the jury. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Tarrant also inflicted some injuries upon Mr Collins, although I am unable to determine to what degree. 
     
      
    18 It is appropriate that I note the findings of fact made by Hulme J to the extent that they depart from the findings I have made above. In relation to Ms Tarrant, Hulme J found that “there was nothing …. to show that her role was more than at the lowest level of participation”. As for Mrs Smit, Hulme J found that she “had some active involvement going appreciably beyond mere presence and a minimum level of encouragement or assistance”. Hulme J found that Mr Smit “also had some active involvement going appreciably beyond mere presence and a minimum level of encouragement.” Hulme J went on to say that “I have no doubt also that violence was at the hands of one or more of the prisoners. However, the evidence against the prisoners individually does not permit me to make findings more adverse to them than I have done”. Part of the explanation for Hulme J’s findings in the terms cited above lies in the manner in which the Crown case was left to the jury at the first trial. Not only was the jury directed on joint criminal enterprise, but they were also directed on the basis that any one of them could be convicted if the jury found that they were present and intentionally encouraging or assisting a principal offender. It was, therefore, at least theoretically available to Hulme J to find that Ms Tarrant was not “a principal offender”, but that she was present and intentionally encouraging or assisting someone else. The restriction of the Crown case at the second trial to one of joint criminal enterprise allows the verdicts of the jury to be interpreted more narrowly than was the case before Hulme J. In any event, as I have attempted to demonstrate above, the objective evidence at trial does not permit a finding of fact beyond reasonable doubt that there was a “principal offender”.  
     
      
    19 It follows that I do not feel constrained by the considerations explored in Gilmore Bedford and McL v the Queen to impose sentences in identical terms to those imposed by Hulme J. I approach the sentencing exercise consistent with the findings of fact that I have made, bearing in mind that the subjective case in respect of each offender is somewhat more favourable than that presented to Hulme J. It is to those respective subjective matters that I now turn. 
     
      
    20 Mr Smit was born on 19 July 1970 and was raised in a loving and supportive family environment. His father was and remains a pastor and his parents have done everything in their power to assist Mr Smit in the latter years of what was undoubtedly a serious drug addiction. Mr Smit is said to be of above average intelligence and left school in Year 11. He took up an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic, but failed to complete it. He has been in employment from time to time, largely of an unskilled nature. Mr Smit’s adult life has been marred by the abuse of drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines and excessive consumption of alcohol. He has also been addicted to both rohypnol and methadone. In the months prior to the commission of the offence, Mr Smit was reportedly withdrawing from methadone, but had turned instead to a cocktail of alcohol, rohypnol and amphetamines. The evidence at trial which was tendered for the purposes of sentence established that on 5 July 2001 Mr Smit was observed by police and by officers from the Department of Community Services to be exhibiting a level of paranoia, irrationality and aggression. The events of 5 July centred around an attempt by DOCs officers to intervene on behalf of Mr and Mrs Smit’s children. A number of police officers who were also involved in the investigation of Mr Collins’ murder were present on 5 July and made independent observations of Mr Smit’s behaviour.  
     
      
    21 In the course of the trial, Associate Professor Hayes of the University of Sydney gave evidence of Mr Smit’s history of drug abuse, obtained largely from Mr Smit himself. Professor Hayes also had access to the documents relating to the events of 5 July. Professor Hayes records that Mr Smit had a severe drug problem by the age of 18 or 19 years, including abuse of cocaine, speed and alcohol. At age 21 he was imprisoned for possession and supply of cannabis. He later became addicted to heroin and rohypnol and tried unsuccessfully to detoxify and rehabilitate himself. Mr Smit and Mrs Smit married in 1997, at which time Mr Smit was drug free apart from methadone and abuse of rohypnol. In that period he was stable and in employment.  
     
      
    22 According to Professor Hayes’ report, Mr Smit decided to come off methadone and remain self-medicated on rohypnol. However, he was unable to obtain rohypnol and commenced using amphetamine. Mr Smit himself offered the opinion that he became psychotic and delusional. He was reportedly in this state on 5 July 2001. I have already observed that the jury rejected Professor Hayes’ evidence and her opinion that Mr Smit was suffering from a drug induced psychosis at the time of the offence for the purposes of reducing the charge of murder to one of manslaughter. That evidence was not placed before the jury in the trial before Hulme J and only became relevant on the question of sentence. Hulme J accepted Professor Hayes’ opinion that Mr Smit’s prognosis was good, provided he remained abstinent and that his prospects of rehabilitation depended largely on his resolve in that regard. Importantly, Hulme J found that there was no evidence of contrition, although the inference was drawn that Mr Smit appreciated the consequences of his previous lifestyle.  
     
      
    23 In the light of Mr Smit’s acknowledgement through his counsel at the beginning of the second trial, that he accepted his liability for the offence of manslaughter, there is direct evidence of some contrition before me which was not available to Hulme J. Moreover, Mr Smit gave evidence in the course of the sentencing proceedings. He stated that the death of Mr Collins “was a tragedy and he shouldn’t have died and after hearing Mr Collins’ impact statement, we can all see why he shouldn’t have died.” Mr Smit expressed shame for his part in Mr Collins’ death and appeared to display genuine empathy for the grief suffered by Mr Collins’ family. Mr Smit confirmed that the victim’s death had forced him to appraise his life and the direction it was taking. He expressed resolve not to resume his former lifestyle. There was evidence of the completion of a number of drug and alcohol courses, both while on remand and since he was sentenced on the first occasion. Mr Smit was to undertake a violence prevention course at Long Bay shortly prior to the appeal against the conviction at the first trial. Following his reconviction, Mr Smit is to resume the violence prevention program at the Special Care Unit at Long Bay and expressed an interest in participating in the Adult Mentor Program for young inmates.  
     
      
    24 A Mr David Pettit, the Anglican Chaplain at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater came to know Mr Smit in December of 2004. Mr Smit impressed Mr Pettit by his willingness to assist other inmates and by his appointment as an official prisoner delegate. Mr Smit’s mother gave evidence of the dramatic change in her son’s personality, lifestyle and attitude since his arrest. Much of the information contained in the pre-sentence report of 2 June 2003 (Exhibit 6) was confirmed by a more detailed and more current report under the hand of Ms Duffy (Exhibit 8). Mr Smit accepts that his relationship with his wife is over, but expressed a strong desire to resume a positive role in fathering the two children of that relationship. Those children are in the custody of their maternal grandmother.  
     
      
    25 I accept that the passage of time has allowed Mr Smit’s prospects of rehabilitation to be demonstrated in a more substantial respect than was the case before Hulme J. It is also submitted that there is real remorse and contrition, which should result in an appreciable reduction in the sentence imposed in October 2003. I return to this submission below, in the context of parity. 
     
      
    26 Mr Smit’s prior criminal history contains a number of offences consistent with his drug abuse, namely driving with a prescribed concentration of alcohol, property offences and offences involving the possession, supply and administration of prohibited drugs. He has also been convicted of possession of an unauthorised and unregistered firearm. He has one prior conviction for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm recorded in 1994, for which he received two years’ suspended sentence. The longest term of imprisonment served by Mr Smit prior to his incarceration for this offence was one of six months’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    27 Turning to the subjective case on behalf of Mrs Smit, her progress since her incarceration was the subject of evidence from Babette Smith, an official visitor to Mullawa prison. According to Ms Smith, Mrs Smit has developed self-discipline and a calm, stoic attitude since coming into custody. Ms Smit had changed from a verbally aggressive young woman to a trustworthy and responsible inmate within the prison system. Mrs Smit has completed a diploma in aromatherapy and intends pursuing that study at a tertiary level so that she might be gainfully employed upon her release. Mrs Smit is understandably distressed by the absence of her children, but has remained committed to regular contact with them by way of video link or personal visits when they are able to travel from Dubbo in the company of their grandmother. Ms Smith’s opinion was supported by a reference from the Anglican Chaplain at Mullawa and by the Anglican Chaplain at Roseville College. Mrs Smit’s mother provided a letter to the Court which complemented the evidence she had given before Hulme J on sentence. The case notes relating to Mrs Smit produced by the Department of Corrective Services notes the offender’s involvement in tertiary education studies, her involvement with a pilot program aiming to assist inmates with children to maintain family identity, her employment as a clerk for the Manager of Industries, exercising substantial responsibility in a trusted position, and her active role in the Inmate Development Committee, fund raising activities on the part of inmates and voluntary tutoring programs designed to assist other inmates with learning difficulties. 
     
      
    28 In terms of Mrs Smit’s earlier history, she reportedly left school during Year 11 and worked for approximately three years before falling pregnant and becoming engaged. Tragically Mrs Smit’s fiancé was killed in a car accident when she was five months pregnant. Shortly thereafter the offender’s grandfather died and her grandmother became a paraplegic. Within 18 months of these events, Mrs Smit commenced to use illicit drugs. That use continued unabated until she went into custody following the instant offence. Once again Mrs Smit’s antecedents include property offences and minor traffic offences which appear to reflect her unstable lifestyle. She is presently 35 years of age. Her first recorded conviction was in 1982 and her longest period of imprisonment prior to this matter was for a period of one month. 
     
      
    29 A report under the hand of Dr Nielssen, which was also available before Hulme J, records Mrs Smit’s drug history as related by her to Dr Nielssen. Mrs Smit said she was a long term user of amphetamine, that she had become addicted to heroin and thence methadone and benzodiazepines. According to Mrs Smit’s account to Dr Nielssen, she had been prescribed methadone and rohypnol in the months prior to Mr Collins’ death. She reported a previous episode of a drug induced psychosis, although she claimed no relevant impairment of memory of the events surrounding Mr Collins’ death and continued to assert her innocence. Her relationship with Mr Smit was said to be based entirely upon their mutual abuse of drugs. In all, Mrs Smit has four children, all of whom are in the permanent care of her parents. 
     
      
    30 As is the case with Mr Smit, Mrs Smit’s prognosis and her prospects of rehabilitation are directly linked to her ability to remain drug free. Given the passage of time and Mrs Smit’s progress within the custodial setting, her prospects of rehabilitation have been more cogently demonstrated on this occasion than they were before Hulme J. 
     
      
    31 Ms Tarrant is presently 33 years of age, having been born in Katoomba on 24 August 1972. Her parents separated when Ms Tarrant was 12 years of age. Her mother remarried. Initially Ms Tarrant stayed with her mother, but then moved to live with her father who became violent towards her, reportedly breaking her leg and fracturing her cheekbone on one occasion. At that point Ms Tarrant left home and moved into a youth refuge in Katoomba at the age of 13. Ms Tarrant was placed in a number of institutions by the Department of Community Services. When she was 15 years old she returned to live with her mother because she was pregnant at the time. Ms Tarrant’s daughter, now 18 years of age, lived with Ms Tarrant until 1996. Ms Tarrant’s daughter now has a baby son and lives with her partner and his family in Bathurst. Ms Tarrant has had recent contact with her daughter and grandchild. By the end of 1995, Ms Tarrant had five children, all under the age of 8 years. 
     
      
    32 On 27 May 1996 the youngest of Ms Tarrant’s children died from sudden infant death syndrome at the age of seven and a half months. In the wake of that event, Ms Tarrant began drinking alcohol and abusing drugs to the point where the Department of Community Services intervened and offered to mind the children temporarily whilst she recovered. In fact, the children were separated from each other and fostered to various homes. Ms Tarrant insisted on access visits and tried to regain custody of her children, but was unable to comply with the conditions imposed by DOCs, namely that she undergo residential rehabilitation at her own cost.  
     
      
    33 In 1997 Ms Tarrant signed custody of the children over to their respective fathers on the recommendation of the Department of Community Services. She lost all contact with her children and has only recently regained contact with a number of them. Following removal of her children from her care, Ms Tarrant met up with a drug user and commenced a relationship with him that exacerbated her own drug use. In December 1998 Ms Tarrant gave birth to a son who was taken from her by the Department of Community Services within 24 hours of his birth. Ms Tarrant claimed that she had been drug free since she discovered she was pregnant and that she twice attempted to regain custody of that child. She gave up and returned to drug abuse. That child is presently in foster care and is visiting Ms Tarrant regularly.  
     
      
    34 Ms Tarrant’s drug abuse commenced with cannabis at 13 and 14 years of age. She then refrained from illegal drug use for some years. At the age of 16 she began abusing amphetamines on an occasional basis. Her poly substance abuse (including alcohol, amphetamines and heroin) commenced following the death of her child. Ms Tarrant was addicted to heroin from about 1996 until approximately a year before her arrest for the present matter. At that time, she had been on a methadone programme, but decided to cease methadone usage without clinical supervision. At the time of the offence she said she was using amphetamines. She continues to assert her innocence and maintains that she was not present when Mr Collins was murdered. There is, therefore, no contrition on Ms Tarrant’s part. 
     
      
    35 Ms Tarrant’s first recorded offence in March of 1987 was one of malicious injury. Her antecedents include offences of assault, aggravated assault, resist arrest and a number of property offences, together with offences of possession of a prohibited drug. She has been convicted of unlawful wounding, but was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months. The longest period of time she has spent in custody is six months commencing on 31 August 2001 for a break enter and steal offence. 
     
      
    36 Ms Tarrant has been drug free since coming into custody. She has undertaken educational courses and is employed within the prison industry. Her primary motivation is her reconciliation with her children and her desire to be strongly independent and self-supporting. References from Mrs Smith, the Anglican Chaplain at Roseville College and the Anglican Chaplain at Mullawa describe Ms Tarrant as a quiet, gentle, helpful and co-operative inmate who has been recommended for a reduction in her classification in recognition of her positive contribution and her behaviour whilst at Mullawa. 
     
      
    37 This material establishes prospects of rehabilitation more favourable than were apparent before Hulme J. It must be said however that, as in the cases of Mr and Mrs Smit, those prospects are wholly dependent on this offender’s capacity to refrain from the abuse of alcohol and drugs upon her release into the community. 
     
      
    38 In respect of each of the objective and subjective factors to which I have referred above, I have taken into account the terms of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. None of the offenders is entitled to the mitigation extended by reason of the absence of any prior convictions. Obviously the offence was committed in company, although I have already noted the absence of any planning or pre-meditation. I do not accept that the offenders were provoked by any action on the part of Mr Collins that might justify the severity of the assaults visited upon him. I accept that each of the offenders is unlikely to commit an offence of this gravity at any time in the future and I also accept that each offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    39 In my view the basis of the jury’s verdict and the objective gravity of the offence warrant the imposition of the same sentence and non-parole period in respect of each offender. I am conscious of the fact that such a finding will result in a sentence in respect of Ms Tarrant which exceeds that imposed at first instance. In contemplating that result, I have had regard to the important policy considerations underlying the application of the principles relating to re-sentencing.  
     
      
    40 I am also conscious of the submission made by the offenders’ respective counsel on the issue of parity. Those submissions were, not surprisingly, impossible to reconcile as between each offender. Mr Smit’s contrition was said to set him apart from his co-offenders. It must be recognised, however, that his record of interview constituted powerful evidence against him; once admitted, no jury could, in my view, construe it as other than direct evidence of Mr Smit’s part in the assaults upon Mr Collins. It was all the more eloquent of his guilt for the fanciful version of the struggle with Mr Collins, followed by a period of sleep and waking to the presence of a body in a blood-soaked living room. To accept that Mr Smit is now remorseful is one thing; to place significant weight upon that remorse after the jury has found Mr Smit guilty of murder rather than manslaughter is another. In the result, I cannot sensibly differentiate between the offenders for the purposes of reflecting the principles of punishment, retribution and general deterrence in both the head sentence and the non-parole period of the sentences, even after allowance is made for each subjective case. 
     
      
    41 I have had regard to the victim impact statements tendered on behalf of Mr Collins’ father, sister and brother-in-law. It must be acknowledged that the experience of enduring another trial and all the uncertainty which that trial brings has imposed a considerable burden on Mr Collins’ close relatives. No judge of this Court who regularly sits in the criminal jurisdiction could fail to be moved by the long term effects experienced by family members arising out of the violent death of one of their number. Sentencing must however take place according to law and expressions of personal vengeance play no part in that sentencing function. Every sentencing exercise calls for the reconciliation of tensions between the objective and subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    42 As to the question of special circumstances, it is “received doctrine that the mere fact that a matter is capable of amounting to special circumstances does not mean that a finding and application in favour of an offender must be made”: R v Fraser (2005) NSWCCA 77 at par 48. Ultimately I have determined that the parole period provided by the usual statutory proportion is sufficient in the case of each offender to allow for a suitable period of supervision following release to the community. The proposed non-parole periods in each case are the least which can be imposed, in my view, consistent with the objective gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    43 In addition, it must be remembered that s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 does not apply in the circumstances of this case. For offences of this nature committed after 1 February 2003, one would expect to see a significant increase in the penalties imposed for the offence of murder. The offenders, however, must receive the benefit of the law as it applied to offences committed pre February 2003. 
     
      
    44 Each of the offenders have remained in custody since they were sentenced by Hulme J. Accordingly, I propose to adopt the same starting point for each of the sentences and nothing has been addressed to me to the contrary. Mr Smit, on the offence of murder, you are convicted. I impose a term of imprisonment of 16 years to date from 25 November 2001, to expire 24 November 2017. I impose a non-parole period of 12 years to date from 25 November 2001 to expire 24 November 2013.  
     
      
    45 Mrs Smit, on the offence of murder, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of 16 years’ imprisonment to date from 31 August 2001 to expire 30 August 2017. I impose a non-parole period of 12 years to date from 31 August 2001, expiring 30 August 2013. 
     
      
    46 Ms Tarrant, on the offence of murder, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of 16 years imprisonment to date from 31 August 2001 to expire 30 August 2017. I fix a non-parole period of 12 years to date from 31 August 2001, expiring 30 August 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 27 July 2004 the appellant was indicted before Nield DCJ at the Sydney District Court on a charge under s 98 of the Crimes Act that he on 10 May 2003 in Lewisham in the State of New South Wales being armed assaulted Salem Diab with intent to rob him and that he at the time of the assault wounded Salem Diab. The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour and a jury of twelve.  
     
      
    2 On 13 July 2004 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 19 November 2004 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years commencing on 12 February 2004 expiring on 11 February 2009 with a balance of term of three years commencing on 12 February 2009 and expiring on 11 February 2012. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case was in broad terms as follows.  
     
      
    4 On 10 May 2003 the complainant while working at his business, which was a convenience store in a back street in Lewisham, was attacked by two men, one of whom was armed with a pair of scissors. 
     
      
    5 The men, who appeared to be Aboriginal men, had entered the store a short time earlier and had selected some confectionary. One of the men proffered some money for the item and then, drawing a pair of scissors, demanded that the complainant give him money. The complainant refused to comply and kicked the man in the chest. A struggle ensued during which the man stabbed the complainant in his right arm and chin. The complainant managed to locate a kitchen knife and was able to frighten his assailants away. He chased them into the street. They ran and leapt into a car that had been parked in a side street and which carried them away. After returning to his store and telephoning for assistance, the complainant saw the man who had stabbed him run into the front of the store and retrieve a shoe he had left behind.  
     
      
    6 A short time after the stabbing, Dr Jesmond Sammut, whose house was located near the store, while working in his garden and after hearing some yelling, saw persons sitting in a vehicle parked nearby. He felt suspicious about their presence and went to investigate. He noted registration of the vehicle, which was a red Holden Commodore. He saw it drive down the street and return to park a short distance away from him. Still feeling suspicious he closely observed the occupants and in particular a passenger, with whom he became locked in a mutual stare for about 3 or 4 seconds before the vehicle took off and stopped outside the complainant's store. Dr Sammut saw the passenger leave the vehicle and enter the store and return to the vehicle a short time later.  
     
      
    7 Meryl Blundell and Ingo Voss who lived next to the store were arriving home with their children. They saw the vehicle and saw an Aboriginal man exit the vehicle and enter and leave the store.  
     
      
    8 The appellant was apprehended two days after the stabbing incident. When arrested he was driving the red Commodore. 
     
      
    9 The appellant was subsequently identified by Dr Sammut from an array of photographs, and the Crown case relied primarily on his identification.  
     
      
    10 The issue of identification was crucial in this case.  
     
      
    11 The complainant gave evidence that his assailant was Aboriginal, shorter than himself, and gave other features of his description; and he also gave a general description of the other man. Five days after the incident, the complainant attended a police station and, whilst being filmed with a video recorder, examined 15 numbered photographs to see if he could identify his attacker. He was recorded saying: ""This one looks familiar and this one yeah"", before nominating 2 photographs, neither of which depicted the appellant. Later, he is recorded as saying: ""Actually I'm very sure now, yeah"", and affirming he was very sure that the persons depicted in those photos were the people. He also said that men in other photos were “off the list”. It appeared from the evidence that the complainant later found out that neither of the two men he selected was the man suspected by the police, and his evidence in court was to the effect that he was never a hundred percent sure and that he had told the police he could not pick them out.  
     
      
    12 The identification evidence relied on by the Crown was that of Dr Sammut. His evidence was that, at the time he and the passenger in the car were staring at each other, he was about 2 and half metres from the passenger. He observed that the passenger had roundish face with a slightly flattened nose, that his skin was brown to dark brown, that he had dark hair, 2 to 3 days growth. He also had dark eyebrows slightly angled downwards and almond-shaped eyes. His hair appeared to be covered by a beanie. He had not prior to the day of the incident seen this person. He also gave a description of the other man at the scene. 
     
      
    13 Five days after the incident, Dr Sammut went to the police station and, whilst being video taped, examined 15 numbered photograph. When he saw photograph 4 he put it to one side as he went through the photographs; and then he said: ""I think I have identified one person"", and said that the man looked very familiar.  
     
      
    14 At a later point he asked the police whether he had picked out the person who the police were alleging committed the offence, and was told that he had. In his evidence he said he was quite confident about his selection, but careful in his use of words, because he was aware of the serious consequences that might flow from his assertions; and he said that he had only a very minor doubt about his selection.  
     
      
    15 The evidence given by other witnesses was not of great assistance in identification of the assailant, though there were a number of estimates of height which it is not necessary to recount. 
     
      
    16 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial, and his defence essentially involved challenging the identification evidence of the Crown.  
     
      
    17 The complainant was cross examined concerning the identification process, and conceded that towards the end of the process he had actually felt sure that the men depicted in the photographs he had identified were his attackers, and that the men in the other photographs could be with regarded as being off the list. He agreed that he had later learned that neither of the persons he had selected was suspected of committing the offence. He conceded that, during a previous trial in relation to this matter, he had identified the appellant's height at 5-foot 10 inches. It appears from the evidence that the appellants height was of the order of 5-foot five and half or 5-foot 6 inches.  
     
      
    18 One other matter relied on by the defence was that the complainant and the appellant had provided a DNA sample to the police, and it was conceded that tests carried out on blood on the scissors and at the scene did not provide any evidence linking the appellant with the scene.  
     
      
    19 The appellant relies on a single ground of appeal namely: 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour's direction to the jury in relation to the identification evidence were inadequate in the circumstances of this case and led to an unbalanced presentation of the essential issue for the jury's determination.  
        
       
      
    20 In support of this ground Mr Austin for the appellant made a number of points.  
     
      
    21 In general terms, he submitted that the trial judge failed to direct in clear terms concerning the photograph identification evidence of Dr Sammut and Mr Diab; and that the effect of the direction was not to give a balanced view of the matter to the jury, but that the direction amounted to advocacy in favour of the reliability of the identification evidence of Dr Sammut.  
     
      
    22 Mr Austin submitted that the trial judge created an impression that the task for the jury was to select the more reliable identification evidence, and also created the impression, by his discussion of matters that could affect the accuracy of identification evidence, that the evidence of Dr Sammut was more reliable than that of Mr Diab.  
     
      
    23 He submitted that the trial judge did not comment that Dr Sammut was subsequently told that he had picked out the right person and only then became positive as to his identification of the appellant, and did not comment that Mr Diab's retreat in his oral evidence from identification of persons other than the appellant was on his being told that he did not choose the police suspect.  
     
      
    24 A further particular submission by Mr Austin was that the trial judge failed to explain the relevance of various estimates as to the height of the assailant given by various witnesses, and in particular Mr Diab's evidence indicating that his assailant was only about one and half inches shorter than he was, whereas the appellant was in fact about 5 and half inches shorter. Mr Austin submitted that this was particularly significant, because problems raised by the trial judge concerning the reliability of Mr Diab's identification were not such as to affect his estimate of height to the same degree.  
     
      
    25 One further particular submission made by Mr Austin was that the trial judge did not direct the jury that it was more difficult for a member of one race to identify an individual from another racial group.  
     
      
    26 As I have said, the general submission made was that the overall effect of the summing up was advocacy in favour of the reliability of Dr Sammut's identification.  
     
      
    27 Two further matters raised in written submissions, though not pursued in oral submissions before us, were these. Firstly, there was a submission that the trial judge erred in suggesting that the appellant's association some 40 hours later with the red Commodore vehicle seen at the time of the offence could support Dr Sammut's identification of the appellant. Secondly, Mr Austin submitted that the trial judge erred in giving no direction that the evidence of a witness Mr Voss that the passenger got out of the back seat of the car conflicted with the evidence of Dr Sammut, and no direction that neither Mr Voss nor another witness Miss Blundell had identified the appellant.  
     
      
    28 I will deal in turn with these submissions. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion, the trial judge’s review of features of evidence that could be relevant to the accuracy of identification evidence was unobjectionable. The jury necessarily had to come to a view as to the reliability of Dr Sammut's identification, and also as to the proper effect to be given to the evidence relevant to identification given by Mr Diab. The trial judge’s summing up at this point did not suggest that the jury merely had to determine which out of the evidence of these 2 persons was the more reliable. He appropriately and repeatedly stressed to the jury they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the assailant, and that they had to consider identification evidence very carefully before they could be so satisfied. The circumstance that the factors discussed by the trial judge supported the reliability of the evidence of Dr Sammut more than the reliability of the evidence of Mr Diab would not in my opinion make the summing up unbalanced, unless some matter could be pointed out which did not fairly reflect the situation; and Mr Austin has not been able to point out any error of that kind. 
     
      
    30 As regards the submissions concerning identification of a person from another racial group, the trial judge did, following submissions by the appellant's then counsel, direct the jury's attention to the fact that Dr Sammut's selection of a photograph of the appellant was a case of one man identifying by photograph another man of a different racial group. In my opinion, there was no necessity for the trial judge to go on and say this made identification more doubtful because it is more difficult for a member of one race to identify an individual of another racial group. I am doubtful whether it would have been appropriate to say this, although it might have been appropriate to say words to the effect that the jury might consider that it was more difficult for a member of one race to identify an individual of another racial group. In any event, in my opinion what the trial judge said was sufficient to raise for the consideration of the jury the question whether the jury considered this to be a matter relevant to the reliability of Dr Sammut's identification of the appellant. In fact, the appellant's counsel did not ask for any further direction after that. 
     
      
    31 The matters I have discussed so far were raised by appellant's counsel at the trial following the summing up by the trial judge. The remaining matters to which I will come were not explicitly raised by him, and that could give rise to a question whether leave should be granted to raise them pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. However, Mr Austin submitted that Counsel raised the question of the balance of the trial judge’s summing up on identification, and that these other matters to which I will come were within the ambit of that general objection.  
     
      
    32 On the question of the impact on the identification evidence of what Dr Sammut and Mr Diab later learnt about whether the persons they had selected were or were not was suspected by the police, the jury had the videotape of the identification procedure in the case of both witnesses, and also a transcript of this procedure, so they were in a position to reach their own judgment as to the confidence with which Dr Sammut made his identification of the photograph of the appellant; and they also had a statement made by Dr Sammut on the same day, namely 15 May 2003, which asserted he had identified the person depicted in the photograph as the person he saw in the front passenger seat of the red Commodore vehicle.  
     
      
    33 In my opinion, it was not an error for the trial judge not to have specifically pointed out to the jury that the confidence of Dr Sammut in his identification as displayed in his oral evidence could be seen as being affected by his being told by the police that he had chosen the suspect. Particularly is this so in circumstances where no request was made by the appellant's counsel to the trial judge do this. It is also to be noted that in his final directions the trial judge referred the jury specifically to the videotape of the identification process and not to what Dr Sammut had said in his evidence.  
     
      
    34 In relation to the identification of two persons other than the appellant by Mr Diab, this was evidence which could be considered as tending to exculpate the appellant. Mr Diab's evidence at the trial, to the effect that he was never a hundred percent sure and that he told the police he could not pick them out, could have been regarded as not significantly detracting from the force of what happened in the identification process, in circumstances where Mr Diab had by then been told that the persons he selected were not suspects.  
     
      
    35 However, the trial judge did tell the jury that they should take into account Mr Diab's identification of the 2 photographs and in doing so view the videotape and read the transcript. He was not asked to draw the jury's attention to the circumstance that Mr Diab's retreat from that identification in the witness box could be viewed as being due to what he was told by the police. In my opinion, particularly in circumstances where he was not asked to do this, it was not an error for the trial judge not to do this, particularly in circumstances where he had directed the attention of the jury, in his final summing up directions to them, to the videotape and to the transcript of the actual process.  
     
      
    36 In my opinion also, there was no inadequacy or error in the directions concerning the various witnesses’ estimates of height. In the circumstances in which Mr Diab made his observations, I do not think evidence to the effect that the assailant was about one and half inches shorter than he was, whereas the appellant was in fact about 5 and half inches shorter, was of such significance that it required a specific direction. The matter had recently been the subject of addresses by the appellant's Counsel, and the appellant's Counsel did not see the need for requesting a specific direction to that effect.  
     
      
    37 Having regard to all these considerations, I do not think that the summing up can be considered to have been unbalanced.  
     
      
    38 Turning to the question of the association of the appellant with the red Commodore vehicle, in my opinion that was a matter that could be taken into account by the jury in deciding whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the assailant. The case against the appellant could not be established unless the jury found the identification evidence of Dr Sammut satisfactory and compelling. But the trial judge did not in his summing up suggest to the jury that, even if they did not find the identification evidence of Dr Sammut satisfactory and compelling, they could use the association of the appellant with the vehicle as making up for this deficiency in the identification evidence.  
     
      
    39 As regards the final matters, in my opinion there was no inadequacy or error in the directions of the trial judge concerning different witnesses’ evidence as to the location of the assailant in the vehicle, or in relation to the absence of identification of any person by Mr Voss or Miss Blundell.  
     
      
    40 For those reasons in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    41 McCLELLAN CJ: I agree with Justice Hodgson.  
     
      
    42 BARR JA: I also agree.  
     
      
    43 HODGSON JA: The order of the court is the appeal is dismissed.

     AMP GENERAL INSURANCE LTD. V. KULL & ANOR. 
      
     Judgment 
      
    1 GILES JA: For the reasons given by Hodgson JA, whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading in draft, the verdict for Mr Kull against Mr Maloney should stand but with the damages reduced to $118,788. I qualify my agreement in this respect to the extent that I do not think it necessary, if Giorginis v Kastrati (1988) 48 SASR 371 so suggests, that a plaintiff admit tax evasion before earnings greater than those disclosed to tax authorities can be taken into account in assessing his damages. The Court must decide on the evidence before it. The evidence may warrant, indeed require, the conclusion that the plaintiffs earnings exceeded his declared income even if the plaintiff has not admitted non-disclosure of income. That is so in the present case, on the evidence of Dr Mayman and Mr McMurray called in Mr Kull's case.  
     
      
    2 I respectfully differ from his Honour, however, as to Mr Maloney's entitlement to indemnity from AMP. In explaining why that is so, I take up without repetition the facts and statutory provisions found in his Honour's judgment.  
     
      
       
      Policy 8  
      
    3 In my opinion, the cover in Section A4 of the policy did not extend to the Landcruiser.  
     
      
    4 None of the Farm Vehicles in the Schedule was a motor vehicle of the nature of the Landcruiser. The reference to ""the Vehicle"" in Section A4 must be read as a reference to the Farm Vehicles in the Schedule, and the requirement that a motor vehicle other than the Farm Vehicles be used, and more particularly the description of that motor vehicle as a substitute motor vehicle, in my view indicates that the motor vehicle must be a functional substitute for one of the Farm Vehicles in the Schedule. A similar functional substitution is seen in Section A6 of the policy. The Landcruiser was not a functional substitute for a tractor, slasher etc.  
     
      
    5 It is most unlikely that the parties to the policy intended that the insured's domestic motor vehicle would be the subject of cover if, but only if, his tractor, slasher, etc happened to be in the shed. Rather, the natural intention was that there would be cover in respect of a tractor, slasher etc, used by the insured instead of the equivalent equipment in the Schedule. The words are entirely apt to express that intention. The contra proferentem rule of construction is of limited usefulness, only ""where dictionaries alone and logic do not resolve an ambiguity"" (per Kirby J in Insurance Commission of Western Australia v Container Handlers Pty Ltd (2004) 206 ALR 335 at [98]). I do not think there is occasion to resort to it.  
     
      
    6 Mr Maloney is therefore not entitled to indemnity under Policy 8.  
     
      
       
      Policy 9  
      
    7 In my opinion, exclusion 1.b. applied.  
     
      
    8 It is understandable to see the policy as intended to cover the insured against claims arising from the use of a motor vehicle which are not covered by the compulsory third-party policy. But that must yield to the words of the policy, and I respectfully prefer the approach of Mason P in HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd v Pluim Constructions Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCA 201 at [25] to that of Handley JA and Foster AJA at [76]-[78]. 
     
      
    9 Further, the postulated intention is ephemeral. Even if ""in respect of which insurance is required ... "" qualifies ""use"", cover under insurance so required mayor may not turn only on use of the motor vehicle. In the present case, for example, the third party policy under s 10 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (""the Act"") did not do so. Because it provided cover against ""injury"", meaning injury as defined in the Act, in addition to use (or operation) there had to be driving, a collision etc. Thus on any view there was a gap between the cover under the compulsory third party policy and the cover under Policy 9.  
     
      
    10 Clause ii. in exclusion 1.b., referring to the use of any Vehicle ""which is otherwise insured by a person other than you in respect of the same liability"", most naturally qualifies ""Vehicle"" rather than ""use"" (or ""claims""). So also must clause i. If it then be asked whether the Landcruiser was a vehicle in respect of which insurance was required by legislation relating to the registration of motor vehicles, the answer is yes. The exclusion is thus enlivened.  
     
      
    11 For the exclusion to apply it is necessary also that Mr Kull's claim arose directly or indirectly out of or was caused by or in connection with ""the use of' the Landcruiser.  
     
      
    12 The Government Insurance Office of New South Wales v King (1960) 104 CLR 93 was concerned with bodily injury ""caused by or arising out of the use of an insured motor vehicle"", and distinguished between using a motor vehicle and putting it in order for some subsequent use. The facts were different from those of the present case; work had been done on the engine, the defendant was trying to start it, and it was not established that he was trying to start it preparatory to driving the motor vehicle as distinct from testing the efficacy of the work. In the present case turning the ignition key was part of Mr Maloney's endeavours to start a motor vehicle which had broken down in the course of a journey, bringing into play the observation of Menzies J (at 101) in The Government Insurance Office of New South Wales v King that the case was -  
     
      
       
        
        "" ... quite different from one where a car breaks down in traffic and attempts are then made to get it going again. In such a case, the attempts to start it might well, on the view I have taken, be regarded as part of the use of the car.""  
        
       
      
    13 The line between doing work on a motor vehicle and using it can be difficult to draw, but a narrow scope of ""use"" in the policy does not sit well with the exception to the exclusion, which indicates that loading or unloading is regarded as use of a vehicle. This reminds of Government Insurance Office (New South Wales) v R J Green v Lloyd Pty Ltd (1955) 114 CLR 437, in which it was so held. Windeyer J said in that case (at 446-7) that ""[a]ny use that is not utterly foreign to its character as a motor vehicle is, I consider, covered by the words [use of a motor vehicle]"". In Dickinson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust (1987) 163 CLR 500 the occupation of a motor vehicle by children as passengers while it was stationary was held to be a use of the vehicle, and it was said (at 505) that use for the purposes of the legislation ""extends to everything that fairly falls within the conception of the use of a motor vehicle and may include a use that does not involve locomotion"". The width of the conception caused the legislature to confine it by the Motor Accidents Amendment Act 1995, see Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GSF Australia Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 385 esp at [80]-[81]. It remains unconfined in the policy.  
     
      
    14 In my view, turning the ignition key as part of attempting to restart the broken down Landcruiser in the course of a journey was, while not driving it, using it within exclusion 1.b. Mr Kull's claim arose out of that use.  
     
      
    15 Mr Maloney is therefore not entitled to indemnity under Policy 9.  
     
      
       
      Orders  
      
    16 I propose the orders -  
     
      
      1. Appeal and cross-appeal allowed.  
       
      2. Set aside the verdict for the plaintiff against the defendant for $178,788 and in lieu thereof verdict for $118,788 to take effect on 29 November 2004.  
       
      3. Set aside the order that the cross-defendant indemnify the defendant and the order that it pay the defendant's costs and the costs payable by him to the plaintiff and in lieu thereof dismiss the cross-claim with costs.  
       
      4. Appellant and cross-appellant pay one half of the costs of the first respondent/first cross-respondent; second respondent pay the costs of the appellant and have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if otherwise eligible.  
       
      
    17 HODGSON JA: On 29 November 2004, Twigg ADCJ gave his decision in proceedings in which the first respondent (Mr. Kull) sued the second respondent (Mr. Maloney) for damages for personal injury, and Mr. Maloney cross-claimed against the appellant (AMP) seeking indemnity in respect of any verdict and costs recovered by Mr. Kull in the proceedings. The primary judge gave a verdict for Mr. Kull in the sum of $178,788.00, and ordered Mr. Maloney to pay Mr. Kull’s costs; and found for Mr. Maloney on the cross-claim, ordering that AMP indemnify him for the sum of $178,788.00 and pay his costs of the proceedings, including costs payable by him to Mr. Kull.  
     
      
    18 AMP appeals to this Court from those orders; and Mr. Maloney has put on a cross-appeal challenging the orders made against him.  
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    19 Mr. Kull was born in 1943. At the time of the accident giving rise to the proceedings, he was living at Mittagong. Prior to 1980, he had conducted a transport and mechanical repair business with his brother. After 1980, Mr. Kull’s brother continued to own and conduct the transport yard and Mr. Kull lived in a caravan on the site. Between 1980 and the date of the accident, Mr. Kull did some mechanical repairs, with some part-time driving and some selling of trucks. 
     
      
    20 On the evening of 15 February 2000, at about 10.00pm or 10.30pm, Mr. Kull was at home in his caravan, drinking a beer, when he heard a continuous clicking noise coming from outside his caravan. He walked through the transport yard to the front gate onto the road, where he saw two motor vehicles – a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to Mr. Maloney, and a Nissan FW belonging to a Mr. Ireland – parked nose to nose with their bonnets open and jumper leads joining the two vehicles, apparently to re-charge a battery. Both men were known to Mr. Kull.  
     
      
    21 At some earlier time, Mr. Maloney’s vehicle had broken down adjacent to the property where Mr. Kull’s caravan stood. When Mr. Kull arrived, it still would not start. Mr. Kull told Mr. Maloney about a fault in Land Cruiser circuits and offered the advice that the fault could be fixed by moving the fan belt a millimetre. Mr. Maloney indicated acceptance of that advice. Mr. Kull then leant under the bonnet and put his right hand on the fan belt in order to make the adjustment. Mr. Kull was standing alongside the vehicle on the driver’s side, and Mr. Maloney was also standing on the same side. To effect the operation proposed by Mr. Kull, it was not necessary to start up the engine, but only to re-position the fan belt. 
     
      
    22 While the bonnet was still up and the jumper leads still in place, Mr. Maloney turned the ignition key, located on the steering column, while he was still standing outside the Land Cruiser. He did this without warning, and without any request from Mr. Kull either to take or not to take that action. As a result, the fan belt moved and Mr. Kull’s right hand became jammed in the fan belt mechanism. The first three fingers of Mr. Kull’s right hand were seriously injured, requiring partial amputation of the index finger. 
     
      
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    23 The case requires reference to certain provisions of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act).  
     
      
    24 The definitions in s.3 of the Act include the following definitions of “driver”, “injury”, “motor accident” and “use or operation”:

        (b) in the case of a motor vehicle that is not a trailer—the use or operation of a trailer attached to the motor vehicle and a trailer running out of control having become detached from the motor vehicle towing it, or 
         
        (c) in the case of a motor vehicle that is a tow truck—the use or operation of an uninsured motor vehicle that is being towed or carried by the tow truck. 
        
       
      
    25 Section 8 and 10 of the Act provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        8 Offence of using uninsured motor vehicle on road 
         
        (1) A person who:  
         
        (a) uses a motor vehicle that is not an insured motor vehicle on a road, or 
         
        (b) causes or permits another person to use such a motor vehicle on a road, 
         
        is guilty of an offence.  
         
         
        (2) It is a defence to proceedings for an offence against this section if the defendant establishes that at the time the motor vehicle was used on the road the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing and did in fact believe that the motor vehicle was an insured motor vehicle. 
         
         
        10 Third-party policies 
         
        A third-party policy under this Act is a policy that is in the following terms:  
         
         Third-party Policy 
         
        The insurer insures the owner of the motor vehicle and any other person who at any time drives the vehicle (whether or not with the consent of the owner) against liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the vehicle:  
         
        (a) if the motor vehicle is not one to which paragraph (b) applies - in the use or operation of the vehicle in any part of the Commonwealth (whether or not on a road), or  
         
        (b) if the motor vehicle is subject to an unregistered vehicle permit under the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997 - in the use or operation of the vehicle on any road in any part of the Commonwealth.  
         
        In this policy, words and expressions have the same meanings as in the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999. 
        
       
      
    26 Mr. Maloney sought to place some reliance on s.45(1) of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        45(1) Where a provision included in a contract of general insurance has the effect of limiting or excluding the liability of the insurer under the contract by reason that the insured has entered into some other contract of insurance, not being a contract required to be effected by or under a law, including a law of a State or Territory, the provision is void. 
        
       
       
      THE INSURANCE POLICIES 
      
    27 Mr. Maloney claimed indemnity from AMP under two policies included in a Farm Insurance Contract which incorporated a number of different policies. The two relevant policies were Policy 8 (Motor Vehicles – Farm Vehicles) and Policy 9 (Public Liability). Policy 8 was expressed to cover “the Farm Vehicles in the Schedule”, of which there were nine, namely three tractors, two bailers, two rakes, a slasher and a plough. Section A1 of the policy covered loss or damage to each Farm Vehicle. Section A2 covered property and accidental bodily injury liability, and Section A3 covered certain law costs.  
     
      
    28 In relation to accidental bodily injury, there was no insurance cover unless the injury was “caused by or through or arising out of the use of the Vehicle other than in circumstances for which insurance is required by law under a compulsory statutory insurance scheme”.  
     
      
    29 Sections A4 and A6 of Policy 8 were in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        SECTION A4 - USING OTHER MOTOR VEHICLES 
         
        If you are using a motor vehicle other than the Vehicle and providing the Vehicle is NOT then in use, we will insure you against any or loss arising only under Sections A2 and A3 of this Policy to the limit only and in accordance with the provisions as set out in those Sections. The cover in this Section extends only to one substitute motor vehicle and is subject to the terms and conditions generally of this Policy.  
         
         
        SECTION A6 - REPLACEMENT VEHICLE COVER 
         
        If you sell the Vehicle and replace it with another motor vehicle, we will extend cover to you as provided by Sections A1 and A2 of this Policy to the extent that the replacement motor vehicle will be and become the Vehicle provided that:  
         
        a. you notify us in writing as to full details of the replacement motor vehicle within fourteen days of acquiring it; 
         
        b. you pay to us any additional premium which we require within fourteen days of being notified as to the amount. 
        
       
      
    30 Policy 9 covered certain legal liability for bodily injury, with exclusions including exclusion 1, which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        We shall  
        NOT 
         pay for any claims: 
         
        1. Arising directly or indirectly out of or caused by or in connection with: 
         
        a. the use of any lift, elevators, escalator, aircraft or aerial device in your physical or legal control or used in work undertaken by you or on your behalf; 
         
        b. the use of any Vehicle: 
         
          
          i. in respect of which insurance is required by any legislation relating to the registration of motor vehicles; 
           
          ii. which is otherwise insured by a person other than you in respect of the same liability; 
           
          This Exclusion 1.b. shall not apply to any claim caused by or from the delivery or collection of goods to or from any Vehicle where the injury or damage occurs beyond the limits of any roadway or arises out of the loading or unloading of or the delivery or collection of goods to or from any Vehicle used in work undertaken by you or on your behalf but which is not in your physical or legal control; 
          
         
        c. the ownership, possession or use by you or on your behalf of any watercraft while afloat, aircraft or aerial device. 
        
       
      
    31 In relation to these policies, there were the following agreed facts: 
     
      
       
        
        RE POLICY 8 
         
        1. That Vehicle PMM-009 was, at the time of Mr. Kull’s accident, being used in connection with the occupation or business of Mr. Maloney. 
         
        2. That the Vehicles listed on the Schedule to Policy 8 were not in use at the time of Mr. Kull’s accident. 
         
         
        RE POLICY 9 
         
        3. Subject to the argument that there is no indemnity because Mr. Kull’s accident is a motor accident, AMP concedes that, BUT FOR EXCLUSION 1b, the defendant is entitled to indemnity. 
        
       
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    32 A central question before the primary judge was whether the injury in respect of which Mr. Kull claimed damages was an “injury “ within the Act: if it was, then it was common ground that Mr. Kull had failed to comply with the requirements of that Act, so that the proceedings must fail. Then, there were the ordinary issues of whether Mr. Kull established that his injury was caused by the negligence of Mr. Maloney, whether he was guilty of contributory negligence, and the quantum of damages. Finally, there was the question of whether Mr. Maloney was entitled to an indemnity under either Policy 8 or Policy 9. 
     
      
    33 Neither Mr. Maloney nor Mr. Ireland gave evidence, although they were available to do so.  
     
      
    34 The primary judge was unable to determine what Mr. Maloney’s intention was in turning the ignition on, that is, whether he was intending to drive or was testing the repair. The judge was left in doubt as to when the repairs to the vehicle had been completed, that is, whether the vehicle was in the process of being repaired at the time when Mr. Maloney turned the ignition on or whether repairs had been completed. He was unable to conclude that the engine started and “ran”. When Mr. Kull’s hand became jammed in the fan belt, Mr. Kull called to Mr. Maloney to turn the engine off.  
     
      
    35 As to whether there was an injury within the meaning of the Act, the primary judge held that, although Mr. Maloney was the owner and driver of the Land Cruiser, his actions did not amount to driving or attempting to drive it; and he held there was no collision. Accordingly, the injury did not fall within either par.(i) or par.(ii) of the definition of “injury” in s.3 of the Act; and accordingly the Act did not apply. 
     
      
    36 On the question of negligence, the primary judge found that Mr. Kull’s injury was caused by the negligence of Mr. Maloney who, without warning Mr. Kull, turned the ignition key to test if the jamming of the fan belt had not been freed by Mr. Kull’s actions. (Mr. Kull was not in fact freeing a jammed fan belt, but that does not matter.) He was unable to find any contributory negligence by Mr. Kull. He held it was not negligence not to have asked Mr. Maloney not to interfere with the mechanism of the vehicle: Mr. Kull was entitled to expect that Mr. Maloney would remain standing alongside the vehicle until he had completed the repair, and removed his body entirely from under the bonnet. 
     
      
    37 As regards the cross-claim against AMP, the primary judge held that Mr. Maloney was entitled to an indemnity under Policy 8. He held that because the injury was not an injury under the Act, the vehicle was being used other than in circumstances for which insurance was required by law under a compulsory insurance scheme. In circumstances where the vehicles in the Schedule were not being used, the judge held that the Land Cruiser was “a motor vehicle other than the Vehicle” within s.A4 of Policy 8. 
     
      
    38 Having found that Mr. Maloney was entitled to an indemnity under Policy 8, he made no findings in relation to Policy 9. 
     
      
    39 As regards damages, the primary judge found out-of-pocket expenses to be $135.00 and non-economic loss to be $78,653.00 including interest. No challenge is made to these elements.  
     
      
    40 In relation to economic loss, Mr. Kull gave no evidence in chief as to his pre-accident earnings. In cross-examination, he agreed that his taxable income, as shown in his tax returns for the years ended June 1998 and 1999, was $4,000.00: however, these tax returns were not put into evidence. Evidence was given in Mr. Kull’s case by two witnesses concerning amounts paid to Mr. Kull for maintaining motor vehicles: a Dr. Mayman estimated that he paid Mr. Kull between $10,000.00 and $12,000.00 per year in the five years preceding the accident to service and repair large farm vehicles, such work costing him since the accident up to $20,000.00 per year; and a Mr. McMurray, a haulage contractor, estimated that in the five years preceding the accident he paid Mr. Kull an average of $20,000.00 per year. The primary judge estimated Mr. Kull’s pre-accident earning capacity as: declared income $8,000.00; casual repairs (gross) $35,000.00; sub-total $43,000.00; less expenses, tax and penalties $25,000.00; giving $18,000.00 or about $320.00 net per week. He assessed Mr. Kull’s past economic loss for 250 weeks at $320.00 per week, giving $80,000.00.  
     
      
    41 As for future economic loss, the judge considered Mr. Kull may have continued to do mechanical work on heavy vehicles of local citizens for many years beyond the age of 65; but that his willingness to overcome his injury meant that he might have some capacity to earn in other occupations. Using an earning capacity of $320.00 per week, mitigated by the possibility of other income, the judge awarded Mr. Kull a buffer of $20,000.00 for future economic loss. 
     
      
       
      ISSUES ON APPEAL 
      
    42 AMP contended that the Act applied, so that Mr. Kull’s proceedings should have failed. AMP also contended that there should have been a reduction of damages for contributory negligence, and that the primary judge erred in assessment of economic loss. AMP was supported in these contentions by Mr. Maloney.  
     
      
    43 AMP also contended that the primary judge erred in finding for Mr. Maloney on Policy 8. Mr. Maloney contended that the primary judge was correct on this, and also submitted that he was entitled to an indemnity under Policy 9.  
     
      
    44 I will consider in turn the following issues: the application of the Act; contributory negligence; Policy 8; Policy 9; and economic loss. 
     
      
       
      APPLICATION OF THE ACT 
       
      Submissions 
      
    45 Mr. Russell SC for AMP submitted that the fault of Mr. Maloney was “in the use or operation of the vehicle” within the definition of “injury” in the Act. The case of Government Insurance Office of NSW v. King (1960) 104 CLR 93, in which a distinction was drawn between use of a motor vehicle on the one hand, and putting a motor vehicle in order for subsequent use on the other, concerned different legislation: and even if activating the starter motor was not use of the motor vehicle, it was plainly operation of the motor vehicle, and in any event was within the extended definition of “use or operation” in the Act.  
     
      
    46 Mr. Russell also submitted that the injury was a result of and caused during the driving of the vehicle. One can be the driver of a motor vehicle even if one is not in the driver’s seat of the vehicle (Ricketts v. Laws (1988) 14 NSWLR 311) and even if one merely activates the starter motor from outside the vehicle (Shortland County Council v. Government Insurance Office of NSW [1973] 2 NSWLR 257, Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd. v. AAMI Ltd. [1999] NSWCA 200, 29 MVR 393 at [22], AMP General Insurance Ltd. v. Maguire [2004] NSWCA 64, 59 NSWLR 580). Mr. Russell submitted that the driving of a vehicle commences when one prepares to start the vehicle, even before activating the starter motor: Insurance Commissioner of Western Australia v. Container Handlers Pty. Ltd. [2004] HCA 24, 218 CLR 89 at [153]. He submitted it was not necessary that the vehicle be moving: QBE Insurance (Aust) Ltd. v. Smith [2005] NSWCA 130. In this case, if the accident had not occurred, Mr. Maloney could have proceeded immediately to drive away.  
     
      
    47 Alternatively, Mr. Russell submitted, the injury was a result of and caused during a collision with the vehicle, namely the collision between Mr. Kull’s hand and the fan belt mechanism.  
     
      
       
       
      Decision 
      
    48 It is common ground that the injury to Mr. Kull was caused by the fault of the owner of the relevant motor vehicle, that is, Mr. Maloney. In my opinion, the relevant fault was in the operation of the motor vehicle, because activation of the starter motor did involve operation of the motor vehicle. It is unnecessary to decide whether this would also amount to use of the motor vehicle, or whether it falls within the definition of “use or operation” because it was part of maintenance of the vehicle.  
     
      
    49 However, in my opinion the injury was plainly not a result of and caused during the driving of the motor vehicle. The motor vehicle was parked nose to nose with another motor vehicle, both with bonnets open, and attached by jumper leads. Activation of the starter motor occurred after Mr. Kull told Mr. Maloney that the fault in his motor vehicle could be fixed by moving the fan belt, and placed his hand on the fan belt to make the adjustment. Mr. Maloney was standing beside the door of the vehicle. In the absence of evidence from Mr. Maloney, it would have been wrong to infer in those circumstances that Mr. Maloney activated the motor as part of a process of setting off in the vehicle, and the primary judge did not do so.  
     
      
    50 The case is different from Shortland County Council and Maguire because in those cases the activation of the starter motor caused the motor vehicle to move, and in those circumstances it was reasonable to hold that the motor vehicle was driven. It is also different from QBE v. Smith, because in that case the motor vehicle was stationary because of a pause in the course of a continuous process of driving.  
     
      
    51 It may be, as suggested in Container Handlers at [153], that activating a starter motor with a view to setting off in a vehicle can be considered driving, or at least the commencement of driving. However, this is not what happened in this case. Although the primary judge could not draw a definite conclusion as to what Mr. Maloney’s intention was, it seems clear that at least part of his intention was to check if the motor would now start. Even if he had in mind getting into the driver’s seat and setting off, this could not happen until the jumper leads had been removed and the bonnet shut. It is not clear whether or not the jumper leads could have been safely removed with the engine running, but it does not matter. In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, the operation of the starter motor was too far removed from actually driving off in the vehicle to count as being part of the driving of the vehicle. 
     
      
    52 The other question is whether the injury was the result of and caused during a collision with the vehicle. In my opinion, to call the contact of Mr. Kull’s hand with the fan belt mechanism “a collision with the vehicle” would be a significant departure from the natural meaning of the phrase: cf. Townsville Trade Waste Pty. Ltd. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd. [1999] QCA 386, 29 MVR 503. The contact of a pedestrian with a stationary vehicle could possibly fall within that expression; and such a collision could be with an appendage to the vehicle, such as a wing mirror. But there at least has to be injury caused by an impact that can fairly be described as a collision with the vehicle, that is, an impact due to the mutual motion of whatever collides with the vehicle and the vehicle itself. A hand being drawn into a fan belt mechanism does not in my opinion amount to a collision of the hand, or the person whose hand it is, with the vehicle.

    53 Mr. Russell submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr. Kull said he had found he had to be careful to make sure that an unqualified person did not turn on a motor when he had his hands on the motor working on it; and that on the night in question, he did not know where Mr. Maloney was when he had his hands in the engine bay. Mr. Russell submitted that a reasonable man in the position of Mr. Kull would have made sure that he either warned Mr. Maloney that he was about the put his hands inside the engine bay, or would have made sure that no-one was in a position to turn the engine on when Mr. Kull was working on it. Accordingly, Mr. Kull’s damages should be reduced, Mr. Russell submitting that 50% was an appropriate figure.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    54 In circumstances where Mr. Kull had said that the fault could be fixed by moving the fan belt and Mr. Maloney assented to this, and where Mr. Kull then set about doing this with Mr. Maloney standing nearby outside the vehicle, in my opinion Mr. Kull could reasonably expect that Mr. Maloney would not activate the starter motor, at least not without clear warning. Accordingly, I do not think the primary judge was in error in not finding contributory negligence.  
     
      
       
      POLICY 8 
       
      Submissions 
      
    55 Mr. Russell submitted that Policy 8 disclosed an intention that farm vehicles be covered; and the purpose of Section A4 of the policy was to provide for the situation where a farm vehicle specified in the Schedule was not in use, and a vehicle of a similar kind was being used in its place; for example, where a tractor had broken down and another tractor was borrowed. This was confirmed by the use of the expression “substitute vehicle”. None of the vehicles in the Schedule was a road vehicle; and the Land Cruiser was not being used in place of any of the vehicles in the Schedule.  
     
      
    56 Mr. Russell also submitted that the Land Cruiser was not being used “other than in circumstances for which insurance was required by law under a compulsory statutory insurance scheme”. The Land Cruiser was being used on a road, and s.8 of the Act made it an offence to use a motor vehicle that was not insured on a road.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    57 Although Policy 8 is expressed to be for farm vehicles, and although the vehicles in the schedule did not include road vehicles, Section A4 in its terms simply refers to “using a motor vehicle other than the Vehicle”, providing that the Vehicle is not then in use; the Vehicle meaning one of the vehicles in the Schedule. In my opinion, the use of the word “substitute vehicle” is insufficient to carry the requirement that the vehicle “other than” the Vehicle in the Schedule be of the same kind or used for the same purpose as the vehicle that is not in use. Such a requirement would raise difficult questions of degree which are not addressed in the provisions. The wording of Section A4 is quite different from that of Section A6, where an intention is disclosed that a vehicle be replaced; and even there, the replacing vehicle does not have to be the same kind. 
     
      
    58 At worst for Mr. Maloney, there is ambiguity here; and in circumstances of ambiguity, the contra proferentem principle can apply: Darlington Futures Ltd. v. Delco Australia Pty. Ltd. (1986) 161 CLR 500.  
     
      
    59 In my opinion also, Mr. Maloney’s Land Cruiser was not being used in circumstances for which insurance was required under a compulsory insurance scheme. Insurance is required for use of a motor vehicle on a road; and in my opinion repair of a motor vehicle, and activation of its starter motor in the course of repair and not as the commencement of driving of the motor vehicle, is not use of a motor vehicle on a road within s.8 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. In that Act, “use”, as distinct from “use or operation”, is not defined; and in relation to use, the distinction drawn in King between use of a motor vehicle and preparation for use is apposite.  
     
      
    60 Accordingly, in my opinion Mr. Maloney is entitled to indemnity under Policy 8. 
     
      
       
      POLICY 9 
       
      Submissions 
      
    61 Mr. Russell submitted that the words “in respect of which insurance is required by any legislation relating to the registration of motor vehicles” applied to the word “Vehicle”, not “use” or “any claims”: it is not a normal use of language to refer to “use” or “any claims” being insured, and this was confirmed by the reference to “otherwise insured” in the following paragraph. The Land Cruiser, being a vehicle used on the road, was a vehicle in respect of which insurance was required by legislation relating to the registration of motor vehicles.  
     
      
    62 Mr. Watson SC for Mr. Maloney submitted that the clear intention of Policy 9, like Policy 8, was to provide cover against claims not covered by compulsory motor vehicle insurance: cf. HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd. v. Pluim Constructions Pty. Ltd. [2000] NSWCA 281 at [75]-[78]. Mr. Watson also submitted that s.45 of the Insurance Contracts Act prevented liability being excluded.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    63 In my opinion, s.45 of the Insurance Contracts Act can have no application: Policy 9 contains no provision having the effect of limiting or excluding liability by reason of the insured having entered into some other contract of insurance.  
     
      
    64 I agree that it is reasonable to think the intention of the policy was to cover the insured against claims arising from the use of a motor vehicle which claims were not covered by compulsory motor vehicle insurance. I agree also, as suggested by Pluim, that the construction of such a clause should not be governed by the terms of the legislation dealing with compulsory insurance that happens to be in force in New South Wales at any particular time. However, it is necessary to construe the words actually used, and I do not think that the terms of the applicable legislation are irrelevant. 
     
      
    65 Registration is required for a vehicle used on a road or road-related area, with certain exceptions: Road Traffic (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997, s.18. Insurance in terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act is required to obtain registration: Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Regulation 1998, reg.11. As we have seen, compulsory insurance is required in respect of vehicles used on roads: s.8 of the Act.  
     
      
    66 I do not think the wording of Policy 9 is such that one can apply “in respect of” to claims. However, those words could apply either to “use” or “Vehicle”. It is closer to the inferred intention of the provision that it apply to “use”; and there being some ambiguity here also, this conclusion is supported by the contra proferentem approach.  
     
      
    67 In my opinion, the claim in this case does not arise directly out of the use of the Land Cruiser in respect of which insurance is required for registration, nor do I think it was caused by such use: this follows from what I said in relation to Policy 8. There may be some question whether it arises “indirectly” from such use, or is caused “in connection with” such use. The relevant use would be the use by Mr. Maloney of the Land Cruiser before it broke down. However, even if the claim can be considered as arising indirectly from, or in connection with, the breaking down of the vehicle, in my opinion it did not arise indirectly from the use preceding the breaking down, nor was it caused in connection with that prior use. Again, in so far as there is any ambiguity, the contra proferentem principle would support this result.  
     
      
    68 Accordingly, Mr. Maloney is entitled to a indemnity under Policy 9 as well as Policy 8.  
     
      
       
      DAMAGES 
       
      Submissions 
      
    69 Mr. Russell submitted there was a number of errors in the judgment of the primary judge concerning economic loss. The income declared in the tax returns was $4,000.00, not $8,000.00. The other income totalled $30,000.00 or $32,000.00, not $35,000.00. The primary judge did not justify adding this amount to the declared amount. Furthermore, Mr. Russell submitted, Mr. Kull had said in evidence that the $4,000.00 shown in his tax return was correct; and there was no evidence as to how much of $30,000.00 or $32,000.00 was covered by parts or other matters in respect of Mr. Kull incurred expense. Furthemore, there was evidence that Mr. Kull had a residual capacity, and was earning money from helping in his son’s business, this not being allowed for at all in respect of past economic loss.  
     
      
    70 Mr. Watson supported these submissions. He referred to what was said in Giorginis v. Kastrati (1988) 48 SASR 371 at 375-6, per von Doussa J: 
     
      
       
        
        But cases where the damages are, by the nature of the loss, difficult to calculate, are to be distinguished from cases, like the present, where precise calculation is rendered impossible, and even broad assessment difficult, not by the nature of the loss, but by a paucity of evidence where it is clear that it lies within the power of the plaintiff to produce business and taxation records usually maintained by people in employment or business or other evidence which could clarify the extent of his income.  
         
         
        Where the plaintiff gives evidence that his income tax returns do not disclose the full extent of his earnings, a court will scrutinise the plaintiff’s evidence with special care. The want of honest compliance with the taxation laws is a matter that will reflect adversely on the plaintiffs credit and may lead to the rejection of his evidence as untrustworthy, at least about his earnings. In such a case the plaintiff has only himself to blame if damages are assessed in line with the pre-accident income actually disclosed to the revenue authority. However, where the fact of the receipt of other income is proved, then, in my view, the plaintiff is entitled to have that exercise of his earning capacity brought to account, although subject to reduction for the income tax which should have been paid, and subject to the question whether the plaintiff would have continued to exercise that capacity had he been required to pay tax on the additional income: see  
        McIntosh v Williams  
        [1976] 2 NSWLR 237 at 244, 252.  
        Melino v Ken Eustice Motors (North Road) Pty Ltd  
        (1984) 111 LSJS 296 at 308-310 is an example of a case where undisclosed income was proved and brought to account.  
         
         
        A failure to disclose income as required by s 161 of the  
        Income Tax Assessment Act  
        1936, constitutes an offence which may attract heavy penalties: see s 223 of the  
        Income Tax Assessment Act  
        and ss 8C, 8K and 8P of the  
        Taxation Administration Act  
        1953. Where a tax fraud or evasion of this kind is disclosed in evidence, it is the court's duty to draw the evidence to the attention of the executive branch of government for such action as may be appropriate:  
        Petera Pty Ltd v EAJ Pty Ltd  
        (1984) 7 FCR 375. A court should not, generally speaking, make a finding favourable to the plaintiff in a personal injury case that his income is otherwise than he has disclosed to the revenue authority unless the plaintiff admits the non- disclosure. A fortiori, such a finding should not be made where the plaintiff denies that he has failed to properly disclose his income. Unless the plaintiff admits the falsity of his income tax returns the court should not speculate in his favour, for example that his pre-accident earnings were probably higher than he has disclosed. Rather, the court should adopt the income figures actually disclosed and base the assessment of damages on them. Again, if this results in a low assessment, that is the consequence of the plaintiff adhering to the accuracy of his income tax returns. 
        
       
       
      That passage was emphatically endorsed by King CJ and Legoe J at 379.  
       
      
    71 Mr. Watson also pointed out that the Counsel for Mr. Kull below had asked for past economic loss calculated at $100.00 per week, and later agreed with submissions for the other parties that it was appropriate to provide a buffer for past and future economic loss, submitting however that their suggested figure of $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 was at the bottom of the range.  
     
      
    72 Ms. Norton SC for Mr. Kull submitted that the admission made by Mr. Kull was in respect of a figure in his income tax return which was probably taxable income, and his acceptance of that figure in effect was a concession that his accountant had worked correctly from the papers given to him. It had to be understood along with his evidence that he was paid for much of his work in cash. Furthermore, there was no attempt in the cross-examination to link the figure of $4,000.00 to net income before deductions such as work-related deductions that were of value for living, superannuation, losses on investments, charitable donations, etc. Ms. Norton also referred to Trajkovski v. Ken’s Painting & Decorating Services Pty. Ltd. [2002] NSWSC 568 (Dunford J) at [51]-[52], as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        51 …  
        Giorginis v Kastrati 
         was referred to with approval by the Court of Appeal in  
        Brear v James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd  
        [2000] NSWCA 352, 50 NSWLR 388 at [52] but only to the extent that the trial judge was entitled to take into account the fact that the appellant had called no evidence about matters (relating to past income) upon which it might have been expected that he or witnesses called by him might cast light.  
         
         
        52 In these circumstances, where I consider it likely that the plaintiff had some income beyond that disclosed in his taxation returns, although he has not directly admitted submitting false returns, I assess the plaintiff’s loss of income by reference to what has been disclosed together with something for the additional income discounted for the tax that should have been paid on it; but because of the paucity of the evidence, the assessment must be conservative and not over generous. As there has been no direct admission of the lodging of the false taxation returns no question arises about referring the matter to the relevant authorities. I reject the submission that in a case such as this it is appropriate to take Average Weekly Earnings or any similar table as a guide. 
        
       
      
    73 Ms. Norton also submitted that the primary judge was not incorrect in allowing for economic loss on the basis of evidence from customers as to what they had paid him.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    74 In my opinion, the primary judge did make the errors identified by Mr. Russell. I agree with what was said in Giorginis v. Kastrati. I do not think the matters referred to by Ms. Norton could realistically indicate that Mr. Kull declared a net income substantially in excess of $4,000.00, which was reduced to that figure by deductions of the kind referred to. In my opinion also, error is indicated in that Mr. Kull asked for past economic loss at the rate of $100.00 per week: in those circumstances, the adoption of the figure of $320.00 by the primary judge, without any indication that he proposed to go well beyond the figure requested by Mr. Kull, indicates a denial of procedural fairness. 
     
      
    75 The onus is squarely on a plaintiff to prove economic loss, and the information concerning economic loss and documents relevant to it are within the knowledge and possession of the plaintiff, so the lack of clarity on such matters is primarily the responsibility of the plaintiff. In this case, however, the other parties had access to the income tax returns and chose not to tender them; so they too bear some responsibility for the circumstance that those documents were not in evidence. The lack of information about actual receipts by the plaintiff from his working for his son is entirely the responsibility of the plaintiff.  
     
      
    76 In those circumstances, in my opinion the award for economic loss must be set aside. Precision is not possible, and I would propose an award of $20,000.00 for past economic loss (an average of about $80.00 per week) and a $20,000.00 buffer for future economic loss, so that the judgment will be reduced by $60,000.00.  
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
      
    77 In my opinion, the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal and cross-appeal allowed to the extent of substituting, for the verdict of $178,788.00 for Mr. Kull against Mr. Maloney, a verdict of $118,788.00 to take effect on 29 November 2004.  
       
      2. Appeal and cross-appeal otherwise dismissed.  
       
      3. Order that AMP pay one-half of Mr. Maloney’s costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, and that otherwise each party bear its own costs of the appeal, with Mr. Kull to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act in respect of his own costs if otherwise eligible. 
       
      
    78 SANTOW JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. This is save as to his conclusion that Mr Maloney is entitled to an indemnity under Policy 8 where I agree with Giles JA.  
     
      
    79 Policy 9, in my opinion, applies. The exclusion should in my opinion be construed to cover the composite expression “the use of any Vehicle”. There was in my opinion no such use here, for the reasons stated by Hodgson JA. It follows that I agree with the orders he proposes.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: Moli Kaufusi was convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of 15 months. Mr Kaufusi appealed both the conviction and the sentence, but on hearing, has not sought to agitate leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 On 2 November 2002 the appellant, Mr Kaufusi, was dining with his girlfriend at a restaurant in Sydney. They started to argue. Mr Kaufusi had suggested that the couple separate and a heated argument ensued. The girlfriend, Ms Noble, threw a glass of wine at Mr Kaufusi and they left the restaurant and moved into the car park. In the car park Ms Noble attacked, both physically and verbally, Mr Kaufusi who retaliated. The physical altercation which ensued included Mr Kaufusi chasing Ms Noble, sitting on top of her and acting aggressively. He either banged her head against the concrete floor or hit her extremely hard in the head or both. It attracted the attention of people in neighbouring buildings and the incident was reported to the police. Mr Kaufusi and Ms Noble got into the car and drove towards Norton Street. After a short distance, Mr Kaufusi got out of the car and started walking away.  
     
      
    5 Ms Noble also got out of the car and attempted to seek assistance from passers by and was, ultimately, admitted to the backseat of a passing vehicle. One of the passengers in that vehicle spoke with her and observed blood on her clothing and head and, on inspection, the passenger and Ms Noble noticed that part of her ear was missing. It is recorded that Ms Noble told this person and, on the records, at a later time told a number of other people including an ambulance officer, a nurse, police officers and doctors, that Mr Kaufusi had bitten off part of her ear.  
     
      
    6 Mr Kaufusi was arrested nearby. At the time of his arrest he had blood on his clothing and the car, which had been abandoned, was seized by the police for examination. The police conducted searches for the severed portion of Ms Noble’s ear but it could not be found. Blood was found in the rear of the vehicle and in the car park area.  
     
      
    7 Independent witnesses testified to some, but not all of the above, including the aggressive manner of Mr Kaufusi, his banging of Ms Noble’s head against the concrete in the car park and the general mêlée. Some of the independent witnesses also testified that Ms Noble told them, at the time, that Mr Kaufusi had bitten off her ear.  
     
      
    8 The independent witnesses included the treating physician, the passenger in the car into which Ms Noble was taken and delivered to the hospital and two young women who were in the vicinity of the car park. (It is not here suggested that the two young women testified about the ear or any statement relating to it.) 
     
      
    9 At the hearing Ms Noble gave evidence on subpoena. She had previously refused to give a statement to the police in relation to the matter and resisted police attempts to serve her.  
     
      
    10 The issue of fact upon which the case turned was whether Mr Kaufusi had severed Ms Noble’s ear (or a portion of it) by biting it or whether, in accordance with the testimony by Ms Noble given for the first time at the hearing, that Ms Noble fell in the car park and the right side of her body hit the car window causing it to smash. It was, she said, at that time that she felt a sharp pain in the right side of her head but did not know exactly from where the pain was coming. It was Ms Noble’s evidence that the ear was severed by the glass of the window when it smashed. The smashing of the window was independently confirmed as occurring at that time but the wound, when treated, had no glass in it and, according to physicians, the wound was consistent with the ear having been bitten. It should be pointed out that there was no evidence to suggest that the wound was inconsistent with having been severed by glass, save for the absence of glass fragments in the wound or around the wound and, possibly, the level of force that would be required to cause the injury.  
     
      
    11 The question of fact as to whether the ear had been severed by Mr Kaufusi was an issue that was put to the jury and on which the jury came to a conclusion.  
     
      
    12 The trial judge, in his summation to the jury made the following comments in relation to these issues: 
     
      
       
        
        “The assault must be intentional, that is, it is not sufficient if it was simply an unintentional application of force. For example, some sort of accidental application of force or in circumstances, as I think Sherie Noble was intimating here, that she lost her balance and in that process she became injured. The application of force must be without the consent of the person to whom the application of force is applied. In this case, that was Sherie Noble. … 
        
       
       
        
        … Might I suggest something to you that I hope will assist you in reaching your decision. The case can perhaps factually be analysed in this way. You can ask yourselves this question, ‘Did the accused bite a portion of, the woman, Sherie Noble’s ear off during an altercation in the car park in Leichhardt?’ If you accept beyond reasonable doubt that he did, then that finding by you will assist you in finding the elements of the charge as I have indicated them for you. You still need to look at those elements and you still need to be satisfied about those elements beyond reasonable doubt. If, on the other hand, you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had bitten off that portion of Ms Noble’s ear, then you could not be satisfied of the elements of the offence and you would therefore acquit the accused. … 
        
       
       
        
        … What she was saying in her evidence was that if she was injured, it was not as a result of any act or intentional act on behalf of the accused, it was in effect because she initiated a fight with him and during the course of that fight she lost balance and hit her head against the car. …  
        
       
       
        
        … It was submitted to you that it is highly improbable that the ear, cut in the manner in which it was ultimately cut, was cut by the window in that car. There was no glass noted at the hospital in her ear or on her skin, it was physically unlikely that the only injury that would have occurred to her was the type of injury that did occur to her ear if that was what had caused her injury. … 
        
       
       
        
        … [Counsel for the accused submitted that] … you will have a reasonable doubt because Ms Noble came here and gave evidence, that she gave evidence in a way which it was submitted to you was impressive, she did not shy away from any of the questions asked in cross-examination and that, as a result of that, at the very least, you must have a doubt about which version is true. If you have a doubt, then you must give that doubt to the accused and it was submitted to you by [Counsel] that you will give that doubt to the accused and consequently find him not guilty of having committed any assault on the victim, Ms Noble, on this evening. …” 
        
       
      
    13 At the conclusion of the direction, the trial judge asked both the Crown and the counsel for the accused whether there were any matters on which either wanted the Court to address the jury. Each of them answered in the negative. It should be pointed out, further, that counsel for the accused had indicated prior to the summation, that the accused did not rely upon self-defence and counsel did not seek to address, or have the Court address, that issue.  
     
      
    14 The appellant raises two grounds on appeal: firstly, that there was a failure to direct the jury on self-defence; and, secondly, that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.  
     
      
       
      Ground One: Self-defence 
       
      
    15 As already stated, counsel for the appellant, after listening to the summation by the trial judge, sought to have no additional remarks made by the judge and, in particular, did not seek to have the issue of self-defence put to the jury by his Honour. Further, again as already stated, his Honour had enquired of defence counsel on the issue of self-defence. At transcript page 87 of 18 August 2004, immediately after the close of the evidence in the proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor sought and was granted a short adjournment before addressing and, prior to the adjournment and in the absence of the jury, his Honour asked the following question of counsel for the accused: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: There was one matter I wanted to think about and that was how am I to put the accused’s defence here, is it that it never happened, or is it that it happened in the way in which she said it. 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for accused]: That’s what we are relying on, Your Honour, and I will be saying that in my address. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: We just … be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt then you might accept Sherrie’s evidence and if you do then you have a reasonable doubt. The only reason I raise this is because  
        I was wondering whether or not you were relying on self-defence at all? 
        
       
       
        
        [Counsel for the accused]: No, not at all Your Honour, simply rely on her evidence that it didn’t happen and we argue that there is a reasonable doubt.” (emphasis is mine) 
        
       
      
    16 The mere fact that for tactical reasons defence counsel does not raise an issue at trial does not, in all cases, mean that the court does not have an independent duty to direct the jury in relation to matters. The overriding concern must be to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial. There are, in this case, obvious reasons why the defence counsel would not, himself, raise the issue of self-defence, given that the theory pressed on the jury by defence counsel was that the injury in question was not caused, at all, by the accused. In Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107, Barwick CJ (at 117-118) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt  
        bona fide 
         for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interests of the client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and to the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part. … 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to the matters he did raise. However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused.” 
        
       
      
    17 A trial judge is obliged to deal with self-defence in his directions to the jury only if there is evidence from which such a defence reasonably arises. (See also Mansini v DPP [1942] A.C.1 and Kwaku Mensah v The King [1946] A.C.83) 
     
      
    18 Self-defence is available if, and only if, the alleged offender believes the conduct is necessary, relevantly, to defend himself, and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceives them (see s.418 Crimes Act 1900). The onus of proof is on the Crown and it is required to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did not carry out the conduct in self-defence.  
     
      
    19 There is no evidence, in this case, which would even raise the reasonable possibility that the accused believed the biting of the ear was necessary to defend himself or that it was a reasonable response to any attack on him. Although some evidence, which was not accepted, was adduced to seek to prove that the ear was not bitten, no evidence was adduced in the proceedings, directly or through the cross-examination of witnesses, to the effect that the biting of the ear was necessary in self-defence. In order for the question of self-defence to have been put to the jury by the trial judge, self-defence must have been a hypothesis which had a rational basis on the material that was adduced in evidence. There is no requirement on a trial judge to put a hypothesis in summing up which is either fanciful or unrealistic (see Barca v The Queen (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 and R v Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 at 230-231). 
     
      
    20 During the course of the appeal hearing, Senior Counsel for Mr Kaufusi, in answer to a question as to the material relied upon to raise the possibility of this defence, made reference to evidence on the voir dire in which Ms Noble gave evidence on questioning by the Crown Prosecutor in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: How close did you get to him at the closest point during this fight? 
        
       
       
        
        A: As close as you can hit someone and I grabbed his testicles, I tried anything to – I was so angry, I was angry. I just couldn’t stop constantly just punching at him, anything I could do, kicking him.” 
        
       
      
    21 This evidence was never adduced in the trial and was not material before the jury on which they could deliberate. It has not been suggested, in any evidence, whether before the jury or on the voir dire, that the biting incident occurred as a result of Ms Noble grabbing Mr Kaufusi’s testicles. Indeed, Ms Noble continued to suggest that Mr Kaufusi did not bite her ear.  
     
      
    22 Evidence was adduced, without objection, that Ms Noble had said, contemporaneously, that the defendant had bitten off her ear and, ultimately, the jury was faced with two quite stark alternatives. The jury chose to believe the independent witnesses and the contemporaneous statements by Ms Noble and not believe Ms Noble in her version of events as given in court.  
     
      
    23 In the circumstances, there was no reasonable hypothesis, on the evidence, consistent with self-defence. It was not necessary for the judge to put self-defence to the jury and no miscarriage of justice has occurred in relation to that matter. The trial was, in the relevant legal sense, a fair trial and this ground fails.  
     
      
       
      Rule 4: Criminal Appeal Rules 
       
      
    24 I have reached the above conclusion without any reference to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
    25 Where the facts before the jury and the principles in Pemble together require the trial judge to direct the jury on self-defence, the operation of Rule 4 becomes significant. The procedure is not a mere technicality to be ignored when it suits. (R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536 D-F) One of its purposes is to ensure that the trial judge gains the assistance of counsel in the directions to jury. The right to a fair trial does not include the right to a new trial because a party does not take full advantage of opportunities that were available. In this case counsel did not raise objection to any part of the direction or seek to have self-defence raised. More significantly counsel deliberately eschewed any reliance on self-defence and any requirement for the trial judge to sum up on the basis that it formed any part of the defence of the accused below. (See [15] infra) 
     
      
    26 In those circumstances there is no miscarriage of justice associated with the lack of the direction; there is no arguable case; and there has not been shown to be an error of law. Given the earlier determination as to the merit of the ground sought to be raised, it is unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal to deal with leave sought under Rule 4. However, I would, in the current circumstances, have denied such leave.  
     
      
       
      Ground Two: The Verdict is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence 
       
      
    27 On appeal it is submitted that the verdict is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. This ground depends, in part, upon evidence given by Ms Noble about the time delay in the realisation of the injury to her ear. The evidence is best summarised in the following passage of transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: And do you see that the entry starts off ‘21 year old female’ … and then it says ‘right ear helix and scapha bitten off by boyfriend’? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yeah, I see that written. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And then it says ‘Patient didn’t realise for 30 minutes until told’? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yep.” (transcript 17.08.04 page 22-23) 
        
       
       
        
        “Q: The next note is ‘patient didn’t realise for 30 minutes until told’? 
        
       
       
        
        A: That is correct.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: Do you recall that? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yes  
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did you tell the doctor that? 
        
       
       
        
        A: I may have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: At what point in time did you know that your ear had been severed? 
        
       
       
        
        A: When they told me in the car, when I was in the car with all the people.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: The people in the car told you? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yeah because there was blood there and I was just so wound up and angry at the time I didn’t, I didn’t know what was wrong, I knew there was a pain there but I didn’t know exactly where it was coming from.” (Transcript 17.08.05 pp 36-37) 
        
       
      
    28 The above evidence was consistent with the evidence given by the independent witness in the car who, in effect, testified that he noticed blood, enquired of Ms Noble and the severing of her ear was discovered. However, with due respect to the argument put, the evidence nowhere suggests that the witness was, in making that statement, unaware that her ear had been bitten. The state of knowledge to which that evidence goes was the damage that had been done by the biting incident as described contemporaneously by Ms Noble. Counsel for the appellant suggests that the jury ought to have expressed a reasonable doubt and acquitted the appellant and cites M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 in support. The issue is one which depends upon the proper application of s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which was considered by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. The joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ states that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported, the test to be applied is that stated by the majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in M in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law, there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” ( 
        M v The Queen 
         at 493 cited with approval in  
        MFA 
         at 615) 
        
       
      
    29 The other joint judgment in MFA (McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) also adopted the test in M describing it in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[55] Nevertheless, in  
        M 
        , the majority of this Court favoured what might be termed a ‘broader’ test for unreasonableness or un-supportability of a verdict. Instead of asking whether a jury ‘must’ or were ‘bound to’ have a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was ‘open to the jury’ to be satisfied of the accused’s guilt applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict ‘upon the whole of the evidence’.” 
        
       
      
    30 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act qualifies the symbolic acceptance of the verdict of a jury as the final determination of guilt or innocence (MFA at 621 [48]). This is so because, in the context of a criminal trial, the requirement for finality of factual assessment by a jury must be qualified by the importance of the liberty of the individual and the fundamental requirement of the criminal justice system to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is these two issues, finality of the verdict of a jury on the one hand and, on the other hand, the importance of the liberty of the individual that are reconciled by the provisions of s.6(1); which issues are the subject of the discussion in both M and MFA. The functions exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal under s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act are ‘designed to afford a mechanism against a prospect that our community and its courts continue to regard as intolerable, namely that an innocent person has been wrongly convicted upon unreasonable and unsupported evidence and has thereby suffered a miscarriage of justice. The interpretation and application of the sub-section must always keep that purpose in mind. But it involves a function to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials.’ (MFA at 624 [59]) 
     
      
    31 The jury had before them inconsistent statements by Ms Noble. They must have chosen not to believe the later statements. The jury was entitled so to do and accept the evidence given by the independent witnesses. No basis for the intervention of this Court has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    32 For these reasons the appeal fails. I propose: 
     
      
    a Leave to appeal against sentence be refused;b Appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I generally agree with the reasons of Rothman J which I have had the advantage of reading in draft. 
     
      
    2 His Honour refers to the difficulties which s.21A has provoked on a number of occasions when sentences are being imposed. Although the section has proved useful in many cases it is important that the sentencing judge carefully identify the elements of the offence so that they are not also considered as an aggravating factor contrary to s 21A(2). 
     
      
    3 With respect to the relevance of prior convictions I identified in R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368 that the recent and consistent approach of this Court was that they could be relevant only to subjective matters. However, the matter may not be without controversy and may require further consideration in an appropriate case (see [2] and [30]-[34] in Hathaway). It may be necessary to consider the correct understanding of the joint judgment in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 165 CLR 465 at 477. 
     
      
    4 In the present matter Andrew ADCJ twice refers to the fact that the applicant “had previous convictions”. Although not entirely clear it is tolerably plain that his Honour had in mind that the applicant’s record was an aggravating feature of the relevant offences. The present state of the authorities would suggest that, if his Honour, adopted this view he was in error. However, as I pointed out in Hathaway even if, in this respect, his Honour erred it is necessary to give careful consideration to whether this has lead to a sentence being imposed which would cause this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    5 As the Chief Justice pointed out in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 imposes the obligation on this Court, if error is identified, to nevertheless consider whether some other sentence to that which was imposed is warranted in law. 
     
      
    6 In the present case the various offences related by Rothman J and the matters on the Form 1 reveal a serious collection of offences more than justifying the sentences which the sentencing judge imposed. 
     
      
    7 I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J. 
     
      
    8 HISLOP J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    9 ROTHMAN J: DBN was sentenced for nine offences under 2 indictments. The first indictment consisted of the counts for taking and driving conveyance in contravention of s.154A of the Crimes Act 1900; aggravated break and enter with intent to steal (in company) in contravention of s.113(2) of the Crimes Act. Two counts of malicious damage contrary to s.195(a) of the Crimes Act; and in the alternative to count two a count of aggravated attempt break enter and steal contrary to s.112(2) and s.344A of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    10 The second indictment was for robbery in company contrary to s.97(1) of the Crimes Act; aggravating stealing from the person, contrary to s.95(1) of the Crimes Act; steal from the person contrary to s.94 of the Crimes Act; a further count of steal from the person contrary to s.94 of the Crimes Act; and a third count of steal from the person contrary to s.94 of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    11 DBN pleaded not guilty to all of the charges (including the alternate charge) in indictment one and pleaded guilty to all of the charges in indictment two.  
     
      
    12 DBN was convicted of all except the alternative count in the first indictment and was sentenced for all matters at the one time by his Honour Acting Judge Andrew of the District Court. His Honour was asked to take into account, and did, a number of offences contained in a Form One being twelve offences of steal from the person, two offences of attempt to obtain benefit by deception and two offences of steal motor vehicle.  
     
      
    13 His Honour Andrew ADCJ imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Indictment One:  
       
      Count One 
      : Imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to date from 15 June 2003 and expire 14 June 2004. 
       
      Count Two 
      : Imprisonment for five years to date from 15 June 2003 and expire 14 June 2008 with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 15 June 2003 and expire 14 June 2006. 
       
      Counts Three and Four 
      : On each count imprisonment for a fixed term of six months to date from 15 June 2003 and expire 14 December 2003.  
       
       
      Indictment Two 
      :  
       
      (Robbery in Company): Imprisonment for six years to date from 15 June 2004 and expire 14 June 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 15 June 2004 and expire 14 June 2008.  
       
      Aggravated stealing from the person (05.01.03): Imprisonment for six years to date from 15 June 2005 and expire on 14 June 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 15 June 2005 and expire on 14 June 2008. (Form One matters taken into account). 
       
      All other matters on Indictment Two: On each count, imprisonment for a fixed term of three years to date from 15 June 2005 and expire 14 June 2008.  
       
       
      The total effective sentence is eight years with a non-parole period of six years expiring on 14 June 2009. From all of these sentences, the applicant seeks leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals the sentences imposed.  
       
      
    14 It is least confusing to deal with the offences in the manner suggested by counsel for the applicant on appeal, namely: 
     
      
    a Steal motor vehicle between 1 and 5 November 2002 (s.154A Crimes Act);b Aggravated break and enter with intent to commit indictable offence, circumstance of aggravation being in company and the serious indictable offence being stealing, on 4 November 2002 (s.113(2), Crimes Act);c Malicious damage to a shop, 4 November 2002 (s.195, Crimes Act);d Malicious damage to an automatic teller machine, 4 November 2002 (s.195, Crimes Act); 
     
      
       
      All of the above are matters on which the applicant was convicted after a plea of not guilty. The following matters were the subject to a plea of guilty. 
       
      
    e Robbery in company on 25 October 2002 (s.97(1), Crimes Act);f Aggravated steal from a person on 5 January 2003, the circumstance of aggravation being the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm (s.95, Crimes Act);g Steal from the person on 5 January 2003 (s.94, Crimes Act);h Steal from the person on 7 January 2003 (s.94, Crimes Act);i Steal from the person on 31 March 2003 (s.94, Crimes Act). 
     
      
    15 In the first group of offences Offence (b) was an attempt, by ramming the wall of a bank with a car to steal an automatic teller machine. Offences (a), (c) and (d) were offences associated with that attempted stealing of an ATM which were the stealing of the motor vehicle used in the raid and the damage to the bank and ATM respectively.  
     
      
       
      In the early hours of Sunday, 3 November 2002, the applicant stole a Toyota Hino truck outside premises in Lenora. The vehicle had been locked and secured. At about 3.30 am on Monday, 4 November 2002 the applicant reversed the stolen truck into a shop front at Guildford, the front of which was a St George ATM. As a result of the impact, the majority of the building collapsed. The vehicle was located nearby. The vehicle had collided with a telephone pole which had snapped in half and landed on the truck. On the rear of the truck there was a large amount of bricks and two large welding cylinders. The ram raid was captured on surveillance footage.  
       
      
    16 The next offence, Offence (e), was the first of the offences to which DBN pleaded guilty and is described in a document, being the Facts on Sentence, to which recital the applicant agrees.  
     
      
    17 In April 2002 the victim purchased a second hand Yamaha motorbike for $6,300.00. In September 2002, the victim decided to sell his motor bike and placed an advertisement in the Trading Post. At about 5 pm on Thursday, 24 October 2002 the victim was at his home address in Erskine Park when he received a telephone call from a male identifying himself as “Brett” who, in fact, was the applicant. The applicant said he was interested in purchasing the motorbike. After speaking on the phone on a couple of occasions, arrangements were made for the applicant to come to the victim’s house to look at the motorbike. After some rearranging of times the applicant arrived at the victim’s home at about 7.50 pm on 24 October 2002. He arrived in a Holden Commodore and entered the premises with another man while a third man remained in the car. There was a discussion about the bike. The bike was started and there was a discussion concerning the fact that the victim had the bike chained up and always kept it so. They negotiated a sale price and arrangements were made for the applicant to return the next day. Before doing so the victim gave the applicant an exercise book containing the chassis numbers for the bike which he needed to read and for which purpose he borrowed the victim’s torch.  
     
      
    18 No contact was made at the arranged time on 25 October 2002 and at or about 11.00 am that day, the victim attempted to call the applicant with no success. At or about 2.00 pm on 25 October 2002, contact was made by the applicant who informed the victim that he was “keen and about 20 minutes away.” The victim returned home and by the time the applicant arrived, the victim was home with his wife and their five month old daughter. The applicant arrived with three others, one of whom remained in the van, that, by that time, they were driving. After about 5 minutes while the three men, including the applicant, were looking at the bike and talking about it, the victim’s wife entered the garage with the daughter, gave their daughter to the victim and left the house. The victim placed his daughter in a rocker in the garage, next to him. There was some discussion about the capacity to take the bike for a test drive and the fact that the paper work for the bike was not presently available.  
     
      
    19 The applicant and his companion from the previous evening returned to the van ostensibly to obtain money while the third man remained talking with the victim. While they were talking, the victim bent over to check on his daughter who remained, at all relevant times, in her rocker in the garage. While the applicant and the companion from the previous evening were still at the van, the victim looked up and saw the third person in company standing close to him with a wheel brace in his right hand. The wheel brace was not the property of the victim. The victim backed out of the garage and into the back yard. Two of the four persons followed him out. As he was doing so, the victim saw the applicant and one of the other persons in the garage, taking away the bike. He was told by one of the offenders to “get on your knees and face the back fence”. The victim said “no, it’s not happening.” One of the other offenders came at the victim again who shaped to punch him. The offender backed away towards the garage while another picked up a pitch fork from the victim’s garden and held it up to keep the victim away from him as he walked back into the garage with the other offender. The victim followed them back into the garage. The victim checked on his daughter then opened the garage door to see the white van, the applicant and the others were in, driving away.  
     
      
    20 Offence (f) was a bag snatching incident which occurred at the BP Service Station at Casula. The victim got out of her car and another vehicle, which happened to have been stolen, drove up beside her. The applicant got out of the vehicle and moved to the victim’s passenger door and opened it while the victim was on the opposite side of the car. The victim saw the offender take her purse from inside the car. The offender ran back to his car and the victim ran after him. The applicant got into the driver’s seat of the stolen vehicle and the victim grabbed hold of the applicant’s right hip and upper thigh in an attempt to prevent him from leaving with her bag. The applicant’s car moved away with the victim holding onto him. The victim fell to the ground and was dragged along on her knees for four metres at which point she let go. As a result of the incident the victim sustained bruising, swelling and abrasions to the left side of her back and rib cage, both knees and one hand. The victim’s purse contained $160 cash, a credit card and personal items.  
     
      
    21 Offence (g) occurred on 5 January 2003 at about 7.15 pm. The victim drove to a Caltex Service Station at West Hoxton. The victim parked her car in the car park and the applicant drove up beside her in the stolen vehicle described above. The victim was sitting in her car when the offender got out of the car, walked over to the victim’s car and opened the front passenger door. The applicant grabbed the victim’s hand bag from the centre console and pulled the strap from the victim’s grasp. The applicant got back into the stolen car and drove out of the service station. The victim’s hand bag contained $700 in cash, credit cards and personal papers.  
     
      
    22 Offence (h) occurred at 5.00 pm on 7 January 2003. The victim was at the Narellan Town Centre Car Park placing groceries in the rear of her vehicle. The applicant walked up to the victim and grabbed her hand bag off the shopping trolley. The applicant ran away with the hand bag before getting into the passenger seat of the same stolen vehicle used on the other two occasions. The victim’s hand bag contained a leather purse with $2,910 cash, credit cards, cheque books, a Nokia phone, a bracelet and three rings valued at $46,000. None of the items have been recovered.  
     
      
    23 Offence (i) occurred on 31 March 2003 at about 4.50 pm. The victim was in the car park at Westfield Shopping Centre Liverpool. The victim placed her groceries and handbag in the rear seat and was in the driver’s seat. The applicant approached the victim’s car, opened the rear door and took the victim’s hand bag. The applicant ran to a motor vehicle and drove from the scene. The victim’s hand bag contained $180 cash, a Nokia mobile phone and personal items.  
     
      
    24 As earlier stated, to these offences must be added those matters on a Form One which were sixteen offences and which were sought to be taken into account in relation to the sentencing of offence (f). The sixteen offences consisted of twelve further steal from person offences committed between 6 January and 30 March 2003, two offences of attempt to obtain benefit by deception and two offences of steal motor vehicle. The steal from person offences on the Form One were a series of bag snatches.  
     
      
    25 As earlier stated the applicant seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed and, if leave were granted, seeks that the appeal be allowed and a lesser sentence imposed by this Court. The applicant raises three grounds, the first two of which relate to the inappropriate use of purported aggravating factors arising under s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the third ground relates to the alleged failure by the sentencing judge to give effect to his finding of special circumstances in the aggregation of the sentences imposed for each of the groups of offences.  
     
      
       
      Grounds one and two: aggravating features pursuant to s.21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      . 
       
      
    26 His Honour, Andrew ADCJ took into account the Applicant’s criminal record of convictions as part of a passage which seems to have examined s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and used it as an aide memoire in dealing with the sentence imposed on offences (a) to (d). Likewise, and dealing with the same offences, his Honour treated the fact that the offence was committed in company as an aggravating factor in the determination of offences (a) to (d). Further, and in the same way, his Honour took into account the fact that the robbery was committed in company as an aggravating feature for the purpose of sentencing in relation to offence (e) and took into account as an aggravating feature the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm in relation to offence (f).  
     
      
    27 This Court has been required over the recent past to deal with the application by sentencing judges of one or more of the factors adumbrated in s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act without regard by them to the concluding words of that sub-section. The concluding words of sub-section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 require the Court “not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” Further, ss.21A(4) of the Act prohibits the Court from having regard to “any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.” To have regard to a factor as an aggravating factor in sentencing when it is an element of the offence is to double count the factor.  
     
      
    28 Further, the use by the sentencing judge of previous convictions is said to be “as an aggravating factor” pursuant to the terms of s.21A(2)(f) the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Prior convictions may be taken into account in the sentencing of an offender, but only in accordance with the principles established by the High Court of Australia in Veen [No 2] (1998) 164 CLR 465 and particularly at page 477. (See also R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 765 at [32] [37]). Where, as here, the sentencing judge relies upon the criminal history as “an aggravating factor” without any explanation, it may be taken that the criminal history is being used in an impermissible sense. Given the comments of his Honour, this too seems, on its face, to be an error in the sentencing principles.  
     
      
    29 It must be said, however, in dealing with errors of the kind referred to above, that the Court appreciates the lack of resources that are available to sentencing judges, often including the lack of transcript and the temptation to use s.21A as an aide memoire to ensure that the sentencing judge considers each of the factors required by that section. Often, it is obvious that, notwithstanding technical error in the manner in which s.21A factors have been said to be used, that error seems to have had little or no effect on the sentence imposed. I will return to this later.  
     
      
       
      Ground three: Special circumstances 
       
      
    30 The sentencing judge held that there were special circumstances in relation to each of the sentences making up the total effective sentence based on the applicant’s perceived prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    31 His Honour fixed a non-parole period for each of the sentences of 60%, 66% and 66% for offences (b), (e) and (f) of the head sentence imposed in each of the matters.  
     
      
    32 Almost invariably, the effect of a partial accumulation on sentencing will be to increase the ratio between non-parole period and the head sentence. It is for that reason that the partial accumulation of sentences will itself be a special circumstance to allow a Judge to reduce the last sentence for the purpose of ensuring that the overall effective non-parole period is, to the extent desired by the Judge, 75% of the period of the combined head sentences. (See R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252 at [3], [19] and [24]) 
     
      
    33 In circumstances where a sentencing judge deliberately fixes a non-parole period which is less than the statutory ratio described in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it will be assumed that that ratio is to be reflected in the overall sentence ratio, unless the judge expressly signifies otherwise. (See R v Swan, supra, R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215 at [10]–[13]) 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    34 The sentences imposed in this matter which are now the subject of appeal have been imposed for a number of different offences and are said to include consideration of a further sixteen criminal acts contained in a Form One submitted to the sentencing judge. As was sought to be earlier conveyed, some of those offences are particularly problematic and are at above mid-range in criminality of the kind of offence of which the applicant was convicted. For example, the robbery in company in which the victim (i.e. the person from whom the bike was stolen) was separated from his five month old daughter who was, during the episode, at the whim of the offenders. Even though there is nothing before the Court that would suggest that a threat was made to the daughter, it is obvious from the facts as recited that this was a major concern of the victim. Further, the maximum sentence for that offence was 20 years’ imprisonment, as was the maximum sentence for offence (f). In the circumstances of the number and type of offences for which the applicant was sentenced, a total effective sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of six years is not inappropriate or excessive. The Court must be satisfied that it would impose a less severe sentence on the whole of the evidence or, in the words of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court must form an opinion that “some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”. (R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704). If that opinion is not formed, the existence of error is insufficient of itself to justify interference. 
     
      
    35 The errors in the application of s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act seem to have had little or no effect on the sentence ultimately passed by his Honour. Further, the sentences imposed by his Honour, as earlier stated, even in the circumstances of the matters to which his Honour made reference, are lenient.  
     
      
    36 In the particular circumstances of the applicant and the offences for which he was being sentenced, a reduction in the effective sentence of six years non-parole period would bring the sentence to a level which, in my opinion, would be unjustly low, and I am not of the opinion that a different sentence than that which was ultimately imposed is warranted.  
     
      
    37 In the circumstances I propose the following orders: 
     
      
    a Leave to appeal against sentence be granted;b Appeal against sentence be dismissed.

    1 STUDDERT J:  I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Howie J and the orders that he proposes. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The respondent to this Crown appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act pleaded guilty before a magistrate to an offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being cocaine. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. It carries relevantly a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The respondent was committed to the District Court for sentence. 
     
      
    4 On 26 May 2005, because of some deficiency in the committal document, the respondent was arraigned on that charge before Judge Sorby (the Judge) and pleaded guilty. He also asked the Judge to take into account an offence of possessing a prohibited drug on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. On 20 June 2005 the Judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of the term of 2 years 6 months. The non-parole period is to expire on 8 September 2008. The Crown appealed against this sentence by notice dated 19 July 2005. 
     
      
    5 The facts can be adequately stated from the statement of facts tendered by the Crown and adopted by the Judge in his sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 6, 7 and 9 September 2004, Ngoc Hiep Dang spoke, by telephone, with a supplier and a buyer in relation to the supply of a prohibited drug. These calls were intercepted by police pursuant to telephone intercept warrants. After reviewing the calls, the police placed Dang under surveillance. 
         
         
        At about 1.20pm on 9 September 2004, police were in the vicinity of Park Avenue in Burwood conducting covert surveillance on Dang. At this time, Dang was sitting in his Honda Accord motor car, registration number AFW-08G. At about 1.35pm, after a short meeting with an unknown man, Dang started his car and then drove to a unit complex at Bayside Terrace in Cabarita. The police kept Dang under surveillance and followed him. 
         
         
        Shortly before 1.55pm, Dang arrived at Bayside Terrace. He got out of his car and began to walk towards the entrance to a block of units at 27-36/1 Bayside Terrace. He was carrying a red “Nike” brand shopping bag. As Dang walked towards the entrance, Detective Inspector Chapman of the South-East Asian Crime Squad approached Dang and introduced himself as a police officer. Dang was told that the shopping bag was believed to contain prohibited drugs. Dang agreed to let Detective Chapman look in the shopping bag. The shopping bag contained a cardboard box. The cardboard box was wrapped in a transparent plastic bag. A block of compressed powder was inside the cardboard box. The compressed powder was cocaine. The cocaine weighed 983 grams and had a purity of 82.5%. Dang was placed under arrest and Detective Chapman radioed for assistance. 
         
         
        A short time later, other investigating police arrived at Bayside Terrace. Dang was cautioned and was then searched by police. In Dang’s front left trouser pocket, police located a mobile phone. The phone was one of the phones that the police were monitoring pursuant to a telephone interception warrant. Dang’s car was also searched by police. In the “map recess” on the driver’s door, police located a piece of cellophane containing 1.67 grams of methylamphetamine. 
         
         
        Dang was then conveyed to the Burwood Police Station. At the police station, Dang declined to participate in an electronically recorded interview with the police. He was later charged in relation to this matter. 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant told both a probation officer and a psychologist that he was simply acting as a deliveryman. However, the Judge made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The police evidence of the telephone calls indicate(s) to me, that the prisoner’s role was more than that of a mere courier. He contacted both the supplier and the buyer. He was directly involved in the dissemination of drugs, and a large amount of high quality illegal drugs into the community, in my opinion, based upon the material before me. 
        
       
      
    7 The Judge noted that the amount of drug supplied was almost four times the prescribed commercial quantity. The Judge also noted that it was of very high purity, being 82.5 per cent pure. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The possession of such a quantity, with such a quality, for supply is objectively very serious and the community expects condign punishment to be meted out in such cases. 
        
       
      
    8 The respondent was aged 24 years at the time of the offence. He was born in Vietnam and he came to Australia with his family in 1989. He obtained the Higher School Certificate and completed a Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE. He gained employment as a computer technician but was dismissed in relation to a computer stolen from his employer. He was charged with receiving the computer and on 23 April 2003 placed on a bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by the Local Court. The period of the bond was two years and, therefore, was current at the time of the commission of the offence for which he was sentenced in the District Court. The Judge recognised that it was an aggravating factor of the offence that he was on conditional liberty at the time of its commission: see s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    9 The respondent told a psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentencing court, that losing his job was a devastating experience for him in light of his subsequent inability to secure further employment in the industry. He said that he became “increasingly depressed, demoralised and anxious”. At about this time the respondent’s partner became pregnant and he and his partner returned to live with his parents. This further added to his depression and humiliation. The psychologist stated that it was in the context of this history and “his attendant psychological vulnerability” that the respondent became involved in the offence for which he was before the court. 
     
      
    10 The applicant told the probation officer that he commenced using ecstasy at the age of 18 on a recreational basis. He commenced using cocaine about 6 months before the commission of the offence and was using up to two grammes a day at the time of his arrest. The psychologist was of the opinion that the use of the drug would have impacted upon his capacity to reason at the time. The respondent told a probation officer that he was offered money and drugs for his involvement in the offence but that he was not fully aware of the repercussions of his actions or the seriousness of his involvement. 
     
      
    11 At the time of the offending the respondent was no longer in a relationship with the mother of his child. At the sentencing proceedings evidence was given by his then current girlfriend as to the support that the respondent enjoyed from his family. She also stated that after his arrest the respondent was “wiser” and that he was “sorry for breaking the law and especially for putting his family in distress, especially his parents”. She gave evidence that work would be available for the respondent on his release. 
     
      
    12 The psychologist reported that the respondent appeared to be “more insightful to his problems and at examination expressed considerable remorse for his behaviour” which remorse the psychologist believed to be genuine. He thought that with appropriate support and treatment “the prognosis is very positive”. 
     
      
    13 The Judge stated that the variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term in the sentence he imposed “reflects the requirement that the prisoner undergo appropriate rehabilitation, which I find to be a special circumstance”. 
     
      
    14 The substantial basis of the Crown appeal is that the Judge failed to properly apply s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as it has been interpreted by this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and subsequent cases. In particular the Crown stressed that these decisions recognise that the standard non-parole period prescribed for a certain class of an offence has a significance as a reference point, bench mark or guide post to the appropriate sentence even though there may be reasons for the court to determine that some shorter sentence should be imposed: R v Way at [122]; R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]. 
     
      
    15 The standard non-parole period prescribed for an offence with which the respondent was to be sentenced is 10 years imprisonment. The non-parole period imposed upon the respondent was imprisonment for 4 years. The Crown submits that, in light of the objective seriousness of the particular offence committed by the respondent, such a disparity between the standard non-parole period and the non-parole period imposed would be itself indicative of error. But the Crown submits there was patent error to be found in the way that the judge sought to apply the principles enunciated in Way. 
     
      
    16 The Judge referred to the fact that a standard non-parole period of 10 years was prescribed for the offence under Division 1A of Part 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On the basis of the authorities of R v Way and R v Blair the standard non-parole period is not a mandatory figure for which a sentencing judge must not depart. How the Division is to be applied by the sentencing judge that (sic) was set out in R v Way as follows: 
         
          
           
          ‘In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: ""are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period'"" 
           
           
          That question will be answered by considering: 
           
           
          (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
           
           
          (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1).’  
           
          
         
        Having viewed all the circumstances of the offence referred to above and contained in the material before me, I have reached the conclusion that the offence, as serious as it is, falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind and therefore I do not intend to impose a standard non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    17 With respect to the Judge it is difficult to make sense of the last paragraph of that passage as it has been transcribed. If the Judge found that the offence was in the mid range of seriousness, it would not follow that he would not impose a standard non-parole period. Rather he should impose the standard non-parole period unless there was a reason to impose a lesser or longer sentence: see s 58B(2). Section 58B(4) requires the court to record its reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. In the present case one reason might have been that the respondent pleaded guilty. But that would not be the end of the matter because the standard non-parole period would still have some work to do as an indication of what the appropriate sentence should be even though the court had found a reason to depart from that standard non-parole period. This is the error relied upon by the Crown in the Judge’s approach to determining the respondent’s sentence. 
     
      
    18 Mr Game SC, who appeared for the respondent, had a different explanation for what the Judge intended to indicate in this paragraph. He submitted that it should be read on the basis that, although the Judge found that the offence was in the mid range of seriousness, he did not intend to impose the standard non-parole period because the respondent had pleaded guilty. Mr Game referred to portions of the transcript where the Crown conceded that the Judge could depart from the standard non-parole because the respondent had pleaded guilty. In making this submission, of course, Mr Game accepted that it was open to the Judge to find that the offence fell within the mid range of seriousness. To some extent that was a submission against his client’s interest because it makes the disparity between the standard non-parole period and the non-parole imposed even more stark. 
     
      
    19 However, Mr Game submitted that, if the Judge applied a reduction of 25 per cent from the standard non-parole period by reason of the plea and then reduced the sentence further by the subjective features of the respondent, a non-parole period of 4 years, while at the very bottom of the range, could not be said to be so inadequate as to justify the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    20 It is difficult to try to reconstruct the Judge’s actual reasoning from the sentencing remarks. I do not find Mr Game’s attempt to be satisfactory, particularly when it accepts a finding against the interest of the respondent. It seems to me more likely that what the Judge meant to say, or what he said that was erroneously transcribed, was that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the particular offence, it did not fall into the mid range of seriousness of an offence of that kind and, therefore, he did not intend to impose the standard non-parole period. The apparent reason for departing from the standard non-parole period was that the offence fell outside the mid range of seriousness: Way at [67]. This is the way I believe the remarks should be interpreted for the purpose of this appeal. 
     
      
    21 However, the Judge did not indicate why it was that he came to that view of the seriousness of the offence. In R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175 there was a Crown appeal against a sentence in respect of an offence for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed of 5 years. In departing from the standard non-parole period, the sentencing judge gave the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The standard non-parole sentence is five years. I consider in the circumstances of this case and taking into account the submissions of counsel, that it is appropriate that the sentence to be imposed be less than the standard non-parole term. That is the view of the Court in relation to each of the counts."" 
        
       
       
      Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, held: 
       
        
         
        49 I do not consider that this was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of s 54B(4) A mere statement of the conclusion, accompanied by a confirmation that the submissions of counsel, and the circumstances of the case, have been taken into account, does not constitute an identification of the reasons which are expected in a case which falls within the umbrella of the Division. As is also the case in relation to s 21A of the Act, more is expected than mere lip service to the legislation. What is required is a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order: see R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109. 
         
         
        50 The present case, it may be accepted, was one involving pleas of guilty, so that the role of the standard non-parole period was as a reference or check point: R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168. That circumstance does not however lessen the obligation to give adequate reasons in relation to this aspect of sentencing. 
         
         
        51 The absence of sufficient reasons does not necessarily guarantee intervention by this Court. Whether it should do so, in this case, depends upon the remaining grounds. 
        
       
      
    22 Whether a sentence falls within the mid-range of seriousness of an offence of a particular kind is a matter of judgment on which minds might reasonably differ. To succeed on an appeal, the appellant or the Crown would have to show that it was not open for the sentencing judge to make the finding that he or she did in the particular case. Where, as here, the sentencing judge does not indicate the factors taken into account in making the determination of where the offence stands in relation to an offence falling within the mid range of seriousness this Court might be more willing to find error if it disagrees with the finding made by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    23 The manner in which a court is to determine whether an offence falls within the mid range of seriousness and the relevant factors to be taken into account were extensively discussed and analysed in Way. They were summarised by Simpson J in AJP at [13]. Included in that summary are the following points (the paragraph numbers cited refer to relevant portions of the judgment in Way): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74] - [77]); 
         
         
        (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the mens rea of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85] - [86])” 
        
       
      
    24 Clearly there will be a range of factors that are relevant to a determination of whether an offence of supplying a prohibited drug falls within the mid-range of seriousness. The amount and purity of the drug will be significant matters but they are not decisive: Way at [159]. The number of occasions on which the drug was supplied, the motivation for the supply, the planning involved and the role of the offender in the supply are obviously relevant matters. In R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 at [35], [37-38] Wood CJ at CL stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        35 As was decided in Regina v Way the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence before the Court is not confined to a consideration of the circumstances which are specifically listed in s 21A(2) and (3). The motive of an offender, or any condition which affects the offender's state of mind which impinges upon the elements comprised within the mens rea is of relevance, although less so in the case of any condition which is self induced through abuse of alcohol or drugs.  
         
         
        37 I am satisfied, applying the approach that was found to be appropriate in Regina v Way that error was shown. The offence involved in this case was a serious offence, having regard to the weight and the purity of the drugs involved, and also to the fact that the respondent knowingly, and with his eyes open, lent his aid to those who directed the supply network, in order to feed his habit, and in order to clear a debt.  
         
         
        38 Clearly the case fell well below the middle range of seriousness, since the respondent was not a principal, and was not shown to have been engaged in the work of a courier on more than one occasion. There is also the fact that his supplier had taken advantage of him.  
        
       
      
    25 Shi was a case where the respondent had been found in possession of 992.2 g of methylamphetamine of an 84.5 per cent purity. The sentencing judge found that he was a runner or courier at the very bottom of the supply hierarchy. He was vulnerable because of his age, background and drug addiction. His vulnerability had been preyed upon by older men in the organisation but he had not been a mere dupe. Although the supply was planned, the respondent was not part of the actual planning or organisation and he was not profiting except to feed his addiction. 
     
      
    26 The Court in Shi upheld a Crown appeal in respect of a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of two years and substituted a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. The Court gave as reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) notwithstanding the substantial quantity and level of purity of the drug involved, the fact that it was committed without regard to public safety, and the additional fact that it was part of an organised criminal activity, the respondent's role was that of a runner or courier, who became involved in a circumstance where he had been preyed upon by older men, and at a time when he had been vulnerable (by reason of his age and background), with the consequence that the offence fell below the mid level of seriousness.  
         
         
        (b) he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity; 
         
         
        (c) he had no prior convictions and was of prior good character; 
         
         
        (d) he had good prospects of rehabilitation; 
         
         
        (e) he had shown genuine remorse; 
         
         
        (f) he had not fully analysed his position; and  
         
         
        (g) he was relatively young and would be experiencing a first term of imprisonment.  
        
       
      
    27 At least two of the errors identified by the Court in Shi also appear to me to have occurred in the sentencing of the respondent. Firstly the Judge appears to have thought, contrary to Way, that the standard non-parole period applied regardless of whether the offender was convicted after a plea of guilty or after trial. Secondly the Judge appears to have thought that it was unnecessary to have any further regard to the standard non-parole once he had determined that the offence fell outside the mid range of seriousness. 
     
      
    28 The Crown has argued its case on the basis that his Honour assessed the objective criminality of the offence as being within the mid range of seriousness. It has contended that, given the amount and purity of the drug and the fact that he was more than a courier, the Judge should have considered that the offence was above the mid range of seriousness. The first submission is in my view based on a misinterpretation of a transcription error of what the Judge said or meant to say. The second submission in my view is unsupportable and places too much weight on the amount and purity of the drug. It is inconsistent with the finding in Shi. 
     
      
    29 The Crown placed considerable emphasis in its submissions on the fact that the drug in the present case was cocaine whereas the drug in Shi was amphetamine and, therefore, the present was a more serious offence by reason of the nature of the drug being supplied. However, I note that there was no suggestion in Shi that one of the matters that took the offence below the mid range of seriousness was that the drug supplied was amphetamine. This Court no longer approaches the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence: R v Nai Poon (2003) 56 NSWLR 284; R v Neale (2004) 148 A Crim R 493. The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act does not distinguish in any way between cocaine and methylamphetamine: the maximum penalty for offences involving the two drugs is the same, as are the prescribed quantities. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion it was open for the Judge to find, as I believe he did, that the offence was one that fell below the mid range of seriousness for the offence of supply notwithstanding the amount and purity of the drug. Although the respondent was more than a courier and was involved to some degree in the actual planning of the offence, there was only a single instance of supply. Further, the applicant was motivated by his addiction to cocaine even though he had become addicted to the drug as a matter of choice. 
     
      
    31 In any event the Judge was entitled to depart from the standard non-parole period and impose a lesser sentence by reason of the fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty. The Judge was also entitled to take into account in determining the non-parole period that the respondent had only one matter on his criminal record, had shown remorse and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. It was also his first time in prison. However, the offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion a non-parole period of 4 years as against the standard non-parole period of 10 years is manifestly inadequate. Even though it was open to the Judge to find that the offence was not within the mid range of seriousness, it was not very far below that range given the seriousness of the applicant’s conduct and the amount and purity of the drug involved. The applicant could not have been mistaken about the quantity or the quality of the drugs as he had organised the sale as a middleman between the supplier and the purchaser: cf Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 609. The applicant was going to receive both money and drugs as a result of the sale. Even though his judgment might have been clouded by his use of cocaine, that can have little mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence because it was self-induced by his abuse of drugs. 
     
      
    33 I believe that the Judge could not have used the standard non-parole period as a guide or indicator to the sentence to be imposed and achieved the result that he did, even after taking into account the discount for the plea of guilty. In any event as against a maximum penalty of 20 years, a term of imprisonment totalling 6½ years is also manifestly inadequate. The Judge has either given insufficient weight to the seriousness of the offence or too much weight to the subjective factors favouring the respondent. In my view the least sentence the Judge could have imposed was a sentence totalling 9 years and the least non-parole period was 5½ years. 
     
      
    34 But this is a Crown appeal and, therefore, this Court has a discretion whether to intervene notwithstanding that error has been shown. One of the relevant matters to be taken into account is the notion of double jeopardy inherent in a Crown appeal. Generally speaking, if the Court decides it should intervene, it will impose a sentence at the lowest end of range available to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    35 However, in the present case the Court has been made aware that, if the respondent were re-sentenced to a term that included a non-parole period of more than 5 years, his progress through classification would be retarded. He is currently classified as C1. In light of the fact that the respondent is a relatively young man who is apparently progressing well in custody, in my opinion the Court should not impose the sentence that ought to have been imposed by the sentencing judge but should reduce it to assist the respondent maintain his present classification. 
     
      
    36 The reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period are: 
     
      
       
        
       
      (i) notwithstanding the amount and purity of the drug and that he was involved in planned criminal activity, the respondent was not a principal and had only been involved in a single supply as a result of his addiction to cocaine and, therefore, the offence fell below the mid range of seriousness; 
       
        
       
      (ii) the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time; 
       
        
       
      (iii) the respondent pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity; 
       
        
       
      (iv) the respondent was remorseful; 
       
        
       
      (v) the respondent does not have any significant record of other offences; 
       
        
       
      (vi) the respondent has good prospects of rehabilitation; 
       
        
       
      (vii) the respondent is serving his first sentence in custody; 
       
        
       
      (viii) the respondent’s current prison classification. 
       
      
    37 I propose that the appeal be allowed, the sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed and the respondent sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years to date from 9 September 2004 and to expire on 8 September 2009. There is to be a balance of the term of 4 years to expire on 8 September 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: The Court is in a position to give judgment. I will ask Justice McClellan to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent pleaded guilty to one charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon BH (also known as CH) contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. He also asked that a charge of neglecting to provide adequate and proper medical aid to BH contrary to s 228 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 be taken into account on sentencing. Both matters arose from an incident that occurred on 20 December 2003. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for the charge pursuant to the Crimes Act is seven years imprisonment. The maximum penalty in relation to the failure to provide adequate and proper medical aid is a fine of $22,000. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of one year, the sentence to be served by periodic detention. The charges arose from an incident which occurred on 20 December 2003. At that date the victim was approximately ten weeks old, having been born to the respondent’s wife’s sister. Three days after his birth the victim had been removed by the Department of Community Services from his mother who apparently suffered a psychiatric illness. The victim was placed in the foster care of the respondent and his wife. The respondent and his wife also had their own daughter, Angela, who was fourteen months old at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    5 On the relevant day the respondent was caring for both young children by himself at home while his wife was at work. In his records of interview conducted on 23 December 2003 the respondent told police he fed the victim in the afternoon and put him down to sleep. He was playing with Angela in another room when the victim awoke. The respondent went into the victim’s bedroom and changed his nappy. Angela began to cry and demanded attention while he did this. After changing the victim’s nappy the respondent lifted him into his arms. He then went to Angela to calm her down. While he was doing this, the victim fell about 1.5 metres from the respondent’s arms onto the carpeted floor of the bedroom. The respondent reached down, while still holding Angela, and picked up the victim by his arms. 
     
      
    6 The victim cried while on the floor. However, the respondent said that, when he picked up the victim, he was unresponsive. The respondent described the victim’s head as “bobbing” and said that one of the victim’s eyes was open and the other closed. The respondent put Angela down. He then clicked his fingers near the victim’s face and called the victim’s name. The victim did not respond and his arm was floppy. The respondent said that the victim was “I think, I dunno he was unconscious but I think he fall into a state of coma.” The respondent said that he began to shake the victim and then, with the palm of his hand, the respondent first tapped and then hit the victim over the back of his head. The respondent said he did not know how much force he applied in doing this although it is apparent, and he told the police, that he shook the victim “fairly hard because I didn’t want to lose him because he looked different.” 
     
      
    7 The respondent then wrapped the victim in a baby blanket and called the family’s general practitioner. He was told that the doctor was unavailable for a house call. The respondent felt unable to travel to the doctor’s surgery because (apparently) he did not have a car and he had the care of his fourteen month old daughter. The respondent was also expecting that his wife would soon return home from work. The respondent gave the victim a bottle of milk and he appeared to settle. 
     
      
    8 When the respondent’s wife returned home at about 6 pm she asked the respondent how the children were. The respondent told her they were fine. He told the police that he did not tell his wife about the incident with the victim because “it wasn’t that I didn’t want to tell her, actually I was scared of my wife, you know, because she will start to tell me, you know, what could happen, the consequence that it could happen is they know that the baby have an accident.” The respondent’s wife, however, checked the victim and told the respondent that there was a mark on him and that she noticed something strange about his face. The respondent told his wife that he had not seen the mark. He later told the police that he did not know whether he had caused the mark when he had picked up the victim from the floor. 
     
      
    9 The victim cried a lot during the night. Further attempts were made to feed him and he was given some Panadol. At about 5 am the respondent’s wife insisted on taking the victim to the hospital. The respondent still had not, by this stage, told his wife of the incident the previous afternoon.  
     
      
    10 The victim was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with fitting and a decreased level of consciousness. Because his fits were difficult to control, he was transferred to the Sydney Children’s Hospital at Randwick. The victim remained in hospital for eighteen days. 
     
      
    11 Medical investigations have revealed that the victim suffered: 
     
      
    · Subdural haematoma in the posterior fossa, on the tentorium and in the left middle cranial fossa;· Hypoxic ischaemic injury to both cerebral hemispheres, involving the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes bilaterally; and· A large pre-retinal haemorrhage covering the macula, many small pre-retinal haemorrhages and many (almost confluent) intra-retinal haemorrhages extending as far as could be seen into the retinal periphery. 
     
      
    12 As a consequence of his injuries the victim has suffered permanent brain damage and sight loss. 
     
      
    13 At the sentencing hearing evidence was called from three doctors, Dr Moran, Dr Donald and Dr Hilton, concerning the likely cause of the injuries sustained by the victim and the likely effect of the victim’s initial fall to the floor. 
     
      
    14 In summary, the oral evidence of the Crown expert, Dr Moran, was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think the only question that arises [is] about the fall [-] everybody agrees that the fall did not produce the injuries. I guess the only point is did the fall produce some level of unconsciousness or decreased level of consciousness which was then exacerbated by the fact that the carer of the child inflicted further injuries in whatever capacity … “ 
        
       
      
    15 The first of the defence experts, Dr Donald, said that the victim’s fall to the floor could have caused either unconsciousness or an alteration in consciousness. He noted that a comprehensive examination was needed to determine the state of consciousness because “[you] can’t discern the difference by looking” and he agreed that it would be “doubly difficult” for an untrained person to discern the difference in a ten week old child. In cross-examination, Dr Donald said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I mean there certainly did seem to be some evidence of alteration in [the victim’s] responsiveness which would fit with fluctuating conscious state.” 
        
       
      
    16 Dr Donald was of the opinion that the fact that the victim cried when he was picked up off the floor was more consistent with him having suffered an altered state of consciousness than unconsciousness. Dr Donald agreed that the subdural haematoma and retinal haemorrhages were caused by the respondent shaking the victim but said that the hypoxia (the ischaemic injury to both cerebral hemispheres) could have resulted from the victim’s subsequent fitting. 
     
      
    17 The second of the two defence experts, Dr Hilton, said that the victim was likely to have suffered a transient alteration in consciousness in the fall. In cross-examination Dr Hilton said it was possible that some of the injuries suffered by the victim were sustained in the fall, but said he “would accept that that brain damage in its totality was not caused by the fall.” He further said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think there are two aspects to this with respect your Honour. There’s the shaking and there’s the impacts. I cannot differentiate between what might have happened from the shaking or what might have happened from the impacts. What I have said is that this activity is a, inappropriate and b, is likely to have at least aggravated the chemical or physiological process which was already instituted by the initial impact on the floor.” 
        
       
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    18 The sentencing judge made the following findings of fact. 
     
      
       
      1. As the consequence of the assault on him, the victim suffered serious brain damage that has left him with “significant and substantial difficulties”; 
       
      2. The respondent is genuinely remorseful for his mistreatment of the victim, as evidenced by his admission when interviewed by the police and his guilty plea; 
       
      3. The admissions made by the respondent to the police were truthful and accurate; 
       
      4. The respondent’s guilty plea had “real utilitarian value” because it saved the victim’s family members from giving evidence and it showed the respondent’s remorse; 
       
      5. The victim slipped from the respondent’s arms and landed face down on the carpeted floor. The distance of the victim’s fall was likely to have been 1.2 metres rather than 1.5 metres. 
       
      6. The victim was likely to have been concussed by the fall, and appeared “different” to the respondent; 
       
      7. The bruises on the victim’s left forearm were caused by the respondent when he lifted the victim off the floor. The bruises on the victim’s left thumb and right hand were unrelated to the respondent’s mistreatment of the victim; 
       
      8. The initial fall was unlikely to have caused any of the victim’s injuries; 
       
      9. The respondent shook the victim “sufficiently often and sufficiently hard” to have caused his injuries; 
       
      10. The respondent’s slaps to the victim’s head probably compounded the victim’s injuries; 
       
      11. The victim’s injuries have left him with multiple severe permanent disabilities; 
       
      12. The respondent’s actions were serious. He knew that a baby should not be shaken or slapped about the head; and 
       
      13. The respondent’s actions were not premeditated or planned. The respondent “did not set out to deliberately or intentionally injure” the victim. Rather, the respondent panicked and acted unthinkingly and recklessly toward the victim. 
       
       
      The sentence 
       
      
    19 His Honour sentenced the respondent to two years imprisonment. He found special circumstances and provided a non-parole period of one year. His Honour ordered that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 The Crown appeals against the sentence and says that it was manifestly inadequate. In particular, it is said that his Honour erred by: 
     
      
    · Giving insufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offence and wrongly omitting to give consideration to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(g);· Giving irrelevant consideration to the availability of Local Court jurisdiction; and· Incorrectly formulating the sentence as his Honour was required to do pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 44. 
     
      
       
      Principles governing Crown appeals 
       
      
    21 This Court has had occasion in many cases to confirm the principles which must be applied when the Crown brings an appeal against sentence. They were summarised by Justice Wood in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
         
         
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 449, applies to crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen  
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait  
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388;  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere;  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “ 
        for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
        ”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass  
        (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis  
        (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 110. 
         
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder & Johnston  
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        at para 62.” 
        
       
      
    22 Wood CJ at CL referred to R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 where Spigelman CJ said at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that the present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.”[19] 
        
       
      
    23 In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 Gaudron and Gummow JJ said at [329]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In the circumstances of the present case, the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been “upon the facts …. unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.” Was the sentence ‘manifestly wrong’?” (footnotes omitted) 
        
       
       
      Insufficient weight given to injuries; omissions of aggravating features under the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 s 21A(2)(g) 
       
      
    24 The Crown emphasised that the victim has suffered extremely serious and permanent injuries as a result of being shaken by the respondent. It is submitted that the present case is similar to R v Clark, unreported, NSWCCA, 27 March 1995 in which the Court allowed a Crown appeal against a minimum term of six months and an additional term of eighteen months and re-sentenced the respondent to a minimum term of twelve months with an additional term of eighteen months. In that case Levine J said that the injuries “were extremely serious and to a great extent permanent.” His Honour described the six month minimum term imposed by the learned sentencing judge as falling ”within that class of sentence brought to this Court for review by the Crown, which can be characterised as in fact manifesting by its very terms an error having occurred in some way on the part of the sentencing judge.” His Honour said that the six month minimum term “does so very much offend against all sensible community attitudes in a relationship of trust to children, [and] is manifestly inadequate.” 
     
      
    25 The Crown points out that the injuries suffered by the victim exceed those which were found to have existed in R v Remilton [2001] NSWCCA 546, R v Rainbow unreported, NSWCCA, 20 December 1996 and R v Dunn unreported, NSWCCA, 6 November 1995. In Remilton the victim was the offender’s eight week old daughter who suffered facial bruising and skull fractures when she was struck very hard across the head by the offender who, out of frustration, had attempted to stop the child crying and screaming. In Rainbow the offender, became annoyed at a child’s crying and applied a hot steam iron to the victim’s body, causing the child to suffer burns of first and second degree severity to the abdomen which produced permanent scarring. The offender also struck the child some blows to the head. In Dunn the victim was being thrown into the air, at increasing heights, when her father failed to catch her causing serious injuries. 
     
      
    26 It is submitted that in failing to give sufficient weight to the nature of injuries in the present case, the sentencing judge specifically erred by failing to find that the offences were aggravated under subpara (g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 21A(2), “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.” 
     
      
    27 The Crown pointed out that in the present case because the injuries were permanent this case should have been viewed as a somewhat more serious case than Remilton. Instead the sentencing judge found that the present case was “somewhat less serious”. 
     
      
    28 His Honour refers to Remilton but the reference is not confined to the nature of the injuries. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although this case is similar to, but somewhat less serious than,  
        R v Remilton  
        [2001] NSWCCA 546, I consider that I should not suspend execution of the sentence. However, taking everything into account, I have decided that the non-parole period of the sentence should be served by periodic detention.” 
        
       
      
    29 To my mind, his Honour’s observations that the present case was “somewhat less serious” were directed, not so much to the injuries which occurred but rather the manner in which they were inflicted. As the cases to which I have referred indicate, where criminal charges are brought for injuries to a small child the offender usually inflicts injury out of a sense of anger or frustration which causes a loss of control. This will often be a misguided attempt to punish the child in an attempt to calm it. 
     
      
    30 In this respect the present case is most unusual. The sentencing judge found that the initial fall was an accident following which the respondent, apparently out of concern to revive the child, inflicted further injury. Although the stupidity of the respondent’s actions cannot be under estimated, his Honour did not find that he intended to inflict harm upon the child. Quite the contrary. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not doubt the seriousness of the offender’s actions towards BH. I do not doubt that the offender knew that a baby should not be shaken or slapped about the head. However, I doubt that the offender’s actions were premeditated or planned. I believe that he did not set out to deliberately or intentionally injure BH, rather I believe that he panicked in the situation in which he found himself and then acted unthinkingly and recklessly towards BH.” 
        
       
      
    31 I am not satisfied that his Honour has erred in the conclusion he reached in relation to this aspect of the matter. 
     
      
       
      Irrelevant consideration of Local Court jurisdiction 
       
      
    32 His Honour made reference to the concurrent jurisdiction of the Local Court and said “I consider that the offender is entitled to have this factor taken into account in his favour, resulting in a discount, albeit small, in penalty.” 
     
      
    33 The Crown submits that, given the seriousness of this case, his Honour was in error by awarding any reduction in penalty because the Local Court would have had jurisdiction to sentence the respondent see R v Royal [2003] NSWCCA 275 at [38]. It is submitted that it could never have been the situation that it was appropriate to deal with this matter in the Local Court. The respondent accepts that the sentencing judge may have erred in this respect. It is acknowledged that his Honour said that a small discount should be applied for this factor although the respondent emphasised that no indication was given of what that discount would have been.  
     
      
    34 To my mind the critical issue in this case is not the term of the sentence that was imposed but rather the fact that his Honour provided for the sentence to be served by periodic detention. The error which his Honour may have made is not reflected in his decision as to the manner in which the sentence is to be served. 
     
      
       
      Section 44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 
       
      
    35 When determining the appropriate sentence his Honour identified and answered a number of questions. The first question he identified was whether a term of imprisonment should be imposed. His Honour was satisfied that a prison term was appropriate.  
     
      
    36 The second question was the term of the sentence. His Honour indicated that he had determined that “the sentence should be imprisonment for two years six months, which period I reduce by 20%, that is by six months to two years.” 
     
      
    37 His Honour then asked the question whether there were special circumstances which warranted departure from the otherwise statutory apportionment of the period of the sentence into a non-parole period and a parole period. His Honour indicated that, having regard to the respondent’s unblemished character, his remorse, the likelihood that he will not re-offend and the excellent prospects of his rehabilitation “I have determined to apportion the period of the sentence into a non-parole period of one year and a parole period of one year.” This process of analysis was reflected when his Honour finally came to impose the sentence. He said, when carrying out that task having addressed the respondent: 
     
      
       
        
        “I sentence you to imprisonment for two years. I fix a non-parole period of one year and a parole period of one year. I order that the non-parole period of the sentence be served by periodic detention. I order that you report to the Metro Periodic Detention Centre, Parramatta Correctional Centre, at 8.30 am on Saturday 20 August 2005 to commence serving the sentence. In sentencing you for this offence, I have taken into account the additional offence itemised on the annexure to the Form 1  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        document.” 
        
       
      
    38 In proceeding in this way his Honour has erred. Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required his Honour to first fix the non-parole period and then determine that whether the parole period should exceed the statutory proportion. It is submitted by the Crown that this error contributed to the fixing of a manifestly inadequate non-parole and overall term. 
     
      
    39 I do not accept this submission. Although as I have indicated his Honour incorrectly formulated the sentence I am satisfied that this was a technical error with “little or no practical significance” see R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [39]. This is particularly the case when, as I have already indicated, the critical question in this matter is the manner in which the sentence was to be served. However, error having occurred, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the respondent. 
     
      
       
      Manifest inadequacy 
       
      
    40 Apart from the specific matters to which I have referred the Crown submitted that, having regard to the length of the sentence and non-parole period and the manner in which the sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention, the sentence is manifestly inadequate. It is submitted that the sentence fails to pay sufficient regard to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    41 The Crown submitted that the respondent’s actions in slapping the back of the child’s head and shaking him thereby causing very severe injuries and leaving him permanently and profoundly impaired, conduct which the respondent knew was wrong, was conduct so clearly offensive to the standards expected of persons entrusted with the care of very young children, that it can only be described as gravely serious. 
     
      
    42 Moreover, aware that the child was in distress and in need of medical intervention, after allegedly making an unsuccessful attempt to telephone a doctor, he chose not to inform his wife of what had occurred out of fear of consequences to himself, in disregard of the welfare of the child. The respondent chose not to disclose what had occurred, notwithstanding the development of symptoms that caused his wife concern, until the stage was reached early the following morning when she insisted that the baby be taken to the hospital. 
     
      
    43 In these circumstances it is suggested that his Honour has underestimated the gravity of the offence and made too great an allowance for the respondent’s subjective features. It is pointed out that this Court has recognised that periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and that a term of periodic detention cannot be mathematically equated with a period of full time custody. The punitive element of periodic detention is reduced by administrative arrangements allowing prisoners to perform part of their sentences by way of community service: R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim R 441; R v Potter (1994) 72 A Crim R 108; R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67. 
     
      
    44 Finally, it is submitted that there is a strong need for general deterrence in cases of physical violence against infants (see R v Pitcher (unreported, NSWCCA, 19 February 1996)). The offence was aggravated by reason of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 subpara (g): “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”, (k) “the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”, and (l) “the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young.” 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    45 The case is an extreme tragedy. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge, who has very considerable experience in the sentencing of offenders, carried out a detailed analysis of all of the evidence. His Honour was careful to identify the objective seriousness of the offence and the nature of the serious and permanent injuries which the victim has suffered. His Honour found that the respondent was a committed and caring foster father who did not deliberately shake or hit the victim with the intention of harming him but, rather, did so recklessly and in panic after the victim had suffered injury.  
     
      
    46 None of the cases to which the Crown has referred, all of which I am aware, involve circumstances similar to the present. In many of the cases which have been previously considered the respondent has acted in anger or frustration and with an apparent intention to inflict pain in order to either vent frustration or quieten the infant. In the present case the respondent acted out of panic in an attempt to revive the victim who, his Honour found, had accidentally fallen.  
     
      
    47 The respondent’s guilty plea was entered and accepted by the Crown on the basis that he committed a dangerous act and was reckless as to the possibility of injury to the victim. 
     
      
    48 The respondent’s actions were stupid and appropriate punishment required that the seriousness of the offence be marked with a term of imprisonment. The term which his Honour imposed was in my opinion within the appropriate sentencing range. However, the only question is whether or not his Honour erred by providing that the sentence should be served by periodic detention. As this Court has recognised periodic detention is not the same as full time custody and contains an element of leniency.  
     
      
    49 If I had been called upon to sentence the respondent I would have been inclined to provide that the sentence be served by a term of full time custody. However, having regard to the principles which apply to a Crown appeal, it is important to have in mind the very considerable impact upon the respondent if the sentence which he has already commenced serving by periodic detention was now to be converted in whole or in part to a period of full time custody. The evidence indicates that the respondent has complied with the terms of his prison sentence and is attempting to rebuild his life. Although I have carefully considered the Crown submissions I have come to the conclusion that to now provide for the respondent to serve a term of full time imprisonment would not be appropriate.  
     
      
    50 Accordingly, having regard only to the difficulties in relation to s 44, the appeal should be upheld to the extent necessary to correct the relevant error. 
     
      
    51 The orders I propose are that the appeal be allowed and the sentence quashed. In my opinion the respondent should be sentenced to a non-parole period of one year with an additional term of a further year. I order that the non-parole period portion of the sentence be served by periodic detention. I order the respondent to continue reporting to the Metropolitan Periodic Detention Centre, Parramatta Correctional Centre, to complete the balance of the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    52 In sentencing for this offence I have taken into account the additional offence items on the annexure to the Form 1 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act document.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SANTOW JA:  
     
      
      INTRODUCTION  
       
      The central issue in this case is whether:  
      (a) the actual cause of the plaintiff’s loss was not established with certainty, as between several alternative causes, so leading to consequential uncertainty as to the steps that might have been taken by the defendant manufacturer of a defective marine engine water-lift muffler to have averted that loss, and  
      (b) whether the degree of uncertainty that should have been found (as to the precise explanation for the defect) precluded recovery on the part of the boat owners for their loss in negligence or under consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (“TPA”).  
      
    2 Here, in a claim brought by two marine boat owners against the manufacturer for the failure of a marine water-lift muffler, which led to the sinking of their boat, the trial judge Sorby DCJ denied recovery essentially on the ground in (a) above. In one sense that was a curious result. It was clear that the defendant manufacturer’s muffler was defective in letting in water, so causing the plaintiffs’ boat to sink, and there was no basis for rendering the muffler’s installer liable.  
     
      
    3 The trial judge however concluded that the plaintiff boat-owners, upon whom rested the onus of proof, must lose as they had failed to provide “convincing evidence as to the actual defect in the design and manufacturing process and what could and should have been done to correct it” [emphasis added]. He had earlier concluded “the evidence discloses that no expert or the manufacturer can give a clear and unequivocal reason for the muffler’s failure” [emphasis added].  
     
      
    4 The plaintiffs at trial and now claimants, Mr David Thomas and Mr John Watt, seek leave to appeal and if granted a concurrent hearing. They seek to challenge the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no breach of duty by the manufacturer. They specifically take issue with his formulating the evidentiary onus in terms of “convincing evidence” or the necessity for “a clear and unequivocal reason for the muffler’s failure”.  
     
      
    5 The particular issues on appeal are:  
     
      
      (a) whether there was a breach of duty of care by the manufacturer Foreshore Marine Exhaust Systems Pty Limited (“FM”), the first opponent,  
      (b) whether the muffler was not of merchantable quality and not fit for its purpose under, respectively, s74D and s74B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (“TPA”),  
      (c) the interpretation and use of the expert evidence by the trial judge, and  
      (d) whether there was indeed no clear unequivocal evidence as to the actual cause of the failure of the muffler.  
      
    6 FM’s counsel accepted that, read literally, the trial judge’s reference to the necessity for “convincing evidence” being required to give “a clear and unequivocal reason for the muffler’s failure” overstated the onus upon the claimants as plaintiffs. They were required to do no more than prove their case, including causation, on the balance of probabilities. The claimants’ position was that the muffler’s failure was a thing which spoke for itself. Moreover, the precise reason why it failed was a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer and there was no explanation at trial consistent with the absence of negligence on its part.  
     
      
    7 FM accepted that this Court in granting leave to appeal would have to consider afresh the relevant evidence and inferences drawn therefrom according to the proper standard of proof on the balance of probabilities. FM’s position on appeal was that the claimants had nonetheless not met that standard; in particular that the claimants’ case never did “more than give rise to conflicting inferences of equal degree of probability so that the choice between them is a mere matter of conjecture”; per Dixon CJ in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 304. Accordingly they must lose.  
     
      
    8 The claimants for their part contended that this was a case where most of the facts could “hardly be within the knowledge of the plaintiff”. Accordingly, that while “a plaintiff is not relieved of the necessity of offering some evidence of negligence by the fact that the material circumstances are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant all that it means is that slight evidence might be enough and unless explained away by the defendant that the evidence should be weighed according to the power of the party to produce it …” per Dixon CJ in Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks [1957] 97 CLR 367 at 371. The claimants contended they had provided or elicited that evidence and that it established the manufacturer’s negligence on the balance of probabilities, indeed comfortably so.  
     
      
    9 In particular, the claimants contend that the preferred explanation for the muffler’s failure, inadequacy in the mode of its adhesion, was sufficiently established by the expert and other evidence, as against what became FM’s competing explanation, failure in the waterproofing of the gel coat around the muffler. In any event, the claimants contend that either of the possible explanations necessarily implied negligence on the part of FM as manufacturer. Insofar as any other conceivable explanation not implying negligence by the manufacturer was concerned such as the dropping of a spanner on the muffler, the claimants’ case was that there was no evidence for it. The latter explanation was in any event so improbable as not to displace the more probable explanation (inadequate adhesion) which necessarily implied negligence on the part of FM. Compare Dixon J in Davis v Bunn (1936) 56 CLR 246 at 260:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that such a thing is consistent with more than one cause not implying negligence. For example, the driver might have fainted, or the steering gear have failed through no fault of the defendant. But such unavoidable events are sufficiently unusual to raise a probability that the erratic course of the vehicle is to be accounted for by some failure in due care, whether in its management on the roadway or in the maintenance of its mechanical efficiency. In the absence of all explanation the probability would be high enough to justify an inference in the plaintiff’s favour. The legal burden of proof would not be thrown over to the defendant’s side. No more than a presumption of fact would arise and its strength would be a matter for the jury to estimate, in whose province it would be to draw or refuse to draw the inference. But if facts appear which reasonably explain the accident in a manner involving no negligence for which the defendant is responsible, the foundation for the inference is excluded.”  
        
       
      
    10 On appeal FM did not eventually seek to press any case that, contrary to the trial judge’s findings, the installer of the muffler, the second opponent Cameron Turner, was responsible for its failure. FM’s case was essentially to rely on that second explanation for the muffler’s failure as constituting “facts … which reasonably explain the accident [the muffler’s failure] in a manner involving no negligence for which the defendant is responsible”. This was said to exclude the foundation for any inference of negligence from the fact of that failure.  
     
      
    11 At the conclusion of the hearing, leave to appeal was granted. What follows is the disposition of that appeal. I start by recording the salient facts, which are essentially uncontroversial.  
     
      
       
      SALIENT FACTS  
      
    12 The claimants, Mr Thomas and Mr Watt, were joint owners of a Mariner 34 cruiser known as “Como Lady” (the boat).  
     
      
    13 The boat was moored at Pittwater.  
     
      
    14 The boat was fitted with water lift mufflers to both its port and starboard engines.  
     
      
    15 In October-November 1999 the boat had undergone a major overhaul at the hands of the second opponent, Mr Turner, and this overhaul included the installation of the port and starboard water-lift mufflers manufactured by the first opponent, FM.  
     
      
    16 On 17 December 2001, the claimants decided to take the boat down to Sydney Harbour.  
     
      
    17 In previous days Mr Watt had checked the oil and coolant in the engines. To do so, he had taken up the floorboards, and had not noticed any water in the hull. The boat was fitted with bilge pumps.  
     
      
    18 Before setting out on 17 December, Mr Watt started and warmed up the motors, his usual practice. It was about a 2.5 hour trip to Sydney, at about 10-12 knots.  
     
      
    19 The boat proceeded up the harbour to just near Taronga Zoo, where Mr Watt brought the boat “back to idle” as a ferry approached. As he did this the starboard motor stopped. Mr Watt thought it “had got hot from the trip down”. He was unable to restart the motor.  
     
      
    20 Using the port motor, Mr Watt manoeuvred the boat to Little Sirius Cove and picked up a mooring.  
     
      
    21 He then cut the motor and he and the others on board had lunch.  
     
      
    22 After a while, Mr Watt was told something and went to investigate. He saw water coming into the boat through the “drain holes”. This was “not normal”. The boat was “sinking from the back”.  
     
      
    23 Mr Watt thought about trying to beach the boat, but because of the amount of water coming in, he decided it was best for everybody to get off. The water police were rung and all four on board jumped into the water.  
     
      
    24 Mr Watt watched the boat sink stern first.  
     
      
    25 The boat was “boomed” to prevent leakage of its fuel into the harbour.  
     
      
    26 The next day the boat was raised under the supervision of Mr Box from Club Marine, the boat’s insurer (who later gave evidence as an expert marine engineer). The boat was then taken to Rose Bay for valuation.  
     
      
    27 The claimants claimed against FM and also Cameron Turner in negligence, and against FM only, in the alternative, under ss74B and 74D TPA. The claimants also claimed breach by the second opponent of the Fair Trading Act, but this is not at issue on appeal. On 24 October 2005 a notice of discontinuance was filed with respect to Mr Turner, who therefore played no part in the appeal.  
     
      
    28 The claimants’ loss of $58,342.35 was agreed by the two opponents during the hearing at first instance.  
     
      
    29 While the precise cause of the failure of the muffler was in issue, that it failed was not. The muffler, one of two, was made of fibreglass and was in two parts, a body and base, joined by a flange, also of fibreglass. The starboard muffler came apart when water entered the delaminating bonded flange of the muffler, through a process called “wicking”; see elaboration below under “The Primary Judgment”.  
     
      
    30 The relevant provisions of the TPA are set out below: 
     
      
       
        
        74B. Actions in respect of unsuitable goods  
         
        (1) Where:  
         
         a. a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods manufactured by the corporation to another person who acquires the goods for re-supply;  
          
         b. a person (whether or not the person who acquired the goods from the corporation) supplies the goods (otherwise than by way of sale by auction) to a consumer;  
          
         c. the goods are acquired by the consumer for a particular purpose that was, expressly or by implication, made known to the corporation, either directly, or through the person from whom the consumer acquired the goods or a person by whom any antecedent negotiations in connexion with the acquisition of the goods were conducted;

      The primary judgment  
      
    31 Having considered all the documentary evidence and the evidence of the witnesses, the trial judge concluded on the balance of probabilities that:  
     
      
      (a) On 17 December 2001, the claimants’ boat, while moored at Little Sirius Cove around lunchtime, starting taking in water at such a rate that the boat quickly sank.  
      (b) The water entered the boat via the starboard engine muffler which had partly come apart between the base or flange of the body of the muffler and the flange of the base of the muffler, both pieces having been joined by bonded fibreglass in the manufacturing process.  
      (c) The water entered the bonded flange of the muffler through a process called “wicking”.  
      (d) The ingress of the water between the two “mating surfaces” had caused a “delamination” or debonding, in parts sufficient to allow the water to flood, notwithstanding the relatively low pressure at which the muffler operates.  
      (e) It is not clear whether the fibreglass bonding delaminated allowing the “wicking” of the water in the first instance, causing further delamination, or the wicking occurred first, causing the delamination by the egress of the water.  
      (f) Both the starboard and port mufflers (the latter did not leak and was in sound condition when inspected by Mr Box on 18 December 2001) were suspended by three hoses – two input hoses from the boat motor and one exhaust hose – such that the muffler body and base were suspended above, but not attached to, the hull of the boat, either by self-tapping screws or otherwise.  
      (g) The running of the motor caused the muffler to vibrate, but that vibration was not causative of the splitting of the starboard muffler base from its body that allowed water to being to “wick” its way between the mating surfaces.  
      I interpolate here that this finding ((g) above) has some significance for one of the two theories for the cause of the muffler failure, based not on poor fibreglass bonding at the flange, but on a theory advanced by Dr Scheirs, FM’s expert, when cross-examined. He said it was due to loss of integrity and deterioration in a “gel coat”, which he said was due to vibration, at least in part.  
      (h) The splitting of the base of the starboard muffler from the body was a gradual process that occurred between the muffler’s installation by the second defendant, Mr Turner, two years previously and 17 December 2001, culminating in the division of the base and the body of the muffler on that day to such an extent that sea water was able to enter the bilge of the boat and ultimately sink it (judgment, WB, 26-27).  
      
    32 After making these findings, the trial judge emphasised that the claimants bore the onus (judgment, WB, 28) and that the evidence disclosed that no expert or the manufacturer could give a clear and unequivocal reason for the muffler’s failure. The trial judge appeared to find significance in the fact that the port muffler, also manufactured by FM, was installed at the same time as the starboard muffler and in the same manner (supported only by three hoses), yet it did not fail. Indeed according to Mr Box it was intact with no leaking when he examined it (judgment, WB, 28).  
     
      
    33 The trial judge then commented that “the number of reasons or possible reasons advanced by the experts for the muffler’s failure were considerable” and can be taken from the written submissions of Mr Turner as follows:  
     
      
      (a) The interface between the body and the base failed and was weak.  
      (b) Water came from the inside of the muffler to the outside.  
      (c) Water came from outside the leading edge of the muffler to the inside.  
      (d) Flexing of the flange.  
      (e) The form of construction (there being no fibres in parts going across the interface).  
      (f) Catastrophic event or number of small events.  
      (g) Poor adhesion.  
      (h) Overpressure.  
      (i) Inadequate construction/ poor manufacture.  
      (j) Loss of integrity/ deterioration of the gel coat.  
      (k) Backfire.  
      (l) Dropping a spanner on the edge of the muffler.  
      (m) Removal of the gel coat by being subject to chipping or stress or mechanical interference.  
      (n) Inadequate construction of the muffler at the base.  
      (o) Normal pressure resulted in delamination of the base (judgment WB, 28-29).  
      
    34 I interpolate here that the trial judge made no attempt to relate the various supposedly separate reasons for failure to either or both of the only two explanations for that failure. Nor did he group those supposedly separate reasons as they bore upon, or were elements of, the only two possible explanations. In determining the cause of the muffler’s failure, not on the basis of a clear and unequivocal reason, but on the correct test of the balance of probabilities, that should have been done.  
     
      
    35 The trial judge dealt with the question of breach of duty on the premise that there was no doubt that the manufacturer FM owed the claimants a duty of care.  
     
      
    36 The trial judge discounted the evidence of Mr Box, who was a self-employed surveyor, assessor and insurance loss adjuster, a certified naval architect. Mr Box had identified the cause of the muffler’s failure as a failure of design and manufacture by FM, rather than a problem with the installation. He discounted Mr Box and his conclusions on the basis that Mr Box had not explained how the design and manufacture of the muffler were inadequate or involved a defect. Neither did any of the other experts, according to the trial judge. Thus he concluded that there was no evidence of what FM could or should have reasonably done in the manufacture of the muffler to prevent the delamination at its base (judgment WB, 31).  
     
      
    37 The claimants tendered a report of Dr Graham Edward from the School of Physics and Materials Engineering, Monash University dated 7 October 2003, his expertise being in relation to polymers including polymer recycling and degradation. The trial judge however stated that he did not attribute “great weight” to the conclusions of Dr Edward as to the defects in the flange and its bonding because of his limited expertise. This was on the basis that Dr Edward had conceded in cross-examination that:  
     
      
      (i) His expertise was in polymers.  
      (ii) He was not familiar with the manner of constructing this type of muffler.  
      (iii) He was not given and did not seek any information about how the muffler was constructed, and 
      (iv) He could only “surmise” how the muffler was made (judgment WB, 32-33).  
      
    38 The trial judge concluded that without “convincing evidence” as to the actual defect in the design and manufacturing process and what could or should have been done to correct it, he could not find that FM breached its duty of care to the claimants (judgment WB, 33).  
     
      
    39 Although the claim in negligence against Mr Turner is now of no relevance to this appeal, certain findings remain of significance. The trial judge concluded that he was not convinced that Mr Gorman, a director of FM, whose evidence he had otherwise accepted, had given precise instructions to the second opponent, Mr Turner, to the effect that the muffler must be secured to the boat by a “four point fix” (judgment WB, 34). I interpolate a “four point fix” was by way of four bolts in the circumference of the flange whereby the body of the muffler is secured to its base via the flange.  
     
      
    40 Mr Gorman impressed the trial judge as a witness, particularly his belief in the integrity of his product (judgment WB, 34).  
     
      
    41 In any case the trial judge had regard to the fact that:  
     
      
      (a) Mr Box did not think that the four screws would have prevented the delamination,  
      (b) The muffler was secured by the three hoses, its own weight and its position in the boat, and  
      (c) Mr Box had experience of a muffler having delaminated in circumstances where it was secured (judgment WB, 34).  
      
    42 Thus while acknowledging that Mr Turner had a duty to the claimants to install a muffler in such a manner as to prevent damage, in light of that evidence, the trial judge was not convinced that this duty had been breached (judgment WB, 34).  
     
      
    43 I interpolate that this conclusion has implications for the second theory based on deterioration of the gel coat. Dr Scheirs gave evidence that wicking was the cause of the water entry causing in time delamination. His evidence was that this would have been made less likely by reinforcement around the base such as through fasteners or a circular clamp or thicker flange or additional matting (transcript WB, 167.20-168.32). His evidence on the use of screws was that it would have stopped the muffler deflecting under vibration and would ultimately have protected the gel coat from chipping so letting water in. The following passage reflects that conclusion:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So the screws would stop the deflection, is that what you are saying?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. But the screws wouldn’t stop water damage from chipping of the gel coat, would they?  
         
        A. It would stop the chipping of the gel coat because it can’t move.”  
        
       
      
    44 Finally, in relation to the s74D claim under the Trade Practices Act, it was common ground that the proper test was that enunciated by Sackville J in Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (2003) FCA 36 and on appeal unanimously upholding the decision of Sackville J, subnom Medtel Pty Ltd v Courtney (2003) FCASC 151. In Medtel (supra) the court applied a “reasonableness” test. Thus the goods would not be of merchantable quality under s74D unless they were as fit for purposes for which they were commonly bought as “it is objectively reasonable to expect”.  
     
      
    45 The trial judge found that because the experts, principally Dr Edward, were unable to comment on the process of manufacture and unable to give an opinion as to what could have and should have been done by FM in the manufacture of the muffler to prevent delamination and premature failure, he was not convinced that FM had breached s74D (judgment WB, 37-38).  
     
      
    46 The same reasons were held to apply to s74B TPA; that is, the claimants’ expert evidence did not establish what was wrong with FM’s manufacturing process that rendered the muffler not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was applied, within the meaning of s74B (judgment WB, 38).  
     
      
    47 Accordingly, the trial judge entered judgment for both the first and second opponents against the claimants (judgment WB, 39).  
     
      
       
      DISPOSITION  
      
    48 I consider that once the installer’s liability is put aside and the second explanation refuted by FM’s own principal, this was not a case in which, in the ordinary affairs of mankind, failure of the muffler was likely to occur without some fault on the part of the manufacturer. Moreover, I consider that the expert evidence strongly supported that conclusion, for reasons I explain below.  
     
      
    49 There was no challenge to the trial judge’s conclusion that the installer could not be liable in negligence (WB, 34). Here the fact of the failure of the muffler with its consequences more readily permits an inference of negligence on the part of the manufacturer to be drawn. It is however rebuttable by a tenable explanation equally consistent with negligence or its absence. That requires consideration of the explanations proffered by the manufacturer and the manner of their assessment by the trial judge, but applying the proper test for the plaintiff’s onus; proof on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    50 Evidence was called by the claimants’ qualified naval marine engineer, Mr Box. His evidence was clear and unequivocal. It was in essence that the failure of the muffler was due to the inadequate construction of the base of the muffler, but he does give further explanation of that. The evidence given by Mr Box is set out in two places in the trial judge’s reasons (WB, 18-19 and 30-31).  
     
      
    51 Thus at 18-19 the trial judge records the following evidence given by Mr Box:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Foreshore Marine waterlift has not been properly manufactured to withstand the pressures imposed upon it. The strength of the bond in the fibre reinforced plastic laminate has been inadequate for the purpose for which it was intended and has resulted in leakage and ultimately in failure. The failure of the waterlift is due to a manufacturing defect and not an installation problem.  
         
         
        The waterlift should be reinforced to withstand the exhaust and hydraulic pressures that are expected of it, without relying on any external clamps or fastenings. If such fastenings are required, then the design and construction is at fault. If any modifications are required for installation then in my opinion, these precautions should be clearly marked on the waterlift and explicit warnings and instructions be supplied with every waterlift manufactured. No such written instructions are currently provided.”  
        
       
      
    52 It is true that Mr Box does not deal with precisely why the strength of the bond of the fibre reinforced plastic laminate was inadequate but simply points to that fact. However, the second paragraph quoted above refutes any suggestion that the explanation for the failure lay in faulty installation. The primary reason is that extra clamps or fastenings should have been unnecessary as the water-lift should be reinforced to withstand the exhaust and hydraulic pressures that are expected of it without reliance on clamps or fastenings.  
     
      
    53 If further reason were required, it is found in the fact that no written warning had been provided of the necessity for such fastenings to the installer nor any precise instruction even oral. The trial judge stated that Mr Gorman (the principal of FM whom the trial judge described as a “witness who impresses me overall, particularly his belief in the integrity of his product”) did not convince him that “precise instructions were given by Mr Gorman” that “the mufflers must be secured to the boat by a ‘four point fix’” (WB, 34). The “four point fix” refers to the suggestion from Mr Scheirs, who was FM’s own expert witness, that there should have been four screws or bolts reinforcing the base to the flange (WB, 286-7). I shall return to the relevance of that matter when dealing with the second explanation advanced by FM for the failure of the muffler, namely, loss of integrity or deterioration of the gel coat due to deflection in the flange which caused a leak.  
     
      
    54 In any event, Mr Box himself discounted the need to secure the muffler with screws, as the trial judge expressly recognised in his record of his evidence (WB, 30):  
     
      
       
        
        “The vessel (now called “Lady”) was viewed on its mooring at Drummoyne on the 6th May 2003. The new owner has fitted another Foreshore Marine waterlift to replace the failed one. He stated that Foreshore Marine advised him screw the waterlift flanges to the base. This has been done with three small self-tapping screws, equally spaced around the circumference of the flange (see photo below). These screws will not prevent the flange from delaminating. The distance between the screws is greater that the distance between the area of leakage detailed in Mr Pilcher’s report (Page 2 Comment No 5). As previously stated, the  
        strength of the bond in the flange should be 
          
        designed and manufactured to withstand the internal pressures and not require any extra securing to prevent failure 
        ”. [emphasis added]  
        
       
      
    55 Thus while it is true to say that Mr Box does not identify the precise mechanism of failure through faulty design and manufacture, in the sense that he does not identify each element contributing to the delamination, he does not need to do so. Put simply, the muffler should not have come apart in the way it did, it was clearly a safety hazard undermining the integrity of the boat. It was nothing to the point that the portside muffler had to that date not come apart. That may have just been luck. What was and remained lacking from FM was any explanation for the delamination at least equally consistent with the presence or absence of negligence on the part of FM.  
     
      
    56 But in any event, evidence was given by the claimants’ expert Dr Edward in his report as to that precise process of delamination and what could have averted it. His evidence was accurately summarised by the trial judge (at WB, 31) which I quote below:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Poor bonding between the body and base flange (paragraph 5);  
         
         
        (b) The interface seems to have been ‘resin poor’ (paragraph 5);  
         
         
        (c) The fibres did not breach the interface as they should have done to supply optimum strength (paragraph 5);  
         
         
        (d) The interface was ‘weak’ (paragraph 12);  
         
         
        (e) The interface was considerably weaker than the remainder of the muffler (paragraph 14);  
         
         
        (f) The design of the muffler was not suited to any application which would involve any appreciable pressure (paragraph 15);  
         
         
        (g) The fibres were not lying in the direction best suited to accommodate the in plane membrane stresses expected (paragraph 15);  
         
         
        (h) The flange of the mufflers was a ‘natural plane of weakness’ (paragraph 15).  
        
       
      
    57 I have earlier referred to Dr Edward’s particular expertise in polymers. The trial judge stated that “in view of the limited expertise of this witness, and his lack of any information on the manufacture of the muffler in question (and others like it by the First Defendant) I do not attribute great weight as to his conclusions set out above” (WB, 33).  
     
      
    58 With respect, given the evidence of Mr Box who was expert on marine construction generally, Dr Edward’s expertise filled any gap that might have been left by Mr Box. Dr Edward’s expertise was precisely directed to that gap, being the polymer bonding and its delamination. It was never shown how Dr Edward’s readily conceded lack of information on the manufacture of the muffler generally undermined his capacity to give evidence on that bonding; nor why his evidence was not supported by Mr Box’s evidence given that it was wholly consistent with it.  
     
      
    59 Dr Edward explained precisely how the bond failed to withstand the internal pressures which Mr Box said it should have withstood. Nowhere in the evidence was there any indication that knowledge of the process of manufacture of the muffler was necessary for his evidence on bonding to have any reliability. In fact his evidence was precisely based upon what the trial judge referred to as “his knowledge of fibreglass constructions”. This was the very matter in question given that the muffler was constructed out of fibreglass including both the base and the body as well as the flange between them.  
     
      
    60 As I have said, FM never advanced any explanation consistent with the absence of negligence on its part, though it belatedly attempted an explanation based on failure of the gel coat, an explanation which Mr Gorman of FM himself disavowed.  
     
      
    61 I have already referred to Mr Scheirs’ theory, elicited in cross-examination. It was based on assumed chipping of the Flowcoat gel or its removal by reason of flexing of the muffler due to failure to connect the flange to the body with screws, whereby water would or could have penetrated by the process of wicking (WB, 280-284).  
     
      
    62 Mr Gorman, when asked about Flowcoat gel, gave the following evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        “JOHNSON: Q. So once that is completed, it is painted, the muffler is then painted using what?  
         
        A. A product called Flowcoat.  
         
         
        Q. You described it, you agreed with Mr Box, that’s cosmetic?  
         
        A. Yes, it is.  
         
         
        Q. Does it form or does it provide any form of seal ---  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. --- on it. The seal that you say is formed by that two layer approach, first bonding the circular part of the base into the body?  
         
        A. Mm-hm.  
         
         
        Q. And then the fibreglassing of that circular part?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. To the flange?  
         
        A. Mm-hm. (WB, 246.17-.36)  
        
       
      
    63 Mr Gorman’s evidence focussed on the necessity as he saw it for making sure “the muffler is secure” by “a standard four point fix” (WB, 248.43-.51). But that necessity for securing the muffler, even if accepted, cannot avail FM in the absence of written or precise instructions as to installation being so carried out. It is therefore not an explanation consistent with the absence of negligence on the part of FM.  
     
      
    64 The trial judge was in error in concluding that there was no breach of FM’s duty of care to the claimants, and thus no negligence. To the contrary, the evidence of the experts as well as Mr Gorman’s own evidence leads inevitably to the conclusion that there was a breach of that duty of care. Whilst the inability to call lay or expert evidence showing the precise way in which something has happened is not necessary fatal (see for example Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst (1940) 64 CLR 538 at 563-4, 569) and where but slight evidence should suffice to persuade the trier of fact that liability has been sheeted home to a defendant where the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of that party, this is not even such a case.  
     
      
    65 Here the explanation is clear enough. The trial judge’s setting out of some 15 possible reasons for the failure ([33] above), with respect, was apt to mislead. Thus he breaks down into separate elements the two possible explanations as if each element constituted a separate reason. It does not. To these were added what are more accurately consequences of the failure, not explanations for it, such as water entry (elements (b) and (c)). Then there are added supposedly competing explanations for which there is simply no evidence, such as a dropped spanner or backfire (elements (l) and (k)). It is clear enough that the explanation the subject of Dr Edward’s evidence and that of Mr Box is in fact a combination of paragraphs (a), (b), (g), (i), (k), (n) and (o). It should have been treated as the explanation to be accepted on the balance of probabilities being an explanation not consistent with absence of negligence on the part of FM.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    66 The claimants have established that FM breached its duty of care in the carrying out of the manufacture of the muffler which failed, so that FM was liable to them in negligence.  
     
      
       
      Trade Practice Act 
       – ss 74B and 74D  
      
    67 Accepting for both provisions the test in Medtel that “fitness of purpose of the goods in question is to be measured against what it was objectively reasonable to expect, in terms of fitness for the purpose, in all the relevant circumstances”, that test is amply satisfied here. The reasons earlier set out in relation to that element of breach of the duty of care in negligence apply equally to ss74B and 74D. Accordingly, the trial judge was, with respect, in error in failing to find FM liable to the claimants under both s74B and s74D of the TPA. This was because the polymer bond for this particular muffler, the product of the process of design and manufacture which FM applied to it, was inadequate, resulting in leakage and its ultimate failure. Hence the muffler was neither reasonably fit for its known purpose nor of merchantable quality.  
     
      
       
      OVERALL CONCLUSION AND ORDERS  
      
    68 I conclude that the claimants succeed in their appeal and propose that the following orders be made:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal allowed.  
      (2) Set aside the judgment and orders made by Sorby DCJ on 1 March 2005.  
      (3) In lieu thereof, order that judgment for $58,342.35 be entered for the appellants against the first respondent.  
      (4) The first respondent to pay the costs of the appellants on appeal and in the proceedings below but to have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act, 1951, if otherwise entitled thereto.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I have the benefit of reading the draft of judgment of Studdert J and I wish only to add some brief comment concerning an argument advanced by the appellant in support of Ground 3. 
     
      
    2 In a written submission, it was contended that  
     
      
       
        
        “a finding of not guilty was not dependent on any finding of fact, but rather the finding that the Crown had failed to exclude a reasonable hypothesis that either the appellant believed that his conduct was necessary to defend himself or that what the appellant did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them to be.” 
        
       
      
    3 The submission implies a disjoinder of the jury’s fact-finding function from the application of the stated alternative tests. The legal tests are not applied in a vacuum but upon the facts as the jury have found them to be. When the learned trial judge invited the jury to first determine the facts, he would have been understood as doing no more than guiding the jury in the proper application to their task. 
     
      
    4 As Studdert J has demonstrated, the directions in his Honour’s charge to the jury made it clear that the burden and standard of proof required the Crown to exclude the reasonable possibility of the appellant having acted in self defence. 
     
      
    5 I agree with the judgment of Studdert J and the order which he proposes. 
     
      
    6 STUDDERT J: The appellant, Frederick Harris, was found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of Anthony Wright following trial in the District Court. After conviction he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years six months with a non parole period of four years eleven months. The appellant now appeals against his conviction. 
     
      
    7 The deceased died on 7 October 2002 but the injuries sustained by him and which implicitly the jury found causative of death occurred on 30 September 2002 at the Hurstville RSL Club. The injuries sustained included fractures to the lower outside part of the left eye socket and haemorrhages later detected established traumatic injury to the brain. Dr Duflou, who conducted the post mortem, concluded that the cause of death was a subdural haemorrhage from head injury. 
     
      
    8 The issues at trial were: 
     
      
       
      (i) whether any blows inflicted by the appellant were causative of the death of the deceased; 
       
       
      (ii) self defence. 
       
      
    9 Before considering the grounds of appeal, I will review briefly the evidence as to what occurred between the appellant and the deceased. 
     
      
    10 The evidence at trial established that at about 6.30 pm on 30 September 2002 the deceased encountered the appellant when he was in the process of leaving the club with a friend, Andrew Firth. The appellant approached the two men and asked Mr Firth for a cigarette. The request was declined and, according to Mr Firth, the appellant then said, “Okay, fine. Fuck you.” The deceased and Mr Firth had barely left the club when the deceased turned and returned to it. According to Mr Firth, the deceased did not respond to his caution: “Tony, don’t do it. It’s not worth it.” Mr Firth said that the deceased proceeded to a position about a foot from the appellant. Mr Firth said he saw the appellant punch the deceased twice in the face, the blows being thirty to forty seconds apart. The deceased’s glasses were knocked off and his skin was lacerated under the eye. Mr Firth did not see the deceased being at all aggressive. 
     
      
    11 Graeme Stepto was sitting with his friends, Desmond Parnell and Dimitri Kaye, a short distance away from where the deceased was when he was punched. The appellant approached their group for a cigarette. According to Mr Stepto, he looked out of the corner of his eye and saw a man, who he described as “black coloured”, throw a punch at the deceased. (There is no issue but that he was endeavouring to describe the appellant.) Mr Stepto was aware that the deceased walked up to the appellant and said something but he did not know what it was that he said. Mr Stepto saw the appellant throw a second punch and then run from the club. When asked, he said that after the first blow the deceased just stood there stunned but he fell to the ground after the second blow. In cross examination Mr Stepto said that the deceased seemed aggressive and spoke loudly. In re-examination, Mr Stepto was asked what he observed that led him to say that the deceased was aggressive towards the accused. The response (T 46) was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “He just seemed angry when he come back inside, when he – when he come over after the guy had asked me for a cigarette. He just seemed – just the way – I could hear his voice. I can’t recall what he said but he just seemed angry.” 
        
       
      
    12 Mr Parnell said he heard the dark man say “Can you leave me alone. F…ing leave me alone.” He said, “The next thing I looked around and some fellow’s on the floor and that was it.” The fellow on the floor, he said, was the deceased. 
     
      
    13 Mr Kaye said that the deceased’s assailant had his back to Mr Kaye and he could not see the deceased, nor did he hear anything said. However, he saw the appellant punch the deceased twice and the deceased then fell before being assisted into a chair. When asked specifically whether he could see what the deceased was doing immediately before he was hit, he said he did not because the appellant was between the deceased and himself. He did say that after the deceased was punched the first time he raised his head again and then he was punched a second time. 
     
      
    14 The duty manager at the club was John Truman. On the day after the incident which the above witnesses described, he said that he saw the appellant enter the club and he asked him to leave. The appellant spoke to him about what had happened the previous evening. According to Mr Truman, the appellant said to him:  
     
      
       
        
        “Man, you know me. I’m a friendly guy. He just kept hassling me, man. Then he just called me ‘Boy’ and I just snapped. He might as well call me nigger or slave… I saw these guys leave and one of them had a Sharkies jumper on and I’m a Sharkies fan. I said to him that ‘I’m a Sharkies fan, man.’ I asked the bloke for a cigarette and he said, ‘No, I’ve only two left.’ The other bloke said, ‘We don’t have to give you fucking anything.’ I told him to get fucked. I went back inside the club and went to a table with another five blokes and I said ‘Good evening gentlemen of the round table, how are you? I then asked one of them for a Winnie. Whilst I was in there talking to them, this bloke came back inside and touched me from behind. He started to say something and I said ‘Hey man, just fucking leave me alone.’ He called me ‘boy’ and I just snapped.” 
        
       
      
    15 When spoken to by Constable Chaplin on 1 October 2002 the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I had a run-in with another man. He got in my face and called me ‘boy’. I snapped and hit him.” 
        
       
      
    16 The appellant was then placed under arrest and participated in an electronically recorded interview. In the course of that interview, he said that the word that  
     
      
       
        
        “just made me snap was he called me ‘a boy’. That’s as bad as…calling me a nigger or a slave. I am not a racist person. I do not like racist people.” 
        
       
      
    17 The appellant said in the ERISP that the deceased was standing a foot away from him. He said he hit him twice in the face with a closed fist. Towards the end of the ERISP the appellant was asked:  
     
      
       
        
        “Do you believe you were acting in self defence?”  
        
       
       
      He responded:  
       
       
        
        “Absolutely, and not only that. I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m yeah, I’m acting in self defence and I’m acting you know against racism. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. …How do you justify the punches there being self defence? Were you in any physical danger? Did you feel… 
         
        A. I don’t know… 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Threatened? 
         
        A. I, hey, I felt that I was threatened big time. I mean I don’t know what his intentions were. Why he came up to me to harass me or anything. All I knew is that I had to do something because of the fact is he had no reason to come up to me like that, sir, had no reason whatsoever. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he make any physical gestures? Did he say for instance, raise his fists, did he have anything in his hands that you felt that with… Did he threaten you with any physical harm? Did he say anything? 
         
        A. Oh, he… he might have. Like I said, you know, I did not catch every word that he was saying. The only thing that…that made me snap was that word. The only thing that that made me snap was that word. I know that he was aggressive and I know that, um, you know… even the management knows that he is a problem…” 
        
       
      
    18 The deceased was taken to hospital on 30 September 2002 but not admitted. A CAT scan was ordered and eventually performed on 2 October 2002, but before that scan the deceased attended the Hurstville Police Station at about 6.30 pm on 1 October 2002 and made a statement, which he signed and which reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. 
        
       
       
        
        The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable for prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false, or do not believe to be true. 
        
       
       
        
        2. I am 61 years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On the 30th of September 2002 I was with a friend of mine Andrew Firth at the Hurstville RSL. About 6.30pm we were walking out through the front foyer of the club to leave. A man approached myself and Andrew and said, ‘We go for the same team, give us a cigarette.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Andrew said, ‘I’ve only got a few to last me the week.’ 
        
       
       
        
        The man said, ‘Fuck off.’ He then turned around and walked back into the club. 
        
       
       
        
        4. At this stage Andrew and I were standing at the top of the stairs. I said, ‘Just a minute, I will be back.’ I turned and walked back into the R.S.L. to try and defuse the incident that had just happened. I wanted to talk to the man to let him know that he should calm down and not be so aggressive. 
        
       
       
        
        Andrew said, ‘Don’t worry about it.’ 
        
       
       
        
        5. I walked back in through the front doors of the club and approached the man who had asked us for the cigarette. He was standing near a table of men. I went to him and stood about a metre from him. I said, ‘You should not ask for favours from people and then get angry when you [are] refused. Especially when you don’t know them.’ The man did not say anything back to me. 
        
       
       
        
        6. I looked at the table of men and then I felt a blow to my face. My head was rocked backwards and I saw a fist out of the corner of my eye. I felt another punch land on my face and I fell back a little. I noticed that my glasses had been smashed on my face and the frame was on the ground. I noticed blood was dripping from my face and onto my shirt. The left side of my face felt a little numb. This shocked me as I have never been involved in anything like this before. 
        
       
       
        
        7. I saw the man that had hit me walking out the front doors of the R.S.L. I tried to find my glasses on the ground. I was approached by several people who tried to help me. John, the supervisor came up to me and told me that the ambulance was on it’s way. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The man that hit me was about 30 years old, he was dark skinned and had an accent. He was of lean build and about 185cm tall. 
        
       
       
        
        9. I was taken to St. George Hospital where I was treated for my injuries. As a result of this assault I have received a fractured cheek bone, a cut under my left eye and several cuts to my upper lip. Also, my glasses were smashed and I would like compensation for them. 
        
       
       
        
        10. I did not give any person any permission to assault me in any way.” 
        
       
      
    19 This brings me to the grounds of appeal, the first two of which concern the admission into evidence of the above statement of the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the learned trial judge to provide reasons for admitting into evidence the prior representations contained in the statement of the deceased 
       
      
    20 At the time that the grounds of appeal were filed and, indeed, at the time counsel for the appellant prepared written submissions, the appellant did not have a copy of the reasons of the trial judge for allowing into evidence the statement made by the deceased.  
     
      
    21 The ruling allowing the introduction of the statement of the deceased was a significant ruling. At the time of making that ruling, his Honour indicated he would state his reasons for it later. 
     
      
    22 The appellant was entitled to have reasons for the ruling given in the application of the fundamental principle that justice must only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done: see R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 per Spigelman CJ at [42]. See also Saulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 per McHugh JA at 280. See also Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 and the joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [21]. 
     
      
    23 By the time of the hearing of the appeal, his Honour’s reasons were available, so Ground 1 was not pursued. The reasons why it was admitted into evidence require consideration under Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the prior representation contained in the statement of the deceased, Tony Wright 
       
      
    24 The Crown tendered the statement of the deceased, relying upon s 65 of the Evidence Act and in particular on s 65(2)(b) and (c). 
     
      
    25 Section 65(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.” 
        
       
      
    26 Part 2 para 4 of the Dictionary defines “unavailability of persons” and provides relevantly here: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the person is dead” 
        
       
      
    27 Section 65(2) makes provision for the admissibility of evidence of previous representations in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 The ruling at the trial which attracts attention in the present context was made after extensive argument. Counsel appearing at the trial for the appellant acknowledged (T 121, 2 September 2004) he did not join issue with the majority of what was said in the statement, but proceeded: 
     
      
       
        
        “What our objection is really aimed at here are those particular asserted facts that really go to negative the aspect of his aggression or ill temper.” 
        
       
      
    29 Doubtless this objection was taken because of the issue of self defence. Of course, at the time that the judge determined that the statement was admissible, the appellant had not given evidence at his trial but the ERISP had been introduced and the issue of self defence was raised there.  
     
      
    30 His Honour’s reasons for admitting the statement of the deceased into evidence are short and were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Crown Prosecutor tendered the statement made by the deceased to police at Hurstville Police Station on 1 October 2002 and asked that the statement be admitted into evidence. He relied on paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-section (2) of s.65 of the Evidence Act for admission of the statement into evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The accused’s counsel objected to the admission of the deceased’s statement into evidence. He submitted that the statement should be rejected because: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it was a statement of one of the two ‘protagonists’ involved in the incident; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it was not made ‘shortly’ after the incident; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) it was not made in circumstances that made it unlikely that the representations contained in it were fabrications; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) it was not made in circumstances that made it highly probable that the representations contained in it were reliable. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. I decided to admit the deceased’s statement into evidence because: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) the fact that it was a statement of one of the two people involved in the incident is not a reason (in my view) to refuse admission of it into evidence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) as it was made within 24 hours after the incident, it was made (in my view) shortly after the incident; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) the circumstances in which it was made, namely a statement made to police in a police station as to what had occurred in an incident, which statement was likely to be the basis of the possible charging of the accused with an offence, made it unlikely that the representations contained in it were fabrications, and made it highly probabl[e] that the representations contained in it were reliable; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) the representations contained in it were relevant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (5) the representations contained in it were highly probative; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (6) although the accused’s counsel did not rely upon ss. 135(a) or 137 of the Act, the probative value of the representations contained in the deceased’s statement was not outweighed, substantially or otherwise, (in my view) by the danger that those representations might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused, as, particularly, there is little difference between what the deceased told police in his statement and what the accused told police when he was interviewed.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 Mr Dhanji submitted that the statement ought not to have been admitted under s 65(2)(b) because  
     
      
       
      (i) it had not been made “shortly after” the events described, 
       
       
      (ii) the circumstances in which it was made were such as did not render it unlikely that what was said was a fabrication. 
       
      
    32 Section 65(2)(b) imposes time restraints on the admissibility of evidence. Those restraints are expressed alternatively. The representation under consideration is to be made when the asserted fact occurred, or it is to be made “shortly after” that occurred. 
     
      
    33 There has been no attempt in the statute itself or in the cases to which the Court was taken to define what is meant by “shortly after”. In Conway v The Queen (2000) 98 FCR 204, the introduction of the words “shortly after” was seen as a significant departure from the position prior to the introduction of the Act. In their joint judgment, Miles, von Doussa and Weinberg JJ said (at p 239-241 [123], [133]) 
     
      
       
        
        “[123] The word ‘when’ in s 65(2)(b) of the Act encompasses this notion of strict contemporaneity. The introduction of the expression ‘shortly after’ is, however, a significant departure from traditional doctrine…  
        
       
       
        
        [133] The primary objective which underlies the requirement in s 65(2)(b) of the Act that the representation be made ‘when’ or ‘shortly after’ the asserted fact occurred seems to be to ensure that the matters conveyed are either strictly contemporaneous or, if narrative of a past event, still fresh in the mind of the person recounting that narrative. The expression ‘shortly after’ makes it clear that there need not be anything like the strict contemporaneity required at common law to render the evidence admissible as res gestae.” 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Mankotia (unreported, 27 July 1998) Sperling J considered the expression: 
     
      
       
        
        “The phrase ‘shortly after’ is not defined. The legislature has chosen not to specify a time. That implies that a normative judgment is to be made dependent on the circumstances of the case. For a judgment to be made, considerations of some kind or other have to be taken into account but - as in the, case of normative judgments generally - it may be difficult or impossible to articulate in a precise way what they are. I think the predominant factor in the phrase ‘shortly after’ must be the actual time that has elapsed and whether that fits the ordinary usage of the expression ‘shortly after’ in the circumstances of the case. The judgment should, however, be influenced by the policy behind the provision. That is to put a brake on evidence being given of a recollection which may have faded in its accuracy with the passage of time. The judgment may therefore be influenced by the subject matter of the event and by how long the memory of such an event is likely to have remained clear in the mind.” 
        
       
      
    35 Levine J cited the above observation in R v Polkinghorne (1999) 108 A Crim R 189, and the approach of Sperling J and Levine J was considered to be correct in Conway ((supra) at 241 [135]). 
     
      
    36 In Williams v The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490 s 65(2)(b) was again addressed. After considering the cases to which I have referred above, Whitlam, Madgwick and Weinberg JJ said (at 502 [47]-[48]): 
     
      
       
        
        “[47] Thus, it is principally a concern to exclude concocted evidence that informs the meaning of the phrase ‘shortly after’. As noted by Sperling J in Mankotia, at [10], s 65(2)(b) ought not be regarded as simply importing a test of:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘ ... reliability at large. It is a narrower test ... [I]t is the unlikelihood of concoction to which the paragraph is directed. Whether the representor might have been honestly mistaken is immaterial.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [48] For these reasons, it would be a mistake, in determining whether a statement has been made ‘shortly after’, to over-emphasise such matters as whether the events in question were ‘fresh’ in the memory of the person making the statement. The rationale for the exception to the hearsay rule contained in s 65(2)(b) is not based only upon the necessity to ensure that the events in question may be easily recalled. Rather that provision is, as a whole, intended to allow evidence that is unlikely to be a fabrication. One condition of this is that the statements be made spontaneously during (when) or under the proximate pressure of (shortly after) the occurrence of the asserted fact…” 
        
       
      
    37 In referring to “proximate pressure” in the above passage, plainly their Honours had in mind again the question of temporal restraint. In Williams their Honours considered the lapse of five days took the representations “outside the likely temporal realm of statements that may be considered to be reliable because made spontaneously during, or under the proximal pressure of events” (at 502 [49]). 
     
      
    38 Mr Dhanji submitted that it was not open to the judge in the present case to determine that the statement of the deceased, made as it was some twenty-four hours after the event, was made “shortly after” the event the deceased described. I am not persuaded by that submission. 
     
      
    39 Mr Dhanji did not seek to argue that “shortly after” meant “immediately after”. No attempt has been made in the decided cases to prescribe the words “shortly after” by the passing of any defined period of time. Each case has to be considered having regard to its own particular circumstances. For example, as Mr Dhanji properly acknowledged in the course of his able argument, a statement made by a person recovering consciousness five days after an event may well be considered to have been made “shortly after” that event. 
     
      
    40 I have come to the conclusion that it was open to the judge in the circumstances of the present case to determine that what the deceased told the police was conveyed “shortly after” the incident he described. 
     
      
    41 In R v Ambrosoli (2002) 55 NSWLR 603 it was determined that the circumstances upon which s 65(2)2(b) and (c) focussed were the circumstances of the making of the previous representation. Mason P, with whom Hulme and Simpson JJ agreed, said this at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would therefore appear that R v Mankotia, Conway and R v Williams are at one in: 
        
       
       
        
        • focussing upon the circumstances of the making of the previous representation to determine whether it is unlikely that the representation was a fabrication or highly probable that the representation was reliable; and 
        
       
       
        
        • excluding evidence tending only to prove the asserted fact. 
        
       
       
        
        [35] In my view this is a correct approach to s 65(2)…” 
        
       
      
    42 In this case, of course, there were no prior or later statements made by the deceased that might have had any bearing upon the reliability of the circumstances of the making of the statement admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    43 It was submitted that it could not be said that the statement was made in circumstances that made it unlikely that the representations contained in it amounted to a fabrication. In particular, these matters were adverted to: 
     
      
       
      (i) that the deceased had been drinking and may have had as many as seven schooners; 
       
       
      (ii) that the deceased’s version was inherently unlikely in that he asserted he was going back “to diffuse the incident”, although the incident was for all practical purposes over by the time the deceased first left the club; 
       
       
      (iii) the deceased had an interest in seeing that the appellant was charged at the time he made the statement; 
       
       
      (iv) that he wanted to present himself as the victim and not the aggressor. 
       
      
    44 The Crown urged the contrary considerations: 
     
      
       
      (i) the level of intoxication was mild according to the ambulance officer, Christopher Roach, who attended upon the deceased at the club immediately after the attack. Ambulance Officer Roach’s assessment was that the deceased was “still quite aware of his faculties”; 
       
       
      (ii) the deceased’s version was not inherently unlikely; 
       
       
      (iii) the statement given to the police officer was a formal statement which commenced in the usual way: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable for prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe to be true.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (iv) in making his statement, the deceased would have appreciated that there were witnesses in the club that the police would interview concerning what had occurred; 
       
       
      (v) the statement was made after the deceased had had some treatment at the hospital but before the CAT scan and hence before he was in a position to appreciate the nature and extent of his injuries. 
       
      
    45 In my opinion, there is substance in the submissions advanced by the Crown and summarised above concerning those circumstances which made it unlikely that the representations in the statement were fabricated. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion, having regard to those circumstances and the reasons expressed by the judge, no error has been shown in the decision to admit the statement into evidence pursuant to s 65(2)(b). 
     
      
    47 As his Honour’s reasons illustrate, his Honour did have regard to s 135 and s 137 of the Act. It was not sought at trial, nor in this Court, to submit that the evidence ought to have been excluded under either of those sections, as his Honour found the representations in the statement were relevant and probative. Plainly they were, having regard to the issues and the evidence I have earlier reviewed. 
     
      
    48 Having concluded that the statement was admissible under s 65(2)(b), it becomes unnecessary to consider whether it was also admissible under s 65(2)(c). As Mr Dhanji acknowledged in the course of argument, if the judge was correct in admitting the statement under s 65(2)(b), there is no need to consider s 65(2)(c), and the latter sub-paragraph was not addressed in oral argument on this appeal. 
     
      
    49 For the above reasons, Ground 2 fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in that he directed the jury that they must first determine the facts before applying the test of self defence 
       
      
    50 In considering this ground it will be necessary to review closely all the instructions that the judge gave in the course of the summing up. However, the complaint relates to the final redirections which were given. It is contended that the effect of them was to distract the jury from the onus upon the Crown of excluding the relevant possibilities. Reference was made to the decision in Liberato v The Queen (1984-85) 159 CLR 507, and in particular the dicta of Brennan J at 515 and of Deane J at 519-520. The jury was not to be invited to see their task as essentially one of making a choice between the evidence relied upon by the Crown and the evidence relied upon by the accused. 
     
      
    51 The trial judge directed the jury on the issue of self defence at SU 28-31 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “As you would expect, the law recognises the right of a person to act in self defence against an attack or the threat of an attack from another person. This right arises where the person believes that his or her use of force is necessary in order to defend him or herself against the attack or the threat of an attack by another person or other people and where that person, in defending him or herself against that attack or the threat of it, uses a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them to be. 
        
       
       
        
        I must tell you that, although the word ‘defence’ appears in the phrase or expression ‘self defence’, the exercise of the right of self defence is not something that the accused person must prove. Rather it is something that the Crown must convince the jury to reject. In other words, the burden, onus or obligation, to use those interchangeable words, does not lie on the accused to prove it, it lies upon the Crown to eliminate it. The Crown may eliminate it by proving one or other or both of two things. In this trial the accused does not have to prove that he acted in his self defence against an attack or the threat of it from the deceased. The Crown must convince you beyond reasonable doubt to reject self defence. The Crown may convince you that the accused was not acting in self defence by proving beyond reasonable doubt, one or other or both of two things. Those things are, one, that the accused did not believe, at the time of doing what he did, that it was necessary for him to so act in order to defend himself; in other words, that the accused did not believe that he had to punch the deceased twice to defend himself against an attack or threat of it by the deceased; and, two, if it is reasonably possible that he had such a belief, in other words if it is reasonably possible that the accused believed that he had to do what he did in his own self defence, then nevertheless the accused’s acts were not a reasonable response to the attack upon him or the threat of it as he perceived it to be at that time. If the Crown fails to prove both of those two things, then the Crown has failed to convince you to reject self defence. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, as to the accused’s belief and his response, I tell you these two things. Firstly, as to the accused’s belief that he had to do what he did in order to protect himself against the deceased’s attack or the threat of it as he perceived it, you must consider the circumstances as the accused perceived them at that time. So, you will, as it were, stand in the shoes of the accused when he was confronted, if I may use that word, by the deceased. It is the accused’s perception that must be considered in determining whether what he did was a reasonable response to those circumstances. And the circumstances should not be looked at with the benefit of hindsight, but in the realisation that calm deliberation and decision cannot be expected in a situation such as that which the accused said he found himself to be in. If you find that the accused had or that it is reasonably possible that he may have had that belief, it does not matter that his belief was mistaken.  
        If, however, the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that his acts were necessary for his self defence, then the Crown would have eliminated self defence 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, as to the accused’s response, if you are satisfied that the accused had or it is reasonably possible that he had the belief that his acts were necessary for his self defence, then you must consider the question whether the Crown has nevertheless proved beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them to be. As to this question, even if the accused was mistaken in his perception of the relevant circumstances, if you are satisfied as to his belief in relation to those circumstances, and that his response was reasonable in those circumstances, the Crown will have failed to eliminate self defence. However, if the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s response was not a reasonable response in those circumstances, then the Crown has eliminated self defence 
        .” 
        
       
      
    52 On the following morning of the trial, the jury asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can the jury please have the definition of self defence?” 
        
       
      
    53 Having heard both counsel, the judge redirected the jury (SU 47-50) in more or less the same terms as those of his earlier directions on the issue of self defence. Then, two further notes came from the jury. 
     
      
    54 The first of these read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can an attack or threat of an attack as outlined in self defence relate to a wholly verbal attack, tirade (as said) or abuse if there is no perceived threat, belief or apprehension of physical contact or impending physical contact?” 
        
       
      
    55 The second note read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can the jury be provided with alternative wording for the phrase ‘reasonable response under self defence’ for the benefit of jury members who use English as a second language?” 
        
       
      
    56 Once again the judge listened to the submissions of counsel and then gave the following instruction (SU 55-59): 
     
      
       
        
        “Before I answer the questions that you have asked, I want to remind you of something that I said in my summing-up. I said that you consider all of the evidentiary material and decide the facts as you find them to have been at this time on this day in Hurstville RSL Club involving the deceased and the accused. I said that once you have decided the facts, you will find, I expect, that as night follows day that your verdict would flow from the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        So the first thing you have to do, as the tribunal of fact, is to decide the facts which satisfy you within the evidentiary material, so that you make a decision as to what happened between the deceased and the accused in the Hurstville RSL Club. Once you decide the facts, you then consider whether, having regard to those facts, the Crown has disproved – convinced you to eliminate – self defence. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, members of the jury, the accused in his evidence – and I am referring only to his evidence, not to the statements that he made to Mr Truman or to the police – the accused in his evidence said that when he was tapped on the shoulder by the deceased a number of things happened. One of the things was that he was abused. Another was that the deceased made a clenched fist. Another was that the deceased poked him, the accused, with a finger. Another was that the deceased stepped to block his movement when he stepped to his right to go around the accused. Another was the deceased called him a ‘boy’. Another was that the deceased, after being punched the first time, came back towards him with a clenched fist. And he told you that he had struck the deceased because he thought that the deceased was going to strike him. 
        
       
       
        
        The learned Crown prosecutor put to you that, except for the accused saying that the deceased call him a boy, the accused had not mentioned any of the other matters or factors when speaking with Mr Truman or the police. And the learned Crown prosecutor put to you that in relation to those matters or facts – that is, those other than that the deceased called him a boy – the accused had lied about them. 
        
       
       
        
        As I said to you in my summing-up, you have to decide for yourselves what transpired, what happened, between the deceased and the accused. Once you have decided that – that is, once you have decided what happened between the deceased and the accused – you then consider whether, having regard to your decision of what happened, whether the accused believed that he had to do what he did in his own self defence and whether, in doing what he did, he responded reasonably to what he perceived. 
        
       
       
        
        So that is to tell you, without considering the other evidence, just considering the accused’s evidence, what the Crown asks you to do in relation to the accused’s evidence. Now, it is not for any one of us to suggest to you how you go about deciding the facts. You have go[t] to make the decisions yourselves. You have heard the witnesses. You have heard the accused. It is for you as the judges of the facts to decide within the evidentiary material what happened between the deceased and the accused in the club. Having decided what happened, you then ask yourselves, in relation to your decision about what happened, did the accused in those circumstances believe that he had to do what he did in his own defence? And you have to ask yourselves whether, in those circumstances, his response was a reasonable one. 
        
       
       
        
        Remember, the accused does not have to prove anything. He does not have to prove that he acted in self defence. The Crown must convince you to reject self defence. In other words, the Crown must convince you beyond reasonable doubt that either the accused did not believe that he had to do what he did in his own defence, or that what he did was not a reasonable response to the situation as he perceived it to be 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Now, at the risk of further adding to what I have told you about self defence, I want to read something to you. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The questions to be asked by the jury are: (1) Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused believed that his or her conduct was necessary in order to defend him or herself, and (2) If there is, is there also a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he or she perceived them to be?’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The answer to the first question, ‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the accused believed that his or her conduct was necessary in order to defend him or herself?’ is determined from a completely subjective point of view, considering all of the personal characteristics of the accused at the time he or she did what he or she did. And that is why I said to you when you assess the situation in which the accused found himself, you stand in his shoes, viewing the situation with his eyes. That is what is called the subjective test. 
        
       
       
        
        The second question, a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he or she perceived them, is determined by an entirely objective assessment of the proportionality of the accused[‘s] response to the situation in which he or she subjectively believed him or herself to be. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown will negative self defence. In other words, eliminate it, which was the words I used in my summing-up, if it proves beyond reasonable doubt either, (1) that the accused did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to act as he or she did in his or her own defence, or (2) that what the accused did was not a reasonable response to the danger as he or she perceived it to be 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Now, it is not for a presiding judge in a criminal trial to define words that are in everyday use. The jury’s interpretation of the words that are in everyday use is for the jury’s interpretation. So, it is not appropriate that I define ‘reasonable’ and ‘response’, except to say, when considering whether a response is reasonable, as I have said to you, you consider the proportionality of the accused’s response to the situation perceived by him at the time. And response means reaction. 
        
       
       
        
        So, members of the jury, as I have said, I hope that I have not added another layer to an explanation of self defence. Remember, you first decide the facts. And only you can decide the facts. You have been given all of the evidence and, as I have said to you already, there are six versions of the incident. You have to decide, having regard to the six versions of the incident, what transpired, what happened, what occurred between the deceased and the accused in the RSL Club. Having decided what happened, what occurred, you then apply the questions related to self defence. Is there anything more I should add, Mr Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Gilson? 
        
       
       
        
        GILSON: Your Honour, I only wanted to address your Honour in relation to what your Honour said to the jury about the facts, basically accepting which version. I didn’t what your Honour to be seen to be taking the position that the jury must decide one or the other, that obviously the whole point is if they have doubt about some particular aspect of the facts, then that’s a matter for them. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That is true. Now, I hope the jury understands that it is not for me, any more than it is for the learned Crown prosecutor or learned counsel for the accused, to decide the facts. You have been presented with the facts. You twelve comprise the tribunal of fact. You make all decisions about the facts, but you have got to decide on the facts what happened between the deceased and the accused in the RSL Club. Having decided the facts, you then apply the directions of law that I have given you to those facts. 
        
       
       
        
        In the hope that I have clarified but not confused, please return to the jury room and continue your deliberations.” 
        
       
      
    57 No further direction was sought and the jury returned with its verdict nearly twenty-four hours later. 
     
      
    58 Early in the summing up the jury had been instructed that the appellant was not required to prove anything and that the onus was upon the Crown. At SU 14-15, his Honour gave this instruction after referring to the significance of the accused having given evidence at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second thing about an accused person giving evidence is that, by giving evidence, the accused person does not take upon him or herself any burden, onus or obligation, and those words are interchangeable, to prove anything. In this trial the accused gave evidence. He, like the witnesses before him, entered the witness box. He, like the witnesses before him, swore an oath on the Bible or gave an affirmation to tell the truth. By giving evidence, he became the sixteenth of the sixteen witnesses in his trial. His evidence is not any better or any worse because he is a witness in his trial. His evidence is to be considered by you in the way you consider the other witnesses’ evidence, and I will have something more to say about the witnesses evidence generally in a minute. By giving evidence, he did not take upon his shoulders any burden, onus or obligation to prove anything. In this trial the burden, onus or obligation to prove the guilt of the accused rests on the Crown from beginning to end…” 
        
       
      
    59 In the passages I have earlier recorded on the issue of self defence, and in particular in those passages to which emphasis has been added, the judge directed the jury that it was for the Crown to convince the jury to reject self defence and that the Crown had to convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that either the accused did not believe that he had to do what he did in his own defence or that what he did was not a reasonable response to the situation as he perceived it to be. 
     
      
    60 It seems to me that the directions made it clear to the jury that the burden of proof and the standard of proof required the Crown to exclude the reasonable possibility of the appellant having acted in self defence. 
     
      
    61 In R v Burt (2003) 140 A Crim R 555 Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appeal is not to be approached as a microscopic examination of everything which was said by a trial judge in an attempt to find a technical omission or error.” 
        
       
      
    62 His Honour went on to cite what had been said in the Court of Criminal in R v Ita (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 concerning r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. That rule is, to my mind, enlivened here. 
     
      
    63 I do not consider that there exists any real risk that the jury misunderstood the burden or the nature of the burden imposed upon the Crown on the issue of self defence having regard to the totality of the instruction given by the trial judge. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion, ground 3 fails. 
     
      
    65 I therefore propose for the reasons stated that the this appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    66 WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Studdert J and the order that he proposes.

      2005/656 ZENG, Yini v REGINA 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Yini Zeng, pleaded guilty upon arraignment to two charges on an indictment as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. On 24 April 2004 at Rockdale in the State of New South Wales, she did cause the death of Jing Yi Wang in circumstances amounting to manslaughter. 
       
       
      2. On 24 April 2004 at Rockdale in the State of New South Wales, she did possess a pistol, namely, a .25 calibre Raven self-loading pistol, not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. 
       
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty in relation to the firearm offence is 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 A statement of agreed facts was tendered. It provides that Ms Jing Yi Wang, described as the victim, who was born in 1978, was the cousin of the offender. At the time of the manslaughter they were both students at the University of New South Wales, and had lived together for approximately twelve months in a rented two bedroom home unit at 9/19-21A Keats Avenue, Rockdale. The offender and the victim were sharing one bedroom. 
     
      
    4 Yu Wang, who was a cousin of the offender, also lived in the unit along with another person named Fei Wang. Yu Wang and Fei Wang were sharing the second bedroom. 
     
      
    5 Yu Wang gave evidence at the committal proceedings. The statement of Yu Wang dated 25 April 2004 was also read onto the record at the committal. At page 5-6 of the committal transcript of evidence of Yu Wang, it is recorded that when Yu Wang: 
     
      
       
        
        “.. first came to Australia the offender and Jing Yee, a name by which the victim was known, appeared good friends .... Over time, while staying at the unit I began to think that Yini and Jing were in a relationship together ... My thinking was right when I saw Yini kiss Jing Yee ... I wanted to ask them about it but I didn’t because I didn’t want to be embarrassed if they weren’t girlfriends.” 
        
       
      
    6 At the committal Yu Wang said further: 
     
      
       
        
        “About one week before I moved out of the unit at Rockdale I noticed that there was no longer just one bed in Yini and Jing Yee’s bedroom. The two mattresses they slept on had separated. It looked like they slept on different mattresses.” 
        
       
      
    7 In March 2004, Yu Wang moved out of the unit at Rockdale. After this event, Yu Wang visited the unit of the offender on one occasion only and on this occasion socialised with Fei Wang, the offender and Jing Yee Wang. Yu Wang continued to have contact via the telephone with both the offender and Jing Yee Wang up until a couple of days before the shooting. Yu Wang recalled at the committal that he had made arrangements with the two to go to Sydney Airport on 25 April 2004 to meet the mother of the offender. Yu Wang said that when he: 
     
      
       
        
        “spoke to Jing Yee (Wang) on the phone she didn’t sound upset at all. She seemed happy and was playing poker on the Internet with Yini. She didn’t seem scared or worried at all about Yini. Later in the same phone conversation I also spoke to Yini. We spoke about Fa’s [Wang] study and how it was going. Yini didn’t seem upset or depressed at all about her or think that she was going to do something.” 
        
       
      
    8 Yu Wang said he terminated the phone call as Jing Yee Wang told him: 
     
      
       
        
        “…that they wanted to concentrate on the computer card game they were playing. That’s the last time I spoke with either Jing Yee [Wang] or Yini.” 
        
       
      
    9 During the evening of Friday 23 April 2004 the offender and the victim were at home together. At 23:56 on 23 April 2004 the offender used her mobile phone and made an international call to her aunt, Zeng Xiao Rong in Tokyo, Japan. Zeng Xiao Rong has provided a statement in relation to this matter and, at page 2, she states she had received a call from her brother’s daughter, the offender. The offender told her aunt “Wang Jing Yi is dead”. Zeng Xiao Rong stated that the offender sounded frightened. Zeng Xiao Rong asked the offender how Wang Jing Yi had died, and states the offender said, “I killed her. I shot her with a gun”. 
     
      
    10 Zeng Xiao Rong further states that she was shocked, and when she asked the offender how she got the gun, the offender replied, “I bought it”. Zeng Xiao Rong further stated that the offender had informed her: “I’ll go to the toilet, get changed, and then call the police”. 
     
      
    11 Approximately 25 minutes after the call to Zeng Xiao Rong, the offender used her mobile phone and made a phone call to the “OOO” emergency number. The transcript of that call is reproduced in its entirety in the agreed statement of facts. It contains clear verbatim admissions made by the offender to the telephone operator. However, there are only three sections of that transcript which it is necessary for me to repeat this morning. 
     
      
    12 During the course of the transcript the person taking the phone call, identified as VKG, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “VKG: What’s the matter ma’am? 
         
        OFFENDER: I kill my cousin. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: You what, sorry? 
         
        OFFENDER: I kill my cousin just now. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: You’ve killed your cousin? 
         
        OFFENDER: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: Okay, what do you mean you killed your cousin? 
         
        OFFENDER: She’s died now. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: She’s dead is she? 
         
        OFFENDER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: How did she die? 
         
        OFFENDER: I kill him, I kill her. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: How? 
         
        OFFENDER: By gun. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: By gun? 
         
        OFFENDER: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: Okay, and why did you do this, Yini? 
         
        OFFENDER: Because I love her and she love me but she doesn’t love me any more. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: And it’s your cousin, is it? 
         
        OFFENDER: Yeah, she is, I don’t know what I’m doing. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: Okay, is she bleeding a lot, whereabouts did you shoot her? 
         
        OFFENDER: Hey? 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: Whereabouts did you shoot her? 
         
        OFFENDER: In bed. 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: Yeah, whereabouts on her body? 
         
        OFFENDER: Head 
        
       
       
        
        VKG: In the head you shot her? 
         
        OFFENDER: Yeah. 
        
       
      
    13 As a result of the “OOO” call, police attended the home unit at Rockdale. The offender was observed to be talking on a mobile phone outside the front of the unit block when the police arrived. While on the footpath, the offender was spoken to by Inspector Peter Mitropoulos. At paragraph 5 of his statement, Inspector Mitropoulos notes the following conversation as having taken place: 
     
      
       
        
        “I approached the offender and said to Senior Constable Baroutis: ‘Is that the offender?’. Baroutis said, ‘Yes’. I said to the offender, ‘Did you shoot somebody?’ The offender said, ‘Yes, I shot my cousin in the head’.” 
        
       
      
    14 The offender was arrested and cautioned. The police then entered the offender’s unit where they found the victim deceased on a bed. She had been shot once in the throat and once in the forehead. A .25 calibre Raven self-loading pistol was on the other bed in the bedroom. 
     
      
    15 Ambulance personnel attended the unit and vital signs were checked, giving a negative result. A crime scene was established. 
     
      
    16 The offender was taken to Hurstville Police Station and custody requirements were attended to. A Chinese (Mandarin) language interpreter attended the station and the offender spoke on the telephone with a solicitor. The offender participated in an electronically recorded interview with the assistance of the interpreter. The offender did not deny shooting her cousin during the interview. When asked why she made a phone call to “OOO”, the offender replied that she wanted to “confess to the police”. The offender admitted making the phone calls to “OOO” and her aunt in Tokyo. However, when questioned on specifics in relation to the gun and the victim, the offender replied, “No comment”. 
     
      
    17 When questioned in relation to admissions she made to police at the scene, the offender said she could not remember what she had said. The offender was then charged. 
     
      
    18 Apart from the admissions made by the offender at the scene, and that recorded via her “OOO” telephone call, the offender’s fingerprints and DNA were present on the firearm found in the bedroom. Ballistic and gunshot residue evidence established that the firearm found in this bedroom was used to discharge the bullets that caused the death of the deceased. This was confirmed by the Coroner’s report attributing gunshot wounds to the head and neck as the direct cause of death. Gunshot primer residue consistent with the fired cartridge case recovered in the bathroom of the unit was also located on the body and clothing of the offender. 
     
      
    19 Jiahui Wang, the mother of the offender, made a statement on 30 April 2004 that goes to reveal the state of mind of the offender. Wang stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yini’s most recent trip home to China was over the Chinese New Year Period .... During her holiday she seemed very confined and did not want to see or speak with people… I could sense that there may be another problems [sic] so I asked Yini if she was experiencing any other personal problems. Yini told me that she was not … To my knowledge Yini was not involved in an intimate relationship with any person… I was not aware that Yini and Jing Yi Wang shared a bed .... I don’t believe that Yini and Jing Yi had a lesbian relationship. Yini has never experienced any mental health problems. Prior to her most recent trip home to China I have never known Yini to be depressed, she has never had any psychotic episodes ... Yini has never been prone to violence, nor has she ever shown any interest in firearms or weapons. I was not aware that Yini had access to a firearm .... I sent my daughter to Australia for her to be educated; I never imagined that this would happen ... I went to the Gaol [sic] earlier today and saw Yini. I asked Yini if she had been mistreated by anyone inside the gaol. Yini told me that she had not been mistreated or injured. I said to Yini, ‘You have destroyed many families by what you have done.’ Yini did not reply she began crying.” 
        
       
      
    20 Based on the cross-examination of the witnesses at the committal, it was apparent that the mental state of the offender at the time of the shooting of the victim would be relevant. As a result, the Crown commissioned a psychiatric report from Dr Rosalie Wilcox. The legal representatives of Ms Zeng had their client examined by a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, to whose report Dr Wilcox had access. Both these forensic psychiatrists concluded that Ms Zeng suffered from a major depressive illness and was depressed at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    21 In a follow up opinion, Dr Olav Nielssen stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Justice Health records show that Ms Zeng was placed in an observation cell in the period after her arrest and had frequent reviews by “RIT” (risk intervention teams) to assess the risk of suicide. It was noted on her reception that she attempted suicide three years earlier by cutting her wrists.” 
        
       
      
    22 In his follow-up report, Dr Nielssen also reproduced the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Zeng was assessed by a psychiatrist, Dr Giuffrida, ten days after her reception to gaol. Dr Giuffrida wrote ‘impression is that this lady is either dissociating or is psychotic as she is withdrawn and appears to be hallucinating.” 
        
       
      
    23 Ms Zeng was seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Lisa Brown, at regular intervals. Dr Brown prescribed a low dose of an antipsychotic medication and wrote, “I suspect she was psychotic around the time of the offence but it resolved”. However, Ms Zeng refused to take the medication prescribed and subsequent reviews found no evidence of mental illness. Dr Nielssen also stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The records show that Ms Zeng has received regular counselling and support whilst in custody and that her depressive illness has at least partially resolved without treatment and with antidepressant medication. Ms Zeng has been able to work within the gaol and has been able to resume university studies.” 
        
       
      
    24 The offender has not given evidence before me and, on no occasion, has she been able to explain the circumstances in which the shooting occurred. 
     
      
    25 The victim, Jing Yi Wang, was found lying on her back in her bed, clothed in her pyjamas with bullet wounds to her neck and head. There was no indication of any struggle or altercation. Although it is possible that the victim was shot while she was asleep, the evidence does not enable this finding to be made. The precise circumstances of the shooting remain unexplained. However, I am relevantly satisfied that it occurred when the offender was suffering a major depressive illness, and after she had been made aware that the victim was going to cease living with her. 
     
      
    26 The offender was originally charged with murder and a committal hearing took place. Following that hearing, the Crown accepted a plea of manslaughter.  
     
      
    27 Although the offender has not herself given evidence, I have received evidence from her mother, Jia Hui Yu Wang. She indicates that the offender is an only child who had a happy upbringing and did well at school. She has won many awards in China and was a student performing at the top of her class. 
     
      
    28 From an early age, the offender has had a close relationship with the victim and they spent every weekend together at their grandparents’ house and maintained a close relationship. 
     
      
    29 In her early years and during high school the offender was happy. She was compassionate towards others. 
     
      
    30 The offender returned to China from Australia in late 2003, when her mother found her to be a changed person. She had lost a lot of weight. She appeared confused and did not know what she was talking about. She expressed sorrow at her failures in her studies and her mother says that she looked depressed. 
     
      
    31 It is now apparent that, by that time, the offender was suffering the depressive illness, which affected her mind at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    32 In April 2004 the offender’s mother decided to pay a visit to her in Australia. She was concerned that her daughter was failing at the university and may need help. On one occasion the victim had said to the offender’s mother, “I think you should be here. I don’t think Yini is normal”. 
     
      
    33 Evidence was also given by Margaret Jennings, who is a Catholic religious sister and a member of the congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. She has met with the offender on a number of occasions and assisted with her spiritual development. She first met the offender in June 2005, and they have since met on eight occasions. 
     
      
    34 The offender has told Sister Jennings about her life in Australia and how she was initially doing well in her studies. She has told Sister Jennings that at some point her life seemed to suddenly change and was in “a total mess”. Although the offender tried hard, she continued to fail and began to believe that nobody cared about her. She felt ashamed and could not face her parents or other people. 
     
      
    35 She came to experience strong negative feelings about herself. Sister Jennings in her affidavit describes the offender’s account of the relevant events in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “At this time she was living with her cousin, and something happened that she cannot remember or understand. Yini Zing said that she saw her cousin dead, with blood all around. She called here aunty, and then the police, who came and took her to jail. She didn’t know what had happened and felt totally lost. This early time in jail; alone; she said that she felt quiet, as if she had no connection with the outside world. She kept to herself and couldn’t understand how it all had happened. I remember that Yini said, ‘I couldn’t believe that I would do something like this. I wondered what would become of my life and I felt that I would like to end it all.’ She also told me of how her Mother wrote and tried to support her. She realised that she had and still was causing great pain to her parents, and if she killed herself they would suffer even more.” 
        
       
      
    36 Sister Jennings described the recent development of the offender in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yini Zing told me that now she feels that she must come to accept what has happened and to learn from it and to live in such a way that she can make sure that it never happens again. Through help, she says that she has come to a point where she now wants to live a good and positive, outgoing helpful life. 
        
       
       
        
        Over the past months, Yini has grown more mature and has chosen to face what has happened. She realises that she cannot change what has happened and she cannot do much about it while she is in custody. She knows that she cannot help the victim, but when she goes home she hopes to be able to help the victim’s family in some way. Several times she has expressed that she is really very sorry for what has happened. She is sorry for the victim, for the suffering and pain she has caused the victim’s family and her own family.” 
        
       
      
    37 The Sister says: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have been with Yini over the past months, I have sensed a change in her. Having faced what she believes has happened, she has grown stronger within herself. She has also learnt about God in her life. This happened first of all from her room mate, and later from our spiritual direction sessions. It appears to me that as she has come to see the forgiving, understanding love of God towards herself, she has been drawn to be ready to forgive herself. This has given her a sense of inner freedom. Such a relationship with God, usually leads one to a sense of the need to repair relationships with others or to be ready to relate well to others. I see that this has happened and continues to grow within Yini as I have expressed above. As we meet, she has spoken to me about all these aspects of change that are taking place in her life. 
        
       
       
        
        Since Yini has been in Mulawa, from what she has said to me, and through discussion with a couple of staff I have come to believe that she is co-operative, a peaceful kind of person, considerate of others. She works as a clerk, using the computer. She has talked about how she is happy to do this. She believes that she is trusted by those under whom she works and she tries to be responsible. She is happy, does her best and desires and tries to co-operate with the staff and to show respect to all. She speaks about how she has come to realise that she must face what has happened in her life and whether she succeeds or not is not as important as it seemed to be to her before she came to jail. Far more important is how she lives with either failure or success, by facing reality. 
        
       
       
        
        As Yini shares about these changes in her life, I can see that they are happening. She has a strong conviction that if she ever should feel ‘depressed’ like she did before, she must seek help and not let herself do something that she would later regret. She believes that she has both the maturity, understanding and horror about what she has done, that she will make sure that it doesn’t happen again.” 
        
       
      
    38 The Crown does not challenge Sister Jennings’ evidence. I accept that the offender is remorseful and regrets her actions. It is most unlikely that she would re-offend, although she may need future treatment should she suffer a recurrence of her depressive illness. 
     
      
    39 When sentencing an offender in respect of whom criminal responsibility is diminished, having regard to section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) it is necessary to determine the objective gravity of the offence. Of relevance to that matter is, firstly, the degree of substantial impairment that affected the offender’s responsibility for the acts of causing the death; and, secondly, the nature of the abnormality of the mind. 
     
      
    40 Dr Olav Nielssen, the psychiatrist, has seen the offender on a number of occasions. On the occasion of the interview of 19 April 2005 he records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Zeng’s command of English had improved since the initial assessment and she appeared more at ease in the prison setting. She said that she was studying business management. She had gained some weight and appeared better groomed. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Zeng said that the crisis that led to her purchasing the gun and then killing her cousin began with her belief that she would fail her exams. She said that she was under great pressure to pass because if she did not graduate within the allotted time she would not qualify for skilled migrant status. She said that she lost confidence in her ability to pass and became increasingly depressed. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Zeng said that she was conscious of being depressed during a visit to China during the university holiday. She said that she brought sleeping tablets from China with the though that she might take an overdose of the tablets. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Zeng said that she bought the gun with the intention of killing herself and had never considered using it for any other purpose. She reported frequent ruminations of suicide in the two months before the offence. She said that she had never thought of killing her cousin ‘until it happened.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Zeng said that she had asked herself many times but still did not know why she killed her cousin. She said ‘I hate myself for it.’ She confirmed that she was not affected by alcohol, drugs or any form of medication, although she said that she had recently taken medication to help her sleep. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Zeng said that she had never believed that her cousin wanted to die or that she deserved to die. She again denied that she felt angry towards her over being rejected, as suggested by the initial statements.” 
        
       
      
    41 Dr Nielssen diagnosed Ms Zeng as having a major depressive illness at the time of the offence. The doctors says, of the effect of that illness: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion Ms Zeng was suffering from an abnormality of mind arising from her depressive illness at the time of the offence. Major depression is an underlying condition within the meaning of section 23A of the Crimes Act. Depression affected Ms Zeng’s perception of the events, in that she interpreted her situation to be worse than it really was, and her capacity to judge right from wrong because of her bleak view of her own prospects, which included the belief that committing suicide was a reasonable course of action to take. I believe the presence of major depression also affected her capacity to control her actions because the tendency to act on impulse in a destructive way, without considering the likely consequences that often accompanies severe depression.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown psychiatrist, Dr Rosalie Wilcox, also diagnosed Ms Zeng as having a major illness at the time of the offence, with possibly a psychotic component involving auditory hallucinations. Dr Giuffrida and Dr Lisa Brown both hold the opinion that the offender showed signs of psychosis. However, whether those symptoms were because of the trauma associated with the killing, or formed part of the pre-existing mental illness of the offender, I cannot determine. 
     
      
    43 I have given careful consideration to all of the medical evidence and have concluded, that at the time of the offence, the offender was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from her depressive illness. The offender’s impairment should be considered to be in the middle range and affected her capacity to understand events and control her actions. 
     
      
    44 Because of the fact that there is no evidence of the sequence of events which immediately preceded the shooting, other aspects of the objective gravity of the offence are difficult to determine. However, I am satisfied that the killing was not planned, and was impulsive. Although the offender had a gun, I am satisfied that this had been purchased in contemplation of taking her own life and that she had never planned on killing her cousin. 
     
      
    45 The fact that the gun was available had the consequence that, in her diminished state of responsibility, the offender reacted to her personal circumstances and the prospect of losing the company of her cousin by shooting her. 
     
      
    46 It is impossible not to reflect upon the fact that if the offender had not been able to purchase the gun, for which she did not hold a licence, this terrible tragedy would not have happened. The case reflects again the fact that the ready availability of firearms is the source of many tragedies in our community. It is a stark reminder of the need to confine the availability of weapons and for vigilance in controlling their illegal importation and distribution. 
     
      
    47 The offender has a strong subjective case. She entered the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, the Crown having originally charged her with murder. She is entitled to the maximum discount for her plea. She has a previously unblemished record, and this offence is entirely out of character. Notwithstanding the offences, she retains the support of her family. 
     
      
    48 As I have already indicated, the offender has shown remorse and, I have no doubt, is extremely sorry for taking her cousin’s life and inflicting immeasurable sorrow and unhappiness upon her cousin’s family and her own parents. 
     
      
    49 She has provided assistance to the authorities, although, in the circumstances of this case, this factor carries little weight. The offence was not difficult to detect. 
     
      
    50 Being a Chinese national, with language difficulties, her incarceration will be more difficult and there is less opportunity for her to receive visits from her family. 
     
      
    51 It was submitted that I should also have regard to the fact that, upon her release from custody in Australia, the offender will be deported and may be subject to extra curial punishment in China. Evidence was tendered of some of the elements of the relevant Chinese criminal law, which suggests that a Chinese citizen who commits an offence overseas may, notwithstanding that they have received punishment in the country in which the offence was committed, be further punished upon their return to China. 
     
      
    52 The question arises as to whether or not, when sentencing an offender in Australia, any regard should be had to the prospect of punishment in accordance with Chinese law. However, such a question could only arise if it was possible to form the view that further punishment would be inevitable or likely. The evidence in the present case does not support either conclusion and, accordingly, I do not believe it appropriate to have regard to those matters. 
     
      
    53 On every occasion on which a court is required to sentence an offender for manslaughter, by reason of a substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, as provided by s 23A of the Crimes Act, the sentencing judges have commented upon the difficulty of the task. By reason of the extraordinary range of factual circumstances in which manslaughter occurs, sentencing offenders for manslaughter is itself difficult. The task is more difficult when, as in the present case, the actions of the offender are deliberate and, but for the fact or the existence of the relevant impairment, the appropriate charge would have been murder. 
     
      
    54 A number of previous decisions have been identified by counsel for the offender, which variously described the circumstances in which sentences have been imposed for manslaughter by reason of the matters referred to in s 23A. However, reference to these decisions does not lead to any comfortable conclusions that there is an accepted range of penalty. 
     
      
    55 In R v Low (1991) 57 A Crim R 8, Lee CJ at CL said at 19: 
     
      
       
        
        “A finding of diminished responsibility may occur in many many circumstances, excessive alcoholism causing brain damage, injury to the brain, mental condition arising in various ways and giving rise to delusions and the like, but such conditions do not deny the legal responsibility of the person concerned for criminal acts and the legislation has required that such a killing shall be seen as an unlawful homicide. The taking of life in circumstances other than in self defence or by accident, is regarded in our community as a grave crime and notwithstanding the concession that a lesser crime than murder is committed when there is diminished responsibility under section 23A, it is wrong to approach the matter on the footing that the killer, in such circumstances, is necessarily to be treated as if he lacked any capacity to control his will so as to refrain from causing the death of his victim.” 
        
       
      
    56 His Honour repeated what was said by Sir Laurence Street in R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the 
          
        Crimes Act 1900 
         and in the community at large, as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attendant by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of reports and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party.” 
        
       
      
    57 Having regard to the various objective and subjective matters to which I have referred, I am satisfied that a non-parole period of four and a half years should be imposed. 
     
      
    58 The offender will need a significant period of supervision following her return to the community and, accordingly, I find special circumstances. In my opinion, the appropriate additional term is a period of three years and six months, making a total sentence of eight years. 
     
      
    59 With respect to the firearm matter, I am satisfied that the offender acquired the gun against the possibility of killing herself, and had not contemplated taking her cousin’s life. However, as I have said, the offence is serious and a sentence reflecting in particular the need to deter others from committing a similar offence, should be imposed. In my opinion, the appropriate sentence is a term of imprisonment of eighteen months. However, having regard to the interrelationship of that offence with the manslaughter charge, the lesser sentence should be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
     
      
    60 Ms Yini Zeng, please stand. You have pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter and the possession of a pistol not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. I have heard and taken into account all of the matters that have been put by counsel on your behalf. I have had regard to the circumstances in which the offences occurred, your pleas of guilty and your personal circumstances. 
     
      
    61 You are convicted of manslaughter. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of eight years, having first set a non-parole period of four and a half years. I have found special circumstances and the balance of the term of your sentence is three years and six months. The sentence is to date from 24 April 2004 and the earliest date upon which you will become eligible for release on parole is 23 October 2008. 
     
      
    62 In relation to the second matter, you are convicted of possessing a pistol not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. On that charge I sentence you to a fixed term of eighteen months full time imprisonment, to commence on 24 April 2004 and expire on 23 October 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted after a jury trial of maliciously wounding Sharon Bavistock with intent to do her grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of four years and six months. 
     
      
    2 The issues at the trial were the identity of the person who inflicted the injuries on the victim and, if that person was the appellant, whether he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    3 Ms Bavistock gave evidence at the trial. She said that she had returned to her car which was parked in Erina Street, Gosford after dropping her mother at the local medical centre. When she looked to the right from her car across the roadway she saw a red Ford motor car facing up the road. She said that the man in the driver’s seat appeared to be familiar – she thought that she may have been at Wyong High School with him. She said that the man smiled at her and she waved a “hello” before getting into her car. 
     
      
    4 Ms Bavistock remarked to her son, who was a passenger in her car, that she thought she recognised the man as someone she had been to high school with more than twenty years ago. 
     
      
    5 Ms Bavistock then drove to the underground car park of the Imperial Centre at Erina. After she had retrieved her ticket from the dispenser she recognised the car behind her as the same Ford she had seen in Erina Street. She parked her car and the Ford motorcar parked in the space next to her. Ms Bavistock said that her son who was sitting in the front passenger seat had his window down. She looked over past him and said to the driver of the red Ford, who also had his window down, “Oh hi, is your name John. Didn’t I go to Wyong High School with you?” The complainant said that the man replied, “Isn’t your name Sharon?” to which she said “Yes”. The complainant then said “Oh is it John?” and he went sort of “Yeah”. While both parties were still seated in their cars, Ms Bavistock continued the conversation, “Oh right, I’m pretty sure I went to school with you down at Wyong High School. Oh, this is my son Shane.” 
     
      
    6 Ms Bavistock noticed that there was a woman in the passenger seat of the red Ford along with some children in the back seat. She said that she did not recognise the woman and had never seen her before. That woman was Ms Marie Innes. 
     
      
    7 Ms Bavistock got out of her car and stood between it and the car door. She noticed Ms Innes get out of the red Ford. Ms Bavistock introduced herself, “Hi, I’m Sharon, everyone calls me Shaz. I went to school with your husband. This is my son Shane”. She then put her head back into the car and told her son that they should be going. 
     
      
    8 Ms Bavistock said that she had assumed that the woman in the passenger seat of the red Ford motor car was going to attend to her children in the back seat. However, as she was about to lock her car she said that “the girl’s just come out of nowhere and just king hit me right on the crown, right on the temple.” 
     
      
    9 Ms Bavistock’s next memory was of being held and comforted by an elderly lady, having blood everywhere and her son grabbing a towel for her to hold her head.  
     
      
    10 Ms Bavistock confirmed in cross examination that she did not see the man who was the driver of the red Ford get out of his car. She denied that she knew Ms Innes as “Marie” or that Marie spoke to her and said, “You should remember me, you raped me, didn’t you? I’m going to have you charged, bitch”. She denied responding with the words “Yeah that’s right, cunt, I’ll do it again”. 
     
      
    11 It was suggested to Ms Bavistock in cross-examination that there was a fight in the car park between her and Marie after Marie had said, “I’m pregnant”. She denied that Marie spoke to her or that there was a fight. Ms Bavistock also denied commencing any fight. When asked if her son called out, “Get her Mum” Ms Bavistock said that he did not. During cross-examination Ms Bavistock said she realised later that she was mistaken in thinking that she recognised the driver of the red Ford. 
     
      
    12 There were a number of witnesses to the incident. The complainant’s son, Shane Martinez, said that while he was still seated in the car and after his mother had closed her door the woman from the red Ford went around and hit Ms Bavistock. He saw a punch then his mother fall onto the car next to them. He said the woman from the red Ford kicked his mother while she was on the ground. He gave evidence that he never saw anything in the woman’s hand at any stage.  
     
      
    13 Mr Martinez said that the appellant then got out of the driver’s side of the red Ford and walked around the back of the car and starting hitting his mother with a car security lock, called a “club lock.” He said that he first saw the club lock when the appellant started swinging the lock above his head and bringing it down to the ground. He said that the appellant hit his mother about six times or possibly more. 
     
      
    14 When Mr Martinez challenged the appellant he raised the club lock and said “stay out of it.” 
     
      
    15 Although Mr Martinez tried to intervene, before he could do so security guards or possibly police officers arrived. 
     
      
    16 Geoffrey Moher gave evidence. He was in the car park with a friend, Mr Russell Hammond, intending to go shopping when he saw the scuffle between the two women. This was followed by his observations of a man, who Mr Moher thought may have come to the aid of his wife, who “all of a sudden he picked up the club lock and he drove it, he’s standing over her and he drove it in a downward motion and he knocked, whacked into her face, yeah. He drove the club lock down into her face.” 
     
      
    17 He demonstrated the man holding the club lock in both hands, pushing downwards. He said there was one powerful hit and then the appellant made a couple of other jabs, but was not sure if they connected as well as the first one. Mr Moher said that Mr Hammond said, “What are you doing?” or words to that effect, when the man told them “She rapes woman … she rapes girls, she arranges for girls to be raped.” 
     
      
    18 When cross examined Mr Moher’s recollection was challenged and it was suggested he may have mistakenly thought the appellant used the lock instead of Ms Innes. Mr Moher was emphatic in rejecting this suggestion stating that Ms Innes had moved away when he saw the appellant strike the victim. 
     
      
    19 Evidence was also given by Mr Hammond. He said he saw two women in an altercation and then observed a person who “had a piece of blue metal, looked like a crook lock, and he brought it down where the woman was lying on the ground.” 
     
      
    20 Asked what he observed he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Him raise the crook lock and bring it down on the lady that was on the ground.” 
        
       
      
    21 He indicated that he did not actually see the car lock connect with the woman his vision being obscured by a pillar and the parked cars. 
     
      
    22 Each of Mr Martinez and Mr Moher gave evidence that they did not see the appellant remove the steering lock from the hands of either Ms Innes or the victim. All three of them, Mr Martinez, Mr Moher and Mr Hammond said that the steering lock was not in the hands of Ms Innes. 
     
      
    23 Ms Gail Ransley gave evidence that while she was looking for a car parking space she observed a woman bending over and hitting something on the ground. She also saw a man standing behind the woman watching what she was doing. She observed that when the woman stopped hitting the person on the ground the man continued to do so. She could not see anything in his hands - all she could see were his arms; although she could not say that he was not holding anything. 
     
      
    24 Snr Constable Gautier attended the car park on a bicycle. He observed the complainant and others in the car park screaming “it’s him, it’s him.” He said that he approached the appellant and told him “Just be cool man” and the appellant replied “It was me.” He also gave evidence that the appellant had responded to the complainant’s son by saying “Your Mum’s a rapist, your mum rapes blokes, she’s a rapist.” 
     
      
    25 Const Gautier also gave evidence that the appellant said “I promise I won’t run away, I can’t, my back’s fucked” and the appellant also told him: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mate this slut she rapes blokes, she gets blokes to rape other blokes, she makes them smell stuff that knocks them out and then she gets another bloke to rape them, it’s potassium something or other.” 
        
       
      
    26 Snr Const Gautier says that when he questioned the appellant about what happened the appellant replied in the following way:  
     
      
       
        
        “I smacked her mate, she gets blokes raped, she got this blond friend from up north, Cessnock or something and she’s good looking and they get blokes to come around because they’re nice looking and she will get the blokes and say something like ‘smell this’ and when he does it makes him pass out. Once this bloke’s, with the rush, he went through a bloke who is not into this, you know, and then he got the rush too. It is not right you know when the bloke is not into this kind of stuff.” 
        
       
      
    27 Evidence was also given by Const Hancock who took over custody of the appellant from Snr Const Gautier. He gave evidence that he had a conversation with the appellant during which the appellant said “I should have fucking killed her, I should have fucking killed her.” He gave evidence that the appellant said similar things to Ms Innes. 
     
      
    28 Ms Innes was taken from the scene, cautioned and conveyed to the Gosford police station. She declined to provide a witness statement or be interviewed. Det Snr Const Driscoll said that Ms Innes was not formally charged, as there was insufficient evidence to substantiate charging her with anything other than common assault, which did not reflect the magnitude of the assault which occurred. I have some concerns as to whether this view was appropriate but the issue is not of present relevance. 
     
      
    29 Ms Bavistock suffered severe injuries. Her lips were split and her teeth damaged. She bled profusely from the mouth. Although she remained conscious she was very upset. She had fractures to her cheek bone and severe bruising. The complainant described her injuries as being that the whole left side of her face was “totally smashed in.” 
     
      
       
      The evidence of the appellant 
       
      
    30 The appellant gave evidence. His version of the events was that when the cars pulled up beside each other he engaged in light hearted conversation with Ms Bavistock. He noticed that Ms Innes had got out of their car and had moved towards Ms Bavistock who had left her vehicle. He said “Sharon (Ms Bavistock) had stood up outside her vehicle. She then looked at Marie (Ms Innes) and “sort of smiled” and said that she, “Oh, I know him from school.” Marie said “Do you remember me?” and Sharon said “Why?” Marie said “You should fucking remember me, cunt, you raped me” and Sharon answered with “Yes, that’s right and I’m going to do it again” and Marie said at that stage that she is going to have her charged and Sharon immediately struck Marie in the head.” 
     
      
    31 The appellant indicated that the blow was made with a closed fist but he “had noticed at this stage that Marie was holding the blue club lock which has been entered in evidence.” 
     
      
    32 The appellant said that he ordered Mr Martinez to tell his mother to stop because Ms Innes was pregnant. He then says he approached the two women and as he was pulling Ms Bavistock away by the hair “I proceeded to pull her back and at this time she started to fall and I stepped back, like I stepped back to clear myself sort of from her. At this time I heard a considerably large whack noise, a loud thumping noise.” 
     
      
    33 He was asked whether he saw anything that caused the whack noise to which he replied “Not when I heard the noise but when Sharon has fallen back the club lock was situated in her mouth.” 
     
      
    34 Although the appellant said Ms Bavistock struck the first blow Ms Innes suffered only a superficial injury. The evidence of the appellant was that “there was a small like a scratch or something.” It was not bleeding. 
     
      
    35 On the appellant’s version Ms Innes must have exited from her vehicle with the lock in her hand and moved towards the victim. Inherent in his account is the assumption that Ms Innes did not intend violence towards the victim and it was the victim who threw the first punch.  
     
      
    36 The appellant’s version of the events is that he did not see Ms Innes actually deliver the blow with the lock all he heard was the thud. He said all this occurred at a time when he was pulling Ms Bavistock away from Ms Innes by the hair. He heard a whack and she ended up on the floor. Although the victim was approximately two metres tall the appellant said he jumped back out of the way and let her fall to the ground. 
     
      
    37 The appellant was cross examined about his admissions to Const Gautier. He said of each of them that the policeman had lied and he did not say the words attributed to him. 
     
      
    38 After his arrest the appellant was passed to the custody of Const Hancock and the evidence was that the appellant said to him “I should have fucking killed her. I should have fucking killed her.” 
     
      
    39 The appellant denied saying this and says he said to his wife “I could have killed her” but “I’d said how they’re fucking idiots because she come up to say that like you know, that she done it and it wasn’t me and I told her to shut up. I said they’re fucking – like they’re fucking idiots I could have killed her. Like I could have killed her if I’d done it and I turned to her and I said that. I never said it – to – anything of the sort to him.” 
     
      
    40 The appellant repeated his assertion that the constable had misheard him. 
     
      
    41 The jury may well have found the appellant’s denial of the use of the word “should” in the circumstances difficult to accept. If, as he said his only intervention in proceedings was to remove Ms Bavistock from the altercation with Ms Innes it is difficult to understand why he should be speaking of killing Ms Bavistock at all. Furthermore, unless it was he who had delivered the blow with the lock it is difficult to understand the assertion that he could have killed her. To my mind, the account which the appellant gives of the conversation which he had with Const Hancock and his wife cannot be accepted. 
     
      
    42 When cross examined the appellant agreed that all of the people around him were pointing to him and yelling out “It’s him, it’s him”. He denied that he told the police “it was me.” The appellant asserted in cross-examination that the police officers had lied, were corrupt and had tampered with the witnesses’ evidence. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Ms Innes 
       
      
    43 Ms Innes was also called to give evidence in the appellant’s case. It is her evidence which gives rise to this appeal. She said that when they pulled up next to Ms Bavistock’s car in the car park she recognised her as a woman she had previously met around October 2001. Ms Innes described meeting Ms Bavistock after reading an advertisement that had been placed in the newspaper. Ms Innes called her to see if she could get some escort work. Ms Innes said that Ms Bavistock said she could, and to come over and meet her, which Ms Innes did.  
     
      
    44 Ms Innes gave evidence that after the appellant turned around to speak to Ms Bavistock in the underground car park, she got out of the car with the blue club lock, which had between the seat and the console in the car, walked around the back of both parked cars and by the time she got to Ms Bavistock’s side of the car, she had got out of her car. Ms Innes said that she took the club lock out of the car because she wanted to confront Ms Bavistock about raping her, that she was scared of her and she knew Ms Bavistock carried a gun. Ms Innes agreed in cross examination that she had not seen the complainant for 14 months and that she had not gone to the police during that time. 
     
      
    45 Ms Innes said that in the car park she had the following conversation with Ms Bavistock: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Innes: Do you remember me, you should, admit that you raped me. 
        
       
       
        
        Complainant: Yeah, what are going to do about it? 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Innes: Nothing, I’m pregnant, I just wanted you to admit that you done it in front of someone. Look I am going to have you charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Complainant: Yeah, I’ll do it again.” 
        
       
      
    46 Ms Innes said that Ms Bavistock then hit her on the side of the head with her fist. In cross examination Ms Innes said that the complainant called her by name, saying “Here Marie and I will do it again.” 
     
      
    47 Ms Innes gave evidence that Ms Bavistock tried to take the club lock off her and they wrestled over it for a few seconds. Ms Innes then pushed Ms Bavistock, who fell over and grabbed hold of Ms Innes’ shirt and was trying to knee and kick Ms Innes in the stomach. Ms Innes said that as Ms Bavistock let go of the club lock, she hit her with it. 
     
      
    48 Ms Innes said that she understood by giving this evidence she was leaving herself liable to be prosecuted. She described how she hit Ms Bavistock by bending over her, holding the club lock with both hands and then swung the club lock back about waist high towards her right hand side, behind her, slowly lifting it around to shoulder height, and then swung it forward and down towards the complainant’s face. Ms Innes then gave evidence that she looked up and saw the appellant standing there and that he took the club lock off the complainant’s face. The club lock had come out of her hands when she hit Ms Bavistock and one of the hooks of the club lock was hooked in the complainant’s mouth. 
     
      
    49 After the car lock had been freed from Ms Bavistock’s face the appellant and Ms Innes returned to their car and attempted to leave the car park. They said they were going to the police station to report the incident. They took this course notwithstanding the fact that the victim had been seriously wounded. The appellant said that he sought to leave the scene because they were concerned for their safety and feared that the victim or her son may have a gun. Given the injuries suffered by Ms Bavistock the jury may well have found this explanation for their behaviour difficult to accept. 
     
      
    50 Ms Innes also gave evidence as to why she did not tell the police officer what had happened. She said that the appellant told her not to say anything “he doesn’t want me getting into trouble while I’m pregnant.” She said that the appellant said to her as a police officer approached her “they think I did it, don’t tell them anything, if I done it I could have killed her and just be quiet I don’t want you getting into trouble while your pregnant.” 
     
      
    51 Ms Innes denied that the appellant had used the club lock or had hit Ms Bavistock. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    52 There are two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground One – the trial miscarried as a consequence of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination and address to the jury. 
       
       
      Ground Two – the trial miscarried as a consequence of his Honour’s directions to the jury in respect of the evidence of Ms Innes. 
       
       
      The cross examination 
       
      
    53 Ms Innes was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, inter alia, as to why she had not reported her version of the incident to the police earlier. In respect of the period when Ms Innes was first detained by the police the Crown Prosecutor asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Why didn’t you tell the police officer what had happened then? 
         
        A: Because Wayne told me not to say anything. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Didn’t you think this time would be pretty important when you are seeing your husband handcuffed for something according to you he didn’t do? 
         
        A: Well. I yeah, I believe that at the end of the day it would be sorted out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That’s February, this is November? 
         
        A: Yeah, I didn’t think it would take long. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You never from February to November went to the police station and told them this account did you? 
         
        A; No I never. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You have never rung the police up and said ‘Listen you have charged my man, he didn’t do it, I did it’? 
         
        A: On the day they were getting told, she rapes people and drugs them, she does and no attention at all was getting paid to it. “ 
        
       
      
    54 Later she was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. From February 2003 to 13 November 2003 have you at any time gone to the police and told them this version of events? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In fact on 17 February 2003 you were asked by Det Driscoll if you were prepared and wanted to make a statement, weren’t you? 
         
        A: Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You said ‘No’ 
         
        A: That’s right. At that point they had already blown off what had been said about her drugging people and raping them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You told Det Driscoll that you did not wish to give your account of what occurred on that day. 
         
        A: That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You have never … .” 
        
       
      
    55 At this point objection was taken but questioning continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: On this day you were arrested Ms Innes, on 17 February? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You were subsequently on the same day released? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You never had your clothes taken? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You knew when you walked out of the Gosford Police Station that you were not arrested? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You were not charged? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: At no time between then and now have you returned to that police station or called a police officer and said ‘Wayne didn’t do it, I did.’ 
         
        A: No I haven’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now from February, February to November of this year you have lived with the accused, Wayne? 
         
        A: Yes.” 
        
       
      
    56 This line of cross-examination continued and the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You’ve never practised what you’re (sic) are going to say in the witness box in a court of law? 
         
        A: I have gone through the statement that I made to the solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So you made a statement to the solicitor? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But you didn’t make a statement to the police? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
      
    57 It is submitted by the appellant that this cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor was not permissible being contrary to the decisions of the High Court in Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 and R v Glennon (1994) 179 CLR 1. It is submitted that the witness’s silence assumed considerable forensic importance in the case. In this respect the appellant points to the address of the Crown Prosecutor in which the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The police arrive. Again no reporting to a police officer by her and she let her husband get handcuffed, arrested, taken to Gosford Police Station, charged, brief of evidence being bought against him and ten months go by. Not a word on the day, not a word in between 17 February 2003 and yesterday. Not a word. Not a statement to police. In fact declined a statement to police. Not one time did she go to the police and ring and tell them: you’ve got it wrong man, I’m the one that did it. Please let my husband go.” 
        
       
      
    58 The Crown Prosecutor also emphasised the fact that Ms Innes declined an invitation during the course of official questioning to take part in an ERISP. It is submitted that the purpose or effect of the questions and submissions was to invite the jury to draw an inference against Ms Innes’ credibility on the basis that she failed to inform the police about her involvement in the assault, either at the time she and the appellant were arrested, or, at a later time.  
     
      
       
      The trial judge’s directions 
       
      
    59 It is submitted by the appellant that the sting of the prohibited inference was made worse by the trial judge’s summing up to the jury concerning Ms Innes’ evidence in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And the Crown points to the inconsistencies between the evidence of Marie Innes and the accused. She set that out in detail for you and I do not propose to elaborate upon that. Importantly, she says that the version given to you by the witness Ms Innes was only given for the first time yesterday. She had never reported the detail of her alleged actions to the police before yesterday. She had been given the opportunity to make a statement to the police before but she declined. 
        
       
       
        
        Now of course, I should remind you as with the accused, if this woman believed that she was involved in the offence which she clearly said she did yesterday, the police had already warned her that she need not say anything about that matter to them. That is a factor which you would want to bear in mind.” 
        
       
      
    60 The appellant submits that although his Honour invited the jury to weigh in the balance the warning against self incrimination which Ms Innes had been given by the arresting police the trial judge did not direct the jury, in accordance with established principle, that no adverse inference could be drawn against the witness from her silence and, furthermore, no inference adverse to the case for the accused could be drawn, as a consequence of the witness exercising her protection against self incrimination. 
     
      
    61 It is submitted that the jury ought not to have been left with any understanding that it could draw an unfavourable inference against the appellant from the exercise of Ms Innes’ right to silence on the night of her arrest and afterwards. 
     
      
       
      Section 89 of the Evidence Act 
       
      
    62 Apart from the problems which the appellant submits arise from the application of common law principles it is further submitted that both the cross-examination and the Crown address offended s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused:  
         
         
        (a) to answer one or more questions, or 
         
        (b) to respond to a representation, 
         
         put or made to the party or other person in the course of official questioning. 
         
         
        (2) Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
         
         
        (4) In this section:  
         
         
        inference 
         includes:  
         
         
        (a) an inference of consciousness of guilt, or 
         
        (b) an inference relevant to a party’s credibility.” 
        
       
      
    63 It is submitted that the effect of the section was that in this case the trial judge ought to have directed the jury that they were not to use Ms Innes’ exercise of her right to silence in any manner adverse to the appellant. Allowing the submission to be made to the jury that Ms Innes’ silence impugned her credit adversely affected the veracity of the appellant’s defence that the striking with the lock was not done by the appellant but by Ms Innes, and accordingly, was contrary to s 89. It is submitted that the effect of the misdirection in this case was that the jury was invited to reject the evidence of Ms Innes, and the sworn denial of the appellant that he had assaulted the victim with the club lock, on an impermissible basis, namely, that the details of the applicant’s defence had not been revealed to the investigating police. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 and the proviso – submission of the appellant 
       
      
    64 It is submitted by the appellant that there were material inconsistencies in the evidence of the eye witnesses which cast doubt on whether the appellant had committed the crime. These inconsistencies were pointed out by the trial judge when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I should also point out to you that the reliability of the identification of the accused as the person who hit the victim is in issue. A number of witnesses have identified the person who hit the victim as being a male. However, there are inconsistencies in their versions. Whilst it might be said that there is a general consistency between the versions given by the three men, that is Shane Martinez, Mr Moher and Mr Hammond, that is that it was a man who hit the victim with a blue implement, that evidence is not confirmed by the other independent witness, Ms Ransley. 
        
       
       
        
        All she could say was that the man was present and he may have had something in his hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Even between Mr Moher and Mr Hammond, there are inconsistencies, Mr Hammond indicated that he did not have clear view of the incident whereas Mr Moher said he did. Possibly that is explained by the fact that they were positioned differently. There was also a difference in the manner in which the three men said that the implement was used to strike the victim. There is also a difference between Mr Moher and the other witnesses as to where the actual incident took place. I will have some more to say about this when I come to outline the addresses of counsel. But because this is a crucial issue in the case, I warn you that the eyewitness accounts of seeing the accused hit the victim, with the blue implement might be unreliable and you should exercise care or caution before relying on those versions.” 
        
       
      
    65 Accordingly, it is submitted that having regard to the unreliability of the identifying accounts when taken together, the critical issue for the defence case was whether Ms Innes was to be believed. In these circumstances a direction which wrongly detracted from her credibility deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. 
     
      
    66 Accordingly, for these reasons, it is submitted that the trial miscarried and although leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal rules is required and s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 “the proviso” must be considered, it is submitted that a significant miscarriage has arisen and leave should be granted and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
       
      The position having regard to the common law 
       
      
    67 Because of the conclusion I have reached with respect to s 89 it is not necessary to resolve the common law position. However, some consideration of the relevant principles may be useful.  
     
      
    68 At common law a person who believes on reasonable grounds that he or she is suspected of being a party to an offence is entitled to remain silent: Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 at 99. Described by the High Court in Petty as a “fundamental right” the courts have been alert to confine forensic activity which might intrude upon or diminish the right. For this reason, in a criminal trial, it cannot be suggested that an accused’s exercise of the right to silence provides a basis for inferring a consciousness of guilt. Furthermore, it cannot be suggested that previous silence about a defence raised at the trial “provides a basis for inferring that the defence is a new invention or is rendered suspect or is unacceptable” Petty p 99. 
     
      
    69 In RPS (2000) 199 CLR 620 at 630 Kirby and Hayne JJ said of the “right to silence”: 
     
      
       
        
        “That expression is a useful shorthand description of a number of different rules that apply to the criminal law. (their Honours refer to the observation by Lord Mustill in  
        R v Director of Serious Fraud Office: Ex parte Smith  
        [1993] AC 1 at 30-31). But referring without more, to the ‘right to silence’ is not always a safe basis for reasoning in a particular case; the use of the expression ‘right to silence’ may obscure the particular rule or principle that is being applied.” 
        
       
      
    70 Lord Mustill described the “right to silence” as a group of disparate immunities. He identified six immunities although he did not suggest his list was exhaustive. The list is: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A general immunity,  
        possessed by all persons  
        and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions posed by other persons or bodies. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A general immunity,  
        possessed by all persons  
        and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate them. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A specific immunity,  
        possessed by all persons under suspicion of criminal responsibility whilst being interviewed by police officers  
        and others in similar positions 
          
        of authority, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions of any kind. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A specific immunity,  
        possessed by accused persons undergoing trial,  
        from being compelled to give evidence, and from being compelled to answer questions put to them in the dock. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) A specific immunity,  
        possessed by persons who have been charged with a criminal offence,  
        from having questions material to the offence addressed to them by police officers or persons in a similar position of authority. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) A specific immunity (at least in certain circumstances, which it is unnecessary to explore),  
        possessed by accused persons undergoing trial,  
        from having adverse comment made on any failure (a) to answer questions before the trial, or (b) to give evidence at the trial.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    71 In Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 McHugh J discussed the history of the various immunities. Rather than a principle developed by the common law from early times McHugh J identified that “the notion of a right to silence, in the modern sense, was the invention of lawyers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries” [147]. 
     
      
    72 His Honour expressed regret in joining with other members of the Court in Petty having, on reflection, come to the view that “we took the right to silence in the face of police questioning as a given and without citing authority.” However his Honour believed that it was too late to turn the clock back [169]. 
     
      
    73 It cannot be doubted following Petty and Azzopardi that a person who reasonably believes that he or she is a suspect may remain silent in the face of official questioning. It will be obvious that consistent with that immunity a person is under no obligation to confess to having committed a crime. The question is whether, should they confess to the crime at a later time and, more particularly, give evidence confessing to the crime, the veracity of that confession may be attacked because they availed themselves of the available immunity. 
     
      
    74 One issue which caused difficulty for many years was whether an accused person’s silence may be used to attack the credibility of a late explanation which he or she makes of the relevant events as opposed to inferring consciousness of guilt of the offence. Although the distinction was ridiculed by Professor Cross (The Evidence Report: Sense and Nonsense [1973] Criminal Law Review 329 at 332-334) it nevertheless gained judicial recognition until it was finally and firmly rejected by the majority in Petty. 
     
      
    75 Of course, if the accused chooses to break his or her silence and give an explanation before trial which is inconsistent with an account given in evidence, the inconsistency may be used by the prosecution, both to attack the accused’s credit, and as consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    76 There are many cases which illustrate the operation of the common law. In Glennon v The Queen (1993-1994) 179 CLR 1 the Court was concerned with the question of whether a particular misdirection given by the trial judge meant that a new trial should be ordered. The direction held to be wrong was that, in circumstances where, in his defence, the accused had called evidence which was inconsistent with the Crown case, the trial judge had said “in testing the veracity of that defence brought before you in this Court you are entitled to have regard to the fact that it was not revealed to the police and you are entitled to ask yourselves, if this explanation is true, surely the sensible thing was to tell the police about it as soon as possible.” The direction was held to impugne the accused’s right to remain silent. 
     
      
    77 The position of a witness at a trial has, so far as I am aware, not previously been considered. Perhaps this is not surprising. It would be a rare case indeed where a person would, as did Ms Innes in the present matter, confess to a serious crime when giving evidence at the trial of another person who has been accused of committing that very crime. 
     
      
    78 The attack made by the prosecutor on Ms Innes was directed to and confined to her credit. It was no part of the Crown case that the jury should find that Ms Innes had committed the crime. The Crown case was entirely inconsistent with that proposition. Accordingly, the suggestion that Ms Innes had remained silent when she should have spoken was not made for the purpose of providing a basis for inferring a consciousness that she was guilty of any offence. 
     
      
    79 There can be no doubt that Ms Innes had a right to remain silent. The evidence suggested that, at the least, she may have committed an assault and in the witness box she confessed to a more serious crime. She was under no obligation at any stage to provide an account of the events to anyone in authority. Accordingly, the question raised in the appeal is whether the prosecutor could raise her silence when the purpose was not to suggest that she may have committed a crime but merely to attack her credit. The Crown submits that because the attack was confined to matters of credit the common law right was not infringed. 
     
      
    80 There are echoes in the Crown argument in this case of the distinction between “reliance on silence as evidence against the accused, and reliance on it by way of answer to or comment upon a defence raised for the first time … at the trial” (Reg v Foster (1955) NZLR 1194 at 1200) which was the problem addressed in Petty. Although the majority in Petty acknowledged the theoretical distinction they were not prepared to allow it to operate in the criminal law. The task of separating the two concepts was too difficult. 
     
      
    81 Their Honours said at 100-101: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case, Priestley JA expressed the view that there is a ‘significant distinction’ between inferring a consciousness of guilt from silence and denying credibility to a later defence or explanation by reason of earlier silence. His Honour suggested that in the first case there can be inferred an admission by reason of the consciousness of guilt whereas in the second case rejection of the defence or explanation has no evidentiary value in itself, though its effect may be to leave the prosecution case unanswered, or at least not answered by that defence or explanation. We acknowledge that there is a theoretical distinction between the two modes of making use of the accused's earlier silence. However, we doubt that it is a distinction which would be observed in practice by a jury, even if they understand it. And, what is of more importance, the denial of the credibility of that late defence or explanation by reason of the accused's earlier silence is just another way of drawing an adverse inference (albeit less strong than an inference of guilt) against the accused by reason of his or her exercise of the right of silence. Such an erosion of the fundamental right should not be permitted. Indeed, in a case where the positive matter of explanation or defence constitutes the real issue of the trial, to direct the jury that it was open to them to draw an adverse inference about its genuineness from the fact that the accused had not previously raised it would be to convert the right to remain silent into a source of entrapment. Accordingly, the distinction is, in our view, unsound.” 
        
       
      
    82 The relevance of Ms Innes’ evidence in the appellant’s trial was, of course, that it provided the appellant with a defence. The criticism of Ms Innes’ evidence on the basis that she only provided her account at the trial carried with it a submission that the appellant’s defence should not be accepted because he had not previously advanced it. However, his right to remain silent meant that he was under no obligation to provide his account of the events or to bring forward anyone, including Ms Innes, who might explain his innocence.  
     
      
    83 The Crown was asking the jury to accept that the defence case, founded upon Ms Innes’ evidence, was a recent invention and for this reason should not be accepted. Because the appellant was under no obligation to inform the authorities of the evidence Ms Innes would give or otherwise disclose his defence, it may be that the course taken by the prosecutor and the direction given by the trial judge were not appropriate. The attack upon her account as a recent invention could be understood as an attack upon the “fundamental right” which the common law afforded to the appellant. 
     
      
    84 Whether it was otherwise open to the Crown to criticise Ms Innes’ evidence as not being creditable because she had not previously disclosed it, raises different considerations. However, because disclosure would have meant confessing to the commission of an offence, when the law provides immunity from self incrimination, the better view may be that for this reason also the cross examination and, later, directions, should not have been allowed. 
     
      
       
      The position having regard to section 89 
       
      
    85 Beyond the common law the appellant submits that the course taken by the trial judge and the prosecutor was contrary to s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  
     
      
    86 Section 89 has been carefully drafted to confine its operation. It only applies to a failure to answer or respond if in the course of “official questioning.” Official questioning means “questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.”  
     
      
    87 In the present case the police officer who investigated the incident was an investigating official. Accordingly, with respect to the essential thrust of the cross examination and direction by the judge - “why did Ms Innes not tell the truth to the police?” –s 89 is engaged. 
     
      
    88 The section only operates in relation to criminal proceedings. To my mind, this has significance for its proper construction. Subsection 1 provides that an “inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn” in the relevant circumstances. There are only two types of parties in criminal proceedings, the Crown or, in some instances, a private prosecutor, or the accused of which of course, there may be more than one. A failure by a witness to speak out at an early stage may be used to attack his or her credit, giving rise to an allegation of “recent invention” and an inference that the witness is lying. Obviously, this is an inference unfavourable to that witness. However, it was submitted that this does not raise an inference unfavourable to a party. In the present case the evidence of Ms Innes may not be believed but it is submitted this raises no inference with respect to the appellant, the only consequence is that her evidence may be disregarded. 
     
      
    89 To my mind, the section cannot bear such a confined construction. The evidence of a witness other than the accused will only be relevant because it adds to the available evidence from which the accused’s guilt or otherwise can be determined. If a witness gives evidence consistent with an accused’s innocence an attack upon the witness’ credit may lead to an inference unfavourable to the accused. In the present case the attack upon Ms Innes’ credit was intended to cause the jury to disbelieve her. As she was called by the accused in his case and gave evidence consistent with his version of the relevant events, if she was not believed, this would more readily lead to an inference that his account could not be accepted. Being an inference unfavourable to the appellant’s case it was an inference unfavourable to a party and was prohibited by the section. 
     
      
    90 This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the section expressly relates to the evidence of a “party or another person” who failed or refused to answer or respond. The reference to another person can only be given meaning if the section is referring to a witness from whose silence an inference adverse to the accused might otherwise be drawn. The only purpose in questioning Ms Innes as to her failure to tell the police of the true position was to attack the credibility of her account and press the inevitable inference adverse to the appellant upon the jury. Accordingly, s 89(2) was contravened. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 and “the proviso” 
       
      
    91 The appellant concedes that his counsel did not seek a redirection at the trial. Accordingly, leave is required: Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules 1912. 
     
      
    92 The Crown submits that leave should be refused. It is submitted that a deliberate choice was made by the appellant’s counsel which can be explained by the fact that the appropriate direction would have precluded a process of reasoning by the jury that Ms Innes might have been guilty because she had not earlier given her account and exculpated the appellant. Accordingly, it is suggested that the direction would have precluded a means by which a reasonable doubt might have been created as to the guilt of the appellant. The Crown points to the fact that at the time when evidence was given by a detective the trial judge directed the jury that the appellant had exercised his right of silence but that no adverse inference for this reason could be drawn against him. However, a similar direction was not sought in relation to the evidence of Ms Innes. It is submitted that, accordingly, the jury were able to reason that her earlier silence made it more likely that Ms Innes was guilty, as she indicated. 
     
      
    93 I do not accept this submission. To my mind, the attack upon Ms Innes’ credit, reinforced by the directions which his Honour gave, was likely to have significantly undermined her evidence. Although his Honour told the jury that Ms Innes had been told of her right not to say anything to the police, that part of the direction which reinforced the Crown’s submission of “recent invention” would have had a significant impact. His Honour’s use of the word “importantly” must also have had significant impact. 
     
      
    94 I do not accept that counsel’s failure to object or seek a redirection was for any considered forensic purpose. To my mind, it was more likely that the jury would reason that Ms Innes was lying when, although she confesses in the witness box, she had not previously suggested that she had struck Ms Bavistock. 
     
      
    95 With respect to the application of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act the Crown submits that the impugned direction did not constitute a fundamental irregularity giving rise to a significant miscarriage of justice. It was limited to the evidence of Ms Innes and was not, at least directly, referable to the evidence of the appellant. The Crown also points to the evidence of the other witnesses which would support a conviction. It is submitted that that evidence was overwhelming and it could be concluded without doubt that it was the appellant and not Ms Innes, who struck the victim in the face with the steering lock. 
     
      
    96 The circumstances in which the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act can be applied have been the subject of consideration by this Court and the High Court on many occasions. The relevant principles were discussed in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365. In summary they are: 
     
      
    · where there has been a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial, it cannot be said that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice if the applicant has thereby lost ""a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted"" (Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514) or ""a real chance of acquittal"" (R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376); · unless it can be said that, had there been no blemish in the trial, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused, the conviction must be set aside: see Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 524; R v Storey 376; Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392; · the question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That question must be answered according to its assessment of the facts of the case; · the proviso is not intended to provide, in effect, a retrial before the Court of Criminal Appeal when the proceedings before the primary court have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all. It is one thing to apply the proviso to prevent the administration of the criminal law from being ""plunged into outworn technicality"" (see Driscoll v The Queen 527); it is another to uphold a conviction after a proceeding which is fundamentally flawed, merely because the appeal court is of the opinion that on a proper trial the appellant would inevitably have been convicted;· the proviso has no application where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings;· although there is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error “it is clear that [the proviso] may be applied notwithstanding a misdirection concerning the law or the wrongful admission of evidence. In the end no mechanical approach can be adopted and each case must be determined upon its own circumstances. 
     
      
    97 In Glennon, the accused was charged with a number of sexual offences involving young people. When interviewed in relation to three of the counts he declined to answer questions. At his trial a misdirection occurred and the question before the High Court was whether the proviso should be applied. 
     
      
    98 Following the approach adopted in Wilde Mason CJ, Brennan, Toohey JJ, in their joint judgment, considered the two relevant questions. Firstly, was there a fundamental error and secondly, was a conviction inevitable. 
     
      
    99 The majority answered the first question in the negative. On that question their Honours said at 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “According to the approach of the majority in  
        Wilde 
         (1988) 164 CLR at 373, the proviso cannot be applied ""where proceedings have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all"". But that is a particular situation arising only ""where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"". In such a case the accused ""has not had a proper trial and ... there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice"" (ibid.). But the majority stressed that there is no mechanical formula or rigid test to be applied to determine whether an irregularity is of this nature; each case will depend on its own circumstances (ibid.) and, in determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error (ibid. at 374.). 
         
         
        In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial judge's misdirection on the applicant's right to silence was ""so fundamental"" that the trial was ""hardly a trial at all"". Although the right to silence is a fundamental right of any accused person, it cannot be said that any misdirection on that subject is a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in Wilde. In this case, the trial judge directed the jury that they were not to use the applicant's exercise of his right to silence in a manner adverse to him. This direction was perfectly proper. However, the trial judge then qualified the direction by informing the jury that they might use the applicant's silence to test the veracity of the applicant's defence. This subsequent direction was clearly erroneous. However, in the context in which it appeared and at a trial in which there was other evidence on which the applicant could be convicted and in which there was no other misdirection by the trial judge, the trial judge's misdirection was not a fundamental irregularity. We would reject the applicant's submissions in so far as they are based on this approach to the proviso.” 
        
       
      
    100 In my opinion, the same approach can be taken to the question of whether or not a fundamental error has occurred in the present case. Although it cannot be doubted that Ms Innes was an important witness in the defence case, her evidence fell to be assessed in light of the evidence of the Crown witnesses. The problems with her cross examination and the manner in which her evidence was treated were in part alleviated by his Honour’s directions. His Honour reminded the jury that Ms Innes, in the same way as the accused, was entitled to remain silent. His Honour stressed that “that is a factor which you would want to bear in mind.” 
     
      
    101 In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the errors which occurred at the trial are such that it can be concluded that there has been “such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings.” 
     
      
    102 With respect to the second question the joint judgment in Glennon said at 8-9: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to apply the proviso where there has been a misdirection by the trial judge that is not fundamental in the sense discussed above, the Court of Criminal Appeal must be satisfied that, in the absence of the misdirection the jury would inevitably have reached the same verdict. This is so even if the case against the accused is otherwise a strong one.” 
        
       
      
    103 To my mind, the conviction of the appellant was inevitable. The eye witness accounts from Messrs Mohr and Hammond who were strangers to any of the parties, provide convincing evidence. There is nothing to suggest that they were mistaken in their observation that the appellant was wielding the car lock rather than the appellant. 
     
      
    104 The evidence of the victim’s son Mr Martinez was also convincing. He observed the events at close quarters. There is no reason why he should lie as to the sequence of events. His account remained consistent throughout his evidence. 
     
      
    105 The central element in the defence case was the denial by the appellant that he struck Ms Bavistock . This was rejected by the jury. Although the trial judge referred to inconsistencies in the account of some of the Crown witnesses they were to my mind minor and readily explicable when the viewing point of each witness is considered. There were no contradictions which would cause me any concern with respect to the jury’s conclusion. 
     
      
    106 Accepting that the credibility of Ms Innes was affected, even seriously, by her cross examination and the directions given by the trial judge with respect to her earlier silence, the Crown case was overwhelming. I do not believe that the difficulties which occurred in relation to the evidence of Ms Innes caused the appellant to lose a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him. 
     
      
    107 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

    REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, whose name has been suppressed until further order of this Court, has pleaded guilty to the murder of his adoptive parents at their home at Glen Alpine on 8 January 2000.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 The basic facts are not in dispute. The offender was the only child of the deceased, and had been adopted by them shortly after his birth on 25 January 1979.  
     
      
    3 On 9 January 2000, a park ranger was conducting a routine patrol of Heathcote National Park, when he observed an area of mesh fence on the western side of Pipeline Road to be missing. Pipeline Road is a fire/service road running off Heathcote Road. The ranger got out of his vehicle and looked over an embankment. About twenty metres below him he saw a Mitsubishi Magna sedan, which belonged to the offender’s father. Inside the car were the father, in the driver’s seat, and the offender’s mother, in the front passenger seat. Both were deceased. 
     
      
    4 Police attended the scene. In due course, a post-mortem examination was conducted and at that stage the deaths were considered to be accidental. There was no inquest. Later, however, concerns about the matter were expressed by the deceased mother’s sister, Mrs Margaret Urwin and her husband, Alan Urwin. The forensic pathologist provided an amended report to the coroner in relation to each of the deceased, in which he said that he could not exclude death by foul play.  
     
      
    5 In relation to the father, the doctor noted that were bilateral thyroid cartilage fractures which could indicate some form of neck compression, and he could not exclude the possibility that he was dead before the vehicle left the road. He could not exclude the same possibility in relation to the mother. Toxicological analysis of the blood of each of them showed the presence of a sedative drug. In relation to both deceased he noted bruising on their arms and legs which was not consistent with trauma from a road accident, and the extent and severity of which were suggestive of some form of restraint or assault. 
     
      
    6 On 11 January 2000, police obtained a statement from the offender. He said that on 8 January he returned to the Glen Alpine home with a friend, to find that his parents were not there. He was not concerned about this, and he and his friend stayed at the home that night. It was not until later the following day that he was informed that his parents were deceased. The friend to whom he referred is the man whom he was later to name as his accomplice in the killings. On 15 November 2002 he took part in an electronically recorded interview with police, in which he was asked about conversations he was said to have had with another friend, both before and after the death of his parents, which suggested that he had planned and been involved in their deaths. He denied any such involvement.  
     
      
    7 There the matter rested until 1 February 2004, when he was confronted about the matter by Margaret Urwin, in the presence of her husband, and admitted that he was involved in the death of his parents. The police were informed, and on the following day he confirmed and expanded upon those admissions in videotaped interviews at a police station, at Pipeline Road and at the Glen Alpine home. He was charged with the murders the following day. 
     
      
    8 In those interviews he gave a detailed account of how he and an accomplice killed his parents and disposed of their bodies. He also admitted that the murders had been planned, for a financial motive, and that the method of the killings and disposal of the bodies had been decided over the two previous days. His father had been in employment and his mother was the proprietor of a child minding centre. They were well off. About two weeks before the killings he had discussed with his accomplice what he stood to gain by way of inheritance in the event of his parents’ death. 
     
      
    9 Over the two days prior to the murders, the accomplice suggested that the parents be killed and offered to help the offender to do so. It was he who proposed the way in which the crimes should be carried out. It was agreed that he would be paid $17,000 for his assistance. The offender frankly acknowledged that his motive was to inherit a large sum of money. He denied that he (or his accomplice) bore any animosity towards his parents. Indeed, he said that he had had a loving relationship with them and that he had been well provided for. 
     
      
    10 On the evening in question, the offender and his accomplice went to the Glen Alpine home. His mother was in an upstairs bedroom and his father was watching television in the lounge room. He made a cup of tea for both of them, placing in each cup some sedative tablets supplied by his accomplice, which he understood to be Serapax. The intention was to asphyxiate them with a pillow while they were unconscious, and it was the accomplice who was to do this.  
     
      
    11 The offender waited outside the house while the accomplice asphyxiated his mother in the bedroom. It would seem that she was not unconscious, and he heard a sound emanate from her like a cry or a gasp. The accomplice then emerged from the house and told the offender that he would need some help with his father. The two men went into the lounge room, where the father was lying on a lounge, apparently drowsy. He held his father’s legs while the accomplice held a pillow over his face. The father struggled for several minutes before he died. The offender demonstrated how this was done during the videotaped interview at the house.  
     
      
    12 The two men then carried the deceased to the Magna sedan, which was in the garage. The mother was placed in the front passenger seat. The offender could not recall where the father was placed but, most likely, it was on the back seat. The accomplice drove the Magna to the site at Pipeline Road, and he followed in his mother’s car, a Hyundai coupe. There, the accomplice placed the father’s body in the driver’s seat of the Magna and the offender helped him push the car over the embankment. They left the scene in the Hyundai, driven by the offender.  
     
      
    13 He told police that he had smoked a small amount of cannabis early that day, and was under the influence of that drug “a little bit” at the time of the killings. I shall return to the question of his injection of drugs and his state of mind at the relevant time. 
     
      
    14 The report of another forensic pathologist confirmed that the bilateral fractures of the father’s thyroid cartilage were typical of strangulation by compression of the throat. The mother had a heavy bruise on the inner aspect of her left upper arm, typically observed when a person has been pinioned or forcibly moved. Bruises on her forearms were characteristic of her having been gripped tightly, suggesting a scuffle. The same was true of bruises to her legs. The amount of sedative detected in the father’s blood was enough to have made him drowsy. However, there was a lesser amount in the mother’s blood and it was unlikely that it would have had any significant effect upon her.  
     
      
    15 In due course, the offender inherited his parents’ estate, of a value of about $800,000. He sold the family home and the child minding centre to Mr and Mrs Urwin, and bought a home for himself. In the event, he did not pay his accomplice the promised $17,000.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    16 The offender was twenty years old at the time of the murders, and is now twenty-six. He has a minor criminal record, of no present significance. He left school during year eleven, and had employment in a variety of unskilled positions. At the time of his arrest he was married and was the father of an infant child. His wife had two older children from a previous relationship. 
     
      
    17 I have before me psychiatric reports of Dr Christopher Canaris, engaged on behalf of the offender, and Dr Stephen Allnutt, engaged by the Crown. Dr Allnutt also gave evidence. To both doctors the offender gave a history of polydrug abuse, and auditory and visual hallucinations, from about the age of eighteen. Dr Canaris reported that the history was consistent with chronic schizophrenia. Dr Allnutt was somewhat less specific, seeing him as having suffered a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  
     
      
    18 The offender also told the doctors that on the day in question he had used not only cannabis but a variety of other drugs, and that he was experiencing hallucinations at the time of the killings. As I have said, he told police that he had used only cannabis that day. He also said in the interview that he used ecstasy and amphetamines “once in a while”, but he appears then to have been speaking at the time of the interview which, of course, was some four years after the murders. He also denied having been diagnosed with any psychiatric illness, but that is not necessarily inconsistent with the history he gave the doctors. He may not have had insight into his symptoms, and it does not appear that he had any psychiatric treatment until he was taken into custody.  
     
      
    19 What emerges from the evidence as a whole is that, prior to the death of his parents, he used mainly cannabis, although it may be that he also had resort to other drugs. After their death, his drug use escalated and embraced a variety of substances. His psychiatric illness also developed, whenever its onset may have been, and he has been under psychiatric treatment, including medication, since being in custody. 
     
      
    20 The Crown prosecutor, very fairly and properly, accepted that the offender might have been in the early phase of development of a mental illness at the time of the killings, and that that factor took the case out of the worst category calling for imprisonment for the term of his natural life. That said, the psychiatric evidence conveys that the effect of that condition on his criminal behaviour would have been minimal.  
     
      
    21 I am prepared to accept that he was affected by a drug to a degree at the time, and that his mental condition and his use of that drug impaired his judgment and made him more susceptible to the influence of his accomplice, who was an older man. I am also prepared to accept, not without some misgivings, that he was to some extent influenced by his accomplice, who conceived the idea of killing his parents and formulated the plan to put it into effect. However, these matters cannot significantly mitigate the gravity of his crimes which, his counsel acknowledged, demonstrated “a high degree of culpability”. 
     
      
    22 It seems that he has been compliant with his medication while in custody, and that his psychotic symptoms have abated. Both psychiatrists were of the view that, provided he remains compliant with psychiatric treatment, he is unlikely to represent a danger to the community in the future. Dr Allnutt gave evidence that this involves his remaining drug free, because of the relationship between his psychosis and his drug abuse. Dr Canaris emphasised the importance of his maintaining contact with mental health services upon his eventual release. If these conditions are met, it seems to me, his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable.  
     
      
       
      Pleas of guilty and assistance 
       
      
    23 The offender pleaded guilty to the two counts of murder before me on 10 October 2005. However, upon his arraignment on 1 April 2005 his legal representatives conveyed to the Crown that the only issue at a trial would be his mental state, the intention being to raise a defence of substantial impairment under s23A of the Crimes Act. Indeed, that had been indicated to the Crown in an informal way before that date. This bears, of course, upon the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    24 In addition, the Crown prosecutor acknowledged that it is unlikely the offender could ever have been charged with the killings but for his admissions to the police. Those admissions, together with his escalating drug use after the killings, suggest a developing sense of guilt about his crimes and tend to support the genuineness of an expression of remorse recorded in the first report of Dr Canaris. Furthermore, a sealed exhibit contains documents establishing that he has provided further assistance to the authorities of a significant kind, and has undertaken to continue to do so.  
     
      
       
      Victim impact statement 
       
      
    25 I have received a victim impact statement from Mrs Margaret Urwin, written for her own part and on behalf of her family. That statement speaks eloquently of her love of her sister and brother-in-law, her shock and grief at their tragic loss, and the enduring effects upon her of these appalling crimes. I extend to Mrs Urwin and her family my deepest sympathy. The approach of a sentencing judge to a statement of this kind is now well settled, and I need not repeat it. My sentencing task requires the balance of a number of factors, some of them competing, but the starting point must be clear recognition of the undoubted gravity of these offences. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    26 For what it is worth, I accept that the offender hoped that his parents would be unconscious when they were asphyxiated and would feel no pain. That was not to be the case. It is apparent that both the unfortunate victims struggled before they expired. The offender stands for sentence for two premeditated murders, committed for financial gain. Moreover, the victims were his adoptive parents, who had loved him and provided for him. If there was anyone from whom they should have feared no harm, it was he. Viewed objectively, these crimes call for condign punishment.  
     
      
    27 On the other hand, appropriate weight must be given to his relative youth, his lack of any significant criminal record and his favourable prospects of rehabilitation. More importantly, his pleas of guilty, his co-operation with investigating police and the assistance to the authorities to which I have referred must be recognised. It is in the community’s interest that co-operation and assistance of that kind be encouraged, and those factors entitle him to a significant measure of leniency. However, recognition of them must not be allowed to reduce the sentence to a level which is unreasonably disproportionate to the gravity of these offences.  
     
      
    28 Although the two murders are closely linked in time and circumstances, the sentences should be partly cumulative. Relevant aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are apparent from these reasons, and need not be repeated. The crimes having been committed in 2000, the case is unaffected by the 2002 amendments to that Act, introducing standard non-parole periods and altering the manner in which sentences are to be pronounced. In respect of each sentence, I shall depart from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period by reason only of the partial accumulation. Any effective non-parole period lower than that which I propose would be inadequate to mark the offenders’ criminality. On the other hand, the overall sentence which I propose allows him the opportunity of an extended period at liberty in the community subject to the sanction of parole. That also is in the community’s interest.  
     
      
    29 It is desirable that I indicate the aggregate sentence I would have imposed but for the offender’s pleas of guilty, his co-operation with police and his assistance to the authorities. I shall then express as a percentage the reduction of sentence which the combination of those factors has earned him, and it is necessary that I specify the proportion of that reduction referable to the assistance to the authorities which he has undertaken in the future. In other circumstances, these factors might have earned him a discount of sentence in the order of forty percent. However, I consider that such a reduction would produce an aggregate sentence unreasonably disproportionate to the seriousness of his crimes. The discount I propose is thirty percent. Of that I would assign twelve percent to future assistance. 
     
      
    30 But for the pleas of guilty, the co-operation and the assistance, I would have imposed sentences aggregating imprisonment for forty years. The thirty percent reduction produces an overall sentence of twenty-eight years. The sentences will be structured so as to provide an effective non-parole period of twenty-two years. The first sentence to be imposed will date from the day he was taken into custody, 2 February 2004.  
     
      
    31 The offender is sentenced for the murder of his father to imprisonment for twenty-five years, with a non-parole period of nineteen years, to date from 2 February 2004. For the murder of his mother he is sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-five years, with a non-parole period of nineteen years, to date from 2 February 2007. He will be eligible for release on parole on 1 February 2026.

     Judgment 
     
     
       
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hosking DCJ at Sydney District Court. 
     
      
    2 On 4 March 2005 the applicant was sentenced on a charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (ketamine) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole of four and a half years commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 January 2009 and a total term of seven and a half years commencing on the first mentioned date. 
     
      
    3 Taken into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure was an offence of possessing another prohibited drug, methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    4 On 21 July 2004 police obtained a search warrant for residential premises occupied by the applicant. Upon arrival the applicant declined to open the door and it was forced by use of a sledgehammer. Thereafter police commenced their search and the applicant indicated that he would point out to police where the material, which he apprehended they were searching for, was located. Accordingly, the drugs were seized and the applicant arrested and taken to the police station where he declined to be electronically interviewed. He indicated his plea of guilty at the Local Court. 
     
      
    5 The applicant had a prior record, significant items being convictions in relation to cultivating cannabis in 1992, 1993 and 1999 and also for supplying cannabis in 1999 in respect of which offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of nine months with an additional term of six months. 
     
      
    6 The applicant is a disabled pensioner aged thirty-seven years. His disability relates to renal failure and there was evidence before his Honour that whilst in custody prior to sentence the applicant had been taken three times a week for dialysis. It is clear that his custody will be rendered more than usually onerous by the requirements of treatment for this condition. His Honour was aware of these circumstances and expressly took them into account.  
     
      
    7 It is to be noted that for the offence there is a prescribed standard non-parole period of ten years directly applicable where there is conviction after trial. Nevertheless the parliamentary prescription offers some relevant guidance and as I have observed, the non-parole period set by his Honour is less than half the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    8 The first ground of appeal is focussed upon an observation in his Honour’s remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “….in terms of S21A factors there are not many aggravating factors. The factors that I have mentioned that he has got a record of previous convictions including for this kind of offence is an aggravating factor….” 
        
       
       
      
    9 This Court has often been required previously to comment upon the unfortunate inclusion of prior record in the statutory provision which must be read subject to the qualifications of the law including the circumstance that, in general, the existence of a prior record is a factor which deprives leniency that might otherwise be sought rather than aggravating the circumstances of the offence: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 and R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109. 
     
      
    10 As observed, the applicant had numerous prior convictions related to drugs and the need for personal deterrence arising therefrom in accordance in the principles discussed in Veen v Queen (No 2) 164 CLR 465 are applicable and do not require repetition. 
     
      
    11 His Honour’s choice of language may not be ideal to the circumstances. I am unpersuaded that analysis gives rise to a call for intervention by this Court. Mr Smith of counsel has pointed out that his Honour twice made reference to the existence of prior convictions, but I cannot see, in the context of his Honour’s remarks, that this is a matter of any consequence. 
     
      
    12 The second ground of appeal complains that the sentence is manifestly excessive. It is true that the learned sentencing judge was unable to make a finding as to the applicant’s role or relationship to the Ketamine but the objective circumstance was that he was in possession of a commercial quantity of this drug. In fact the quantity exceeded the commercial level by a factor of more than twice. 
     
      
    13 However, Mr Smith has drawn our attention specifically to some remarks made by his Honour concerning the approach which he took. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ketamine is a drug which has not been a prohibited drug at least under the terms of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         for very long. I think it was first included in the schedule to the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         some time in 2003. Therefore there are few statistics available or comparable cases for me to get any sentencing guidance from. I do have, as I say, of course the maximum penalty. I do have the standard minimum non-parole period both of which, as I have said, are indicators.  
         
         
        Ketamine appears to me to be a drug of the order of seriousness of drugs such as amphetamine and some assistance is gained by looking at statistics in relation to commercial supplies or supplies in the commercial quantity of drugs of that kind.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14 It has been pointed out by counsel that the prescribed commercial quantities of amphetamines and ketamine are in fact different. It seems to me that it was inappropriate for his Honour to look at statistics regarding amphetamine for guidance in this case. 
     
      
    15 Our attention is also drawn to some remarks of Howie J in R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court no longer approached the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence,  
        R v Nai Poon 
         2003 56 NSWLR 284,  
        R v Neale 
         2004 138 A Crim R 493.  
        The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         does not distinguish in any way between cocaine and methylamphetamine the maximum penalty for offences involving the two drugs is the same, as are the prescribed quantities.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 As has been mentioned, the prescribed quantities for amphetamine and ketamine are in fact not the same. It seems to me that it would have been inappropriate to look at statistics for the purpose of guidance concerning this matter at offences that involved amphetamines. Nevertheless in the end what must be examined is whether or not the sentence ultimately imposed is such that a different sentence should be imposed. 
     
      
    17 The applicant also complains that his Honour did not specify the discount which he granted to the applicant on account of his plea of guilty. He was not obliged so to do. Reconstruction of his sentence would suggest that he had in mind a total sentence of 10 years which, as I have previously stated, happens to be the prescribed standard non-parole period, rather than total sentence if such is applicable, and this has been reduced to seven and a half years indicating a discount of 25 per cent, being the maximum of the suggested range in The Queen v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    18 His Honour’s remarks on sentence demonstrate that he overlooked no relevant matter, and although the applicant’s plight attracts sympathy I am unable to perceive that his Honour has not given to the applicant as full a measure of mitigation as was reasonable to the circumstances. It was submitted that by reason of the applicant’s illness he had found himself and his family financially struggling but as the Crown Prosecutor has observed, many families struggle on government benefits without resorting to criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    19 In the end the question for this Court is not whether or not in any way his Honour may have had reference to an incorrect analogy, but whether or not, in the view of this Court, some other sentence should be imposed. I am of opinion that the sentence imposed was entirely appropriate to the facts and circumstances. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal 
     
      
    20 ROTHMAN J: During the course of argument counsel for the applicant referred the Court to a judgment of mine in DBN [2005] NSWCCA 435. I reiterate the comments made at paragraphs 28 and 29, and I consider that this case, like that, is one where the errors, if any, in the application of s 21A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act seem to have had little or no effect on the sentence ultimately passed. With that additional remark I would agree with the reasons of his Honour Grove J and the orders that he proposes 
     
      
    21 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v SIMON LOWE 
      
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
     1 GROVE J: An application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence is listed today. Mr Lowe was formerly represented by counsel but has this morning appeared in person.  
     
      
    2 The first application he makes is for adjournment of the hearing of the application. He has indicated to the Court that his intention is to appeal against the conviction which was entered after his plea of guilty. Given the circumstances which I am about to relate, I am of a view that the application for adjournment should be refused and the application should be dealt with in the manner which I now propose. 
     
      
    3 This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ. On 13 August 2004 the applicant pleaded guilty before his Honour to an indictment charging him with an offence of intimidation contrary to s 562AB of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum prescribed penalty of imprisonment for five years. The offence took place over a period spanning July 2001 to January 2002. The victim was a woman with whom the applicant had been in a relationship. By the time the matter came before the court, the applicant gave evidence that he had recognised the termination of that relationship and entered a new relationship, and there was therefore no prospect of repeat offence. 
     
      
    4 It might be noted that on 15 October 2003 the applicant had been convicted at Gosford Local Court of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he had been sentenced to imprisonment for three months. He appealed against that sentence and it was dealt with by his Honour at the same time as the indictment. He confirmed the conviction but set aside the sentence and in lieu thereof ordered the applicant to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of two years.  
     
      
    5 It might be observed that the proceedings were heard with some informality. The applicant’s representative sought that for the offence of intimidation the applicant be placed on recognisance, and the Crown had expressed a view that his Honour would not be falling into appealable error (as it was put) in not imposing a term of custody. It is clear from the transcript that his Honour was aware of these submissions but came to the conclusion that the applicant’s offence should be met with the imposition of some custody, but that this should be suspended for its term. In the event, he sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months which was suspended upon his entering a recognisance for that period to be of good behaviour.  
     
      
    6 The applicant lodged a notice of intention to appeal on 6 September 2004 but did not lodge his notice of appeal and application for an extension of time until 12 August 2005, that is to say after the expiry of the entire period of twelve months during which he was subject to the suspended sentence. A notice of appeal was finally lodged on 16 August 2005. 
     
      
    7 It is not suggested by the Crown that there has been any operative breach during the currency of the suspended sentence between 13 August 2004 and 12 August 2005. The application does not seek setting aside of the conviction although the applicant has indicated his intention as I have earlier set out. One would be pardoned however for being prompted to wonder why the application as filed is now being pressed. 
     
      
    8 A written submission by counsel, now no longer appearing for the applicant, contended that the learned sentencing judge had committed four errors. First it was said that he did not properly consider all possible alternatives. As I have noted, the proceedings were conducted with some informality, and it is perfectly obvious that in response to counsel’s remarks about non-custodial options his Honour was expressing his view that they were not appropriate.  
     
      
    9 It was contended that he had erred in not fixing a non-parole period or giving reasons for declining to do so. Whilst the technical correctness of the statutory obligation being unfulfilled can be observed, there is no point to be served. The setting of a non-parole period involves eligibility for release from custody. At no time can this applicant be committed to custody in respect of this expired sentence. 
     
      
    10 It is next said that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the plea of guilty. It is true that he did not incant this circumstance, but a reading of the transcript makes it abundantly clear that the whole hearing was conducted with its focus upon the plea of guilty and the applicant’s explanation that in the years which had passed since the offence, he had moved on to a new relationship. 
     
      
    11 The fourth ground asserted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The facts showed that at the relevant time a persistent refusal by the applicant to recognise the termination of the relationship and harassing conduct on his part of such seriousness that it led to the indicted charge. A sentence of twelve months imprisonment, wholly suspended, was in my opinion not manifestly excessive. However, as the circumstances which I have related show, this application has little practical focus.  
     
      
    12 It might be mentioned in passing that, in any event, the applicant would be on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a further year after the expiry of the recognisance in respect of the suspended sentence by reason of the separate matter of appeal from the Local Court dealt with by his Honour.  
     
      
    13 As I have said, I would refuse the application for adjournment. I regard this application as entirely without merit and would refuse leave to appeal 
     
      
    14 ROTHMAN J: I agree with the reasons of Grove J and the orders that are proposed. 
     
      
    15 GROVE J: Leave to appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Nield DCJ at Sydney District Court.  
     
      
    2 The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges of supplying a commercial quantity and also supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, in each case, heroin. He is aged forty one years and has a wife and three children who apparently reside in Vietnam. 
     
      
    3 On 2 July 2003 he entered Sydney on a flight from Hong Kong in company with a co-offender Fung. Fung returned to Hong Kong on 9 July, the applicant following on 19 July. On 10 August they returned to Australia on a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne.  
     
      
    4 They and others were subject to surveillance by authorities including telecommunications intercepts. When arrested the applicant was in possession of two telephones which had been subscribed to in fictitious names. Critical events took place on 21 August. The applicant and one Hoang were seen to travel in a vehicle and the movement of a white plastic bag was observed. The applicant entered with the bag into premises of one Tran. Shortly afterwards he spoke to Fung by telephone. Other relevant conversations with another offender Lo had also been intercepted. 
     
      
    5 In due course Hoang and Lo were stopped by police riding in a vehicle at Ashfield at about 8.45 pm. A plastic bag containing 1.4067 kgs of heroin (the large commercial quantity) of 65.6 to 71.1 percent purity was seized.  
     
      
    6 Earlier in the night at 6.50 pm Tran had been arrested and at 9.04 pm he was taken to his residence where a search warrant was executed and 834.7 grams of heroin of 71.5 percent purity as well as $359,000 in cash was seized. 
     
      
    7 The appellant and Fung were arrested at about 9.10 pm in the foyer of the Star City Casino. 
     
      
    8 For the first count of supplying a commercial quantity of drugs (that found in Tran’s residence) the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment commencing on 21 August 2003 for nine years four months two weeks with a non parole period of six years eight months two weeks expiring on 4 May 2010. On the second count of supplying a large commercial quantity (that seized from the vehicle occupied by Hoang and Lo) he was sentenced to imprisonment commencing on 7 January 2008 for thirteen years one month two weeks with non parole period of eight years one month two weeks expiring on 20 February 2016. The lastmentioned is the first parole eligibility date. 
     
      
    9 The effective overall sentence amounted to seventeen years six months with a non parole period of twelve years six months. As an issue of parity has been raised, it is convenient to note the situations of co-offenders. 
     
      
    10 We have been informed that Fung pleaded not guilty and any sentence received by her would lack the important element of discount for a plea of guilty. Tran, we are told, pleaded guilty to a lesser amount of drug, presumably that which was seized at his home, being a commercial, but not a large commercial, quantity.  
     
      
    11 Both Hoang and Lo had been dealt with by O’Reilly DCJ and McLoughlin DCJ respectively, prior to the applicant appearing for sentence and Nield DCJ was aware of the circumstances and outcomes of those proceedings. The relevant remarks on sentence are also before this Court. 
     
      
    12 O’Reilly DCJ noted that the Crown accepted that Hoang was an assistant to Fung, Lo and the applicant. He found that he was “well removed from the centre of operation” and subject to the direction of the applicant. As well as discount for the plea of guilty he was given material consideration for assistance to authority. He was charged with one count of being knowingly concerned in the supply of a commercial quantity of drug and received a sentence ultimately reduced to imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of two years. 
     
      
    13 Lo was charged and pleaded guilty to identical counts as those preferred against the applicant. McLoughlin DCJ found that his role was at the lower end of the scale and “could not be considered pivotal”. On the charge of supplying the large commercial quantity of heroin Lo was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years six months with a non parole period of seven years, to commence on 21 August 2003, the non parole period expiring on 20 August 2010. On the charge of supplying a commercial quantity of drug, to imprisonment commencing on 21 August 2008 consisting of a total term of six years with a non parole period of four years. This represented an effective sentence of eleven years imprisonment with a non parole period of nine years. 
     
      
    14 However, this Court, differently constituted, varied the orders of McLoughlin DCJ so as to create an effective sentence for Lo of eleven years with a non parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    15 This is to be contrasted with the effective sentence assessed by his Honour for the applicant of a total of seventeen years six months with, after finding special circumstances, a non parole period of twelve years six months. 
     
      
    16 The applicant argues a series of grounds, in short, complaining of the regard paid by his Honour to the principle of totality, parity with the sentences received by Lo both at first instance and later on at appeal, the imposition of sentences by his Honour first for the large commercial quantity followed by the commercial quantity rather than in the other order, the absence of finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend and that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    17 There was no obligation upon his Honour to impose sentences in any particular order and that contention can be rejected without elaboration. Nor was his Honour obliged to make subjective findings favourable to the applicant as suggested. 
     
      
    18 As he observed, he knew little about the applicant. It is true that there is arguable contradiction in his mention of a wife and family in Vietnam and his later statement that he was unable to say whether the applicant had family support there or in Hong Kong or Australia. However, the mere existence of a family is not evidence that that family is supportive and I see no prompt for intervention arising from his Honour’s remarks in these regards. That McLoughlin DCJ made favourable findings for Lo based upon broadly similar material is irrelevant. 
     
      
    19 It is convenient to deal with the contentions of the applicant concerning totality and parity together. I find this observation by his Honour somewhat cryptic when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to totality, I recognize that the offender committed two distinct and different offences, both involving significant quantities of heroin, but I accept that the offences related to one very significant quantity of heroin.” 
        
       
      
    20 He had earlier noted the express submission of counsel that “there was in reality one continuing transaction, that being to supply the total quantity of the heroin” and the passage quoted would seem to represent his Honour’s finding in relation to that submission. 
     
      
    21 The effect of his orders for accumulation however, when analysed, would seem to reflect two very separate offences, the second term not commencing until approximately five years of a total non parole period of six years eight months two weeks applicable to the first count had been served. The consequential orders do not appear to take into account the element of unity which the submission of counsel and his Honour’s observations suggest had been, at least to an extent, accepted.  
     
      
    22 There can be no argument that it was open to his Honour to determine that the applicant’s position in the hierarchy of the criminal enterprise was higher than that of Lo. It was, I would respectfully comment, obviously correct to reject counsel’s submission that he should be treated more leniently than Lo, nevertheless the applicant should be sentenced for what he has done, not his position in the hierarchy simpliciter: Olbrich v The Queen  1999 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    23 Clearly he came to Australia to engage in crime. He made two journeys and although of course he is not charged with importation it is legitimate to consider his intent in entering this country. He was personally involved in the delivery to Tran of the commercial quantity. He was active in the coded telephone communications about the whole of the heroin. He was manifestly an organizer and a person to whom others turned for instructions. 
     
      
    24 However, whilst he cannot claim parity with Lo, he is, in my view, entitled to be aggrieved by the extent of the difference between the heavy effective sentence received by him and that received by Lo for the identical offences, even allowing that their respective conduct may have been at different levels of seriousness. 
     
      
    25 I am also conscious that, although his Honour made a finding of special circumstances, the ultimate overall effect was to depart from the statutory proportion in favour of the applicant by only a little over 3 percent. I would also make a finding of special circumstances for the reasons given by his Honour and continue to apply discount for the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    26 I would substitute an overall effective term consisting of a non parole period of ten years and a total term of fourteen years for the existing specifications of twelve and a half years non parole period and total term of seventeen and a half years.  
     
      
    27 To give effect to those findings I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal is granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed. 
       
      3. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (a) On count one, for supplying a commercial quantity of prohibited drug to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years commencing on 21 August 2003 and expiring on 20 August 2008, and a total term of eight years commencing on 21 August 2003; 
         
        (b) On count two, for supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of seven years commencing on 21 August 2006 and expiring on 20 August 2013, with a total term of eleven years commencing on 21 August 2006. 
        
       
      5. The first date of eligibility for parole is specified as 20 August 2013. 
       
      
    28 ROTHMAN J: I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and for the reasons expressed. 
     
      
    29 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: In his judgment, which I have had the privilege of reading in draft, Howie J confirms the principle that this Court when considering matters of parity between co-offenders will not reduce a sentence which is otherwise adequate by reason of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender that is inadequate. 
     
      
    2 In Liu v R [2005] NSWCCA 450 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the High Court has stressed the need for consistency in punishment, particularly of co-offenders, this does not have the consequence that if in all the circumstances a co-offender should have received a greater sentence than the other offender, the latter may complain of a justifiable grievance requiring intervention by this Court. If the error has been made when sentencing another offender the co-offender’s grievance may not require the intervention of this Court.” 
        
       
      
    3 The fundamental principle is that this Court will only intervene when an applicant can demonstrate a justifiable sense of grievance. This is unlikely to be the case when the only error which has been made is the imposition of an inadequate sentence on a co-offender. 
     
      
    4 I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    5 HOWIE J: The applicant, Stefan Barta, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences involving the supply of heroin. The first was an offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of the drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). The maximum penalty for this offence is relevantly imprisonment for 20 years. The second offence was supplying that drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A of the Act for which offence there is also prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court. 
     
      
    6 He adhered to his pleas of guilty in that court and was sentenced for those offences on 25 July 2002 by Judge Hosking SC (the Judge) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) for the offence under s 25(2), and taking into account a number of matters on a Form 1, imprisonment for six years and eight months from 1 July 2003 with a non-parole period of five years to expire on 30 June 2008; 
         
         
        (b) for the offence under s 25A to imprisonment for five years from 1 October 2001 with a non-parole period of three years and nine months to expire on 30 June 2005. 
         
        
       
      This results in an overall sentence of imprisonment for eight years and five months to date from 1 October 2001 with an overall minimum period to be served of six years and nine months to expire on 30 June 2008 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
       
      
    7 The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to make an application for leave to appeal against that sentence. There was no objection by the Crown to time being extended. The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I The learned sentencing judge erred in adding a discrete period of imprisonment of 18 months to the sentence imposed on the s 25(2) charge in order to take into account the matters on the Form 1; 
         
         
        2. The learned sentence judge erred in structuring the head sentences and non-parole periods specified so that in the result the applicant is required to serve more than 80% of his overall sentence in custody before being eligible for release to parole; 
         
         
        3. The sentence imposed on the applicant is excessive having regard to the sentences imposed on two of his co-offenders Anthony Markarian (see R v Markarian [2005] NSWCCA 264) and Vincent Caccamo ( see R v Caccamo [2005] NSWCCA 257). 
        
       
      
    8 The offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin (the s 25(2) offence) related to a period between 9 April 2000 and 13 June 2000 and involved 394 grams of heroin. The commercial quantity for that drug as prescribed by the Act is 250 grams. The offence of on-going supply (the s 25A offence) related to a period between 26 September 2001 and 1 October 2001. The offences on the Form 1 were: (i) supply 119 grams of heroin between 4 and 21 October 2000; (ii) receiving a stolen computer between 26 and 27 September 2001; (iii) conducting premises for the supply of prohibited drugs on 1 October 2001; (iv) goods in custody of $1,300 on 1 October 2001; (v) goods in custody of $20,600 on 1 October 2001. 
     
      
    9 There was an agreed statement of facts that the Judge set out in full in his remarks on sentence. They can be summarised for present purposes. As a result of the lawful interception of the telephone service of Vincent Caccamo, a drug supplier, police learned that the applicant was one of the sources of the drugs he supplied. The police conducted an investigation of the applicant using telephone intercepts, listening devices, surveillance, bank records and an induced statement by Caccamo. They ascertained that over a period of about nine weeks the applicant supplied Caccamo with 349 grams of heroin said to have a street value of $197,000. On an almost daily basis, and sometimes more frequently, Caccamo was driven to the applicant’s premises in Croydon Park where he purchased seven grams of heroin from the applicant at a cost of $2,000. These facts give rise to the s 25(2) offence. 
     
      
    10 Police reinstated telephone intercepts on the applicant’s service on 25 September 2001. These intercepts revealed that from 25 September 2001 until his arrest on 1 October 2001 the applicant was actively engaged in the supply of heroin to a number of persons including Caccamo. There were identified 46 separate occasions during this period when the applicant supplied heroin totalling about 213 grams. The supplies were often in the amount of seven grams but could be from 1 to 28 grams. These facts gave rise to the s 25A offence. 
     
      
    11 On 1 October police arrested Caccamo after he left the applicant’s premises with seven grams of heroin. The applicant was arrested shortly after and his premises were searched revealing a number of luxury items including “designer clothes”. In the kitchen police located packing tape, plastic bags, electronic scales and a heat-sealing machine. The applicant owned two motor vehicles and the police asserted he had had no other form of income. The applicant was linked with premises in Hampton Street Croydon Park in which police found two drug presses, 1.5 grams of heroin, and electronic scales. There appeared to be no person living in those premises. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was aged 37 at the date of sentencing. In 1993 he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the offence of supply a prohibited drug. He was placed on a bond in 1995 for goods in custody. The applicant was born and raised in Romania by his grandparents after his parents separated when the applicant was aged 2 years. He attempted to leave Romania in 1988 but was arrested and spent 14 months in custody. He married after his release and came with his wife to Australia in 1990 after a period spent in refugee camps in Yugoslavia. He and his wife were divorced in 1992. The applicant remarried in 1998 and has two children from that union. He told the officer preparing the pre-sentence report that from 1995 until his arrest he spent a large amount of time in Romania and his income came through the sale of motor vehicles. 
     
      
    13 The applicant claimed that he commenced using cocaine in 1996 and from February 2000 until his arrest was using up to 2 grams a day. The applicant claimed that he sold drugs to support his cocaine addiction. There was a report in evidence from a drug counsellor who had interviewed the applicant in custody. The applicant told the counsellor that he used cocaine to overcome depression after his first marriage ended. He claimed to be drug free while in custody. The counsellor considered that the applicant was attempting to change his past behaviour. 
     
      
    14 The first ground of appeal relates to what is said to be an error by the Judge in specifying the amount by which he was increasing the otherwise appropriate sentence for the s 25(2) offence to take into account the Form 1 matters. The Judge stated that, had it not been for the plea and assistance, he would have imposed a sentence of nine years imprisonment for the s 25(2) offence and “would have added to that an additional eighteen months for the various Form 1 matters”. The Judge then discounted that sentence by 35 per cent and derived a sentence of six years and eight months. 
     
      
    15 In support of this ground of appeal reliance is placed upon the following passage from the judgment of the Chief Justice in Attorney General’s Application (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [44] The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences. (See R v Kay at [69].) 
         
         
        [45] The suggestion in the Attorney’s proposed guideline that the increase in penalty should normally be specified may have been appropriate if the Attorney’s basic approach were to be adopted, ie that in some senses sentences were being imposed for the Form 1 offences. Once that approach is rejected, specification of quantum is inappropriate. 
         
        
       
      
    16 There was no reason in the present case for the Judge to quantify the effect of the Form 1 matters on the sentence for the s 25(2) offence and his Honour did not indicate why he took that exceptional course. Of course, a court must make some decision as to the additional penalty that is to be imposed for the offence for which sentence is being passed by reason of the effect of the matters on the Form 1. Clearly the court must translate that effect into an increase in the sentence by an identifiable amount. The difficulty with stating that amount, as the Judge did in the present case, is that it at least gives the appearance that the offender is being sentenced to a discrete period of imprisonment for the matters appearing on the Form 1 yet the offender has not been convicted of those offences. That is why such a course was considered by the Chief Justice to be inappropriate. 
     
      
    17 But it does not follow that the Judge’s discretion necessarily miscarried in determining that an appropriate starting sentence for the s 25(2) offence and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 was ten years six months before applying the discount for the plea and assistance. The 18 months, as representing the effect of the Form 1 matters, does not itself appear to be excessive having regard to the seriousness of the supply offence being taken into account. That offence arose from daily supplies of heroin by the applicant to Caccamo over a period of about three weeks and involved 119 grams of the drug. It will be recalled that the s 25(2) offence involved about 394 grams, so the Form 1 matter would necessarily have had a significant impact upon the sentence imposed for that offence in order to reflect the increased need for retribution. 
     
      
    18 Ultimately the question for resolution is whether the starting point chosen by the Judge for the s 25(2) offence was excessive bearing in mind the Form 1 matters and in particular the supply offence. I do not believe it was. The Judge found that the applicant was in the business of supplying drugs substantially as a means of making a living. His Honour could not make an assessment of how profitable that business was but accepted it was his sole source of income. The applicant was clearly selling as a wholesaler at least so far as Caccamo was concerned. In my opinion a starting sentence of ten years and six months as against a head sentence of 20 years was well within range notwithstanding that the amount of heroin supplied was at the lower end of the commercial quantity. At the end of the day it seems to me to be impossible to find that a head sentence of six years and eight months and a non-parole period of five years was manifestly excessive. Any lesser sentence would have infringed s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion the first ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    20 The next ground of appeal concerns the relationship between the overall head sentence and the overall minimum period of custody that the applicant has to serve before being eligible for release to parole. The overall non-parole period is 80 per cent of the overall term of imprisonment whereas the statutory proportion under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is 75 per cent. Of course there is no prohibition on the proportion of the non-parole period to the term of the sentence exceeding 75 per cent and a judge is not required to give reasons for exceeding the statutory relationship. There is nothing in the section that constrains the discretion of a sentencing judge in relation to setting a non-parole period unless the ratio is to fall below 75 per cent in which case the judge must find special circumstances justifying that result: R v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376, a case in which the non-parole period exceeded the statutory proportion under legislation then operating. 
     
      
    21 However, it is submitted that this was not an intended result and arose because of the partial accumulation between the sentences for the two offences and, what is said to be, the Judge’s failure to find special circumstances in order to retain the statutory relationship. The relevant part of the Judge’s sentencing remarks are as follows (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
         
        It was urged on behalf of the offender that his alleged addiction, or former addiction to cocaine, should ground a finding of special circumstances in addition to other reasons for a finding of special circumstances. I do not accept that submission. Even if the offender was previously addicted to cocaine, it is clear from [the counsellor’s] report he has been able to keep of[f] drugs since being in gaol. He has been in gaol now since 1 October 2001. He will, in any event, have a lengthy period at large upon his release on parole so that any residual inclination he has towards beginning to take drugs again at that time can be addressed during that period.  
        I accept that in some cases it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances where two or more offences are imposed to be served concurrently. However the sentences that I am going to impose have been structured so that the minimum, appropriate period for accumulative sentences, or overlapping of sentences, will be served and it is not necessary for me to address that problem by making a finding of special circumstances. I do not think that any lesser period of non parole is appropriate for these offences than the ones I am going to specify. 
        
       
      
    22 With great respect, the passage underlined is not a model of clarity of expression and there are obvious mistakes or transcription errors. The word “offences” in the first underline sentence should be “sentences” and the word “concurrently” at the end of that sentence should be read as “consecutively” otherwise the sentence does not make any sense. There is also a disconformity between the use of the singular “lesser period of non parole” and the use of the plural in the expression “the ones” in the last sentence of that passage. But it is clear that the Judge was aware that, when making sentences cumulative or partly cumulative, it might be necessary to find special circumstances in order to ensure that the statutory proportion between the overall term and the overall non-parole period is preserved. That was the whole point of the first underlined sentence. I take his Honour to be indicating in the second and third underlined sentences that in the present case he did not intend to take that course because he believed that the resulting overall non-parole period was the least minimum period that the applicant should serve for the purpose of reflecting the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    23 Contrary to the argument of Senior Counsel for the applicant, it seems to me that the Judge was well aware of what he was doing and the outcome of the orders he was making. The fact that the overall non-parole period exceeds the statutory relationship is not a basis for this Court overturning what was a discretionary decision by the Judge on the facts and circumstances of this particular case unless it clearly was not open to the judge to come to that decision. In the present case, in light of the seriousness of the offending, the subjective matters of the applicant were not of such significance that I would conclude that the Judge erred by failing to impose a lesser period of custody to be served before the applicant can be eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion the second ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    25 The third ground of appeal in effect asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from sentences imposed upon two persons who are described in the submissions of the applicant as “co-offenders”. The applicant relies upon the sentences imposed upon Anthony Markarian and Caccamo. 
     
      
    26 Markarian was charged with knowingly being concerned in the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin. The amount was 415 grams. He also asked the sentencing judge, who was Hosking DCJ, to take into account a number of matters on a Form 1. He was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months with a non-parole period of fifteen months. The Crown appealed against that sentence and this Court upheld the appeal and sentenced Markarian to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of four years and six months. The High Court, however, found that this Court had erred in the manner in which it approached the resolution of the Crown appeal, set aside the sentence and remitted the matter to this Court: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048. On 3 August 2005 this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, dismissed the Crown appeal. Brownie AJA, who gave the principal judgment, considered that the sentence was manifestly inadequate: R v Markarian [2005] NSWCCA 264. 
     
      
    27 The facts upon which Markarian was sentenced and his subjective factors were summarised in the joint judgment of the High Court as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [6] The facts constituting the principal offence consisted of the appellant's acting over a period of 5 months as a driver for Vincent Caccamo, a dealer in heroin. The appellant, who was himself a heroin addict, was paid in heroin for his services. The material before the sentencing court emphasized the different degree of criminality of the appellant from Caccamo's. Caccamo had previously been sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years for a number of offences of supply in the course of an illicit business of handling and selling drugs. The relative brevity in all of the circumstances of his sentence is explained by the significant value that the judge who sentenced him attached to his cooperation with the police. Another of Caccamo's drivers, Chung, was sentenced to periodic detention of 3 years with a 2 years period of non-parole. Chung did not have a criminal record. He had fewer other matters to be taken into account, and he had driven less frequently for Caccamo than had the appellant.  
         
         
        [7] The appellant gave evidence at the sentence hearing. This, in summary, was that he was born in December 1963 and started to use heroin soon after his mother's death in August 1996. Caccamo became his source for the drug. In April 1998, he was sent to prison. By the time of his release in October 1999 he had taken himself off both heroin and methadone. He however resumed contact with Caccamo in about July 2000. He regarded himself as indebted to Caccamo for the latter's kindness to his father when he was in prison. At this point the appellant resumed drug taking. Caccamo, who did not have a valid driver's licence, used the appellant as his driver in return for drugs. Before he was charged the appellant had dissipated, largely on illegal drugs, an inheritance from his father of $200,000. He claimed that his own criminal activities had been done out of desperation and in despair at the loss of his parents. 
         
          
         
        [8] The appellant has a criminal history. He was placed on recognisance of 3 years for cultivating a prohibited plant and fined for possessing a prohibited imported drug in 1991. In May 1998 he was sentenced to imprisonment for supplying a prohibited drug. For that offence he spent 18 months in prison and an additional 18 months on parole. He was on parole at the time of the commission of the principal offence and one of the further offences.  
         
         
        [9] The sentencing judge had before him an optimistic pre-sentence report indicating that the appellant had been in regular employment until about 1990. He had apparently made genuine progress towards drug rehabilitation by the time of sentence. 
         
        
       
      
    28 Caccamo was sentenced for three offences of supplying drugs. The first was an offence of supplying between 9 April 2000 and 6 September 2000 not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, being 1.22 kilograms. In respect of that offence three matters were taken into account. The second offence was 1.28 kilograms of cannabis. The third offence was supplying between 1 January 1999 and 6 May 1999 not less than a commercial quantity of heroin, being 966 grams. After receiving a discount of 46.6 per cent for his plea and assistance to the authorities, Caccamo was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on the first offence with a non-parole period of five years. The sentences for the other offences were made concurrent. An appeal by Caccamo against that sentence was dismissed by this Court: R v Caccamo [2005] NSWCCA 257. 
     
      
    29 The complaint is that the applicant feels aggrieved because his sentence is longer than those imposed upon both Markarian and Caccamo yet his criminality was less than Caccamo and, although greater than Markarian, was not such that could justify the difference in their sentences. 
     
      
    30 There may be some question as to whether Markarian or Caccamo were co-offenders with the applicant. There is no common offence between them. In R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 28 this Court considered that the principle of parity did not apply where the two offenders were not co-offenders in respect of any of the offences for which they were to be sentenced even though “there was some association between the two offenders and some overlap in their activities”. 
     
      
    31 In Araya Johnson J, who gave the leading judgment, quoted with approval remarks I made in R v Singh [2001] NSWCCA 424. In those remarks I stated that the applicant “was not a co-offender of any person other than the unidentified person or persons who supplied him with the drugs that he on-supplied to the operative.” I must confess to now having doubts as to whether the supplier and purchaser of drugs should be considered as co-offenders. However, the Crown conceded that, although the applicant, Markarian and Caccamo were not technically co-offenders, the Court should have regard to the sentences imposed upon the latter two offenders as a matter of fairness to the applicant. I am prepared to act on that basis although I have some doubts about its appropriateness. However, I should note that Caccamo was not the only purchaser who obtained drugs from the applicant and there were at least ten other purchasers involved in the s 25A offence. 
     
      
    32 It is clear that the criminality of Markarian was less than that of the applicant, and Mr Byrne conceded as much. Further the subjective features were very different from those of the applicant, even if some of them might have been to Markarian’s disadvantage. This Court has twice considered that Markarian’s sentence was manifestly inadequate. This Court is not required to exercise its discretion to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence by reason of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender that is inadequate; R v Diamond (NSWCCA, unreported, 19 February 1993; R v LLM [2005] NSWCCA 302. The fact that Markarian “escaped” the imposition of an appropriate sentence by reason of an error of this Court initially and the exercise of discretion ultimately does not in my opinion give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance that this Court should address. If R v Hodges (1997) 95 A Crim R 85 suggests otherwise, I would not be prepared to follow it, but the facts of that case are clearly distinguishable from this. 
     
      
    33 In so far as Caccamo is concerned, the applicant was clearly at a higher point in the drug hierarchy than was Caccamo. Although the Judge seemed to have been reluctant to embrace a submission by the Crown to that effect, with respect I simply do not understand his Honour’s line of reasoning for not making that finding. The Judge seemed to think that it was a relevant consideration that Caccamo might also have obtained heroin from persons other than the applicant. But Mr Byrne SC accepted that logic and reason must lead to the conclusion that the applicant was nearer the source of the drug because he could sell it to Caccamo and others at a profit. Mr Byrne also accepted that the applicant could be considered as a wholesaler whereas Caccamo was a retailer. Notwithstanding that the amount supplied by Caccamo was greater than that supplied by the applicant, the applicant’s criminality could be considered greater because of his position in the hierarchy. There was also a greater degree of assistance given by Caccamo that justified a greater reduction in the sentence. The Judge in the present matter seemed to feel that he might have been overly generous to the applicant in the discount he gave. 
     
      
    34 I am not persuaded that this Court should exercise its discretion to intervene in order to ease some sense of grievance or unfairness that the applicant might feel about his sentence when compared with that of Caccamo. Therefore the third ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    35 I propose that the extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal be granted, that leave to appeal also be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    36 LATHAM J: I agree with Howie J.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 MASON P: The claimant seeks declaratory and other relief effectively to quash the decision and orders made by a Commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission on the basis that the Commission disregarded the mandate of s500(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. That provision is one of several dealing with the consequences of the winding up of the company. It states: 
     
      
       
        
         
         After the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up, no action or other civil proceeding is to be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.  
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    2 In this provision “Court” is defined to include the Federal Court and the Supreme Court but does not extend to the Commission itself (see Corporations Act, s58AA). 
     
      
       
      
    3 Barrett J has held that s500(2) applies to a creditor’s voluntary winding up but not to a member’s winding up (see Awada v Linknarf Ltd (in liq) (2002) 55 NSWLR 745 (see also Catto v Hampton Australia Limited (1998) 20 ACSR 225). 
     
      
       
      
    4 Mr Brian Randall was employed as a tourist coach driver by Downtown Limousines Pty Limited (the company). His services were terminated on 9 September 2002. Proceedings were commenced in the Commission on behalf of the employee by the Transport Workers Union of Australia New South Wales branch, seeking relief pursuant to Pt 6, Unfair Dismissals, of Ch 2, Employment, of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. The hearing commenced before Commissioner Connor on 12 June 2003. Early in the proceedings it was indicated that compensation was sought in lieu of reinstatement.  
     
      
       
      
    5 On the first day of the hearing evidence was given by the claimant, Mr Mark Phillip Hertz. There was cross-examination. The cross-examination was incomplete. The proceedings were stood over for further hearing on 21 July 2003. At the adjourned hearing counsel previously representing the company, Mr Patterson, informed the Commission as a matter of courtesy that the company had been placed into voluntary liquidation the previous Friday, 18 July 2003. It is unnecessary to go into the details of what happened. A question was raised about his retainer. Mr Patterson was not permitted to develop the situation. His attendance was excused.  
     
      
       
      
    6 Commissioner Connor ruled that he was not satisfied that the Corporations Act imposed an obligation to stay the proceedings. It is unnecessary to look in any detail about his reasoning, but it did include uncertainty on the information he had been provided by Mr Hatcher, who was representing the Union, about whether or not the liquidation had actually and properly commenced.  
     
      
       
      
    7 The opponents joined in these proceedings are the Commission and the Union, each of which has submitted to the orders of the Court, save as to costs. Neither Mr Randall nor the company, nor its liquidator, if it is truly in liquidation, were joined as parties to these proceedings.  
     
      
       
      
    8 Mr Van Aalst, representing the claimant, has informed the Court that on his instructions Mr Randall and the company were notified of these proceedings in that they were served with copies of some of the process. To my mind that does not make them parties to the proceedings, nor operate as an invitation to become parties, or otherwise satisfy the mandate of the requirements of procedural fairness if it applies in the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    9 As indicated, the proceedings in the Commission were adjourned part heard from 12 June to 21 July 2003. The Commissioner ruled in effect that he did not consider that he was required to desist from further hearing the proceedings by virtue of the Corporations Act. He received a small amount of additional evidence. There was no continuation of the cross-examination of the claimant, who was not represented on the adjourned hearing date. The claimant swore an affidavit in these proceedings stating to the effect that he did not attend on advice, because that advice was to the effect that the proceedings were stayed and would not continue on 21 July. 
     
      
       
      
    10 The Commissioner has published a document called a Decision. It is dated 21 July 2003, although it would appear, and I infer, it was promulgated some time later; 21 July was the date when the hearing was completed. At the end of that hearing the Commissioner indicated the orders he was minded to make. He also indicated he would be reserving to consider his reasons. The document called “Decision”, which is at p 5 of the combined book, appears to be a composite of the reasons and the formal orders constituting the conclusion of the application being made by the Union on Mr Randall’s behalf for compensation for unfair dismissal. The orders were: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         (1) Okopny Pty Limited  
         [the new name of Downtown Limousines Pty Limited] 
          shall pay the sum of $20,500 to Mr Brian Randall within 21 days. 
          
          
         (2) This order shall take effect on and from Monday 21 July 2003. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    11 There is evidence in the combined book that Mr Randall has sought to enforce this money judgment. It seems clear to me that he has an interest in retaining the order, notwithstanding the fact that it would appear that the company is hopelessly insolvent. For one thing, the order clarifies the quantum and the entitlement and it means that the question of the proof of debt in the insolvent liquidation, if there is a liquidation in place, is beyond further dispute, or would appear to be so. 
     
      
       
      
    12 When the matter was called on for hearing Mr Van Aalst, who represents the claimant, was questioned about some of a number of issues that would appear to arise in the proceedings. As I have indicated, the summons seeks by declaratory and other forms of relief to quash the decision on the basis that the Commissioner disregarded the mandate of s 500(2) of the Corporations Act.  
     
      
       
      
    13 When the Court pointed out that it was concerned about the absence of Mr Randall and the company and/or its liquidator as parties in these proceedings, we were informed, as I have indicated, that there had been some notification to at least some of them, but it was clarified that they had not been made parties to these proceedings. This, it seems to me, is an insurmountable difficulty with the matter proceeding today, and it is one that in effect Mr Van Aalst has indicated he is not in a position to remedy today, although he seeks to proceed today. 
     
      
       
      
    14 There is an additional problem that in my view justifies the dismissal of the proceedings. Even if the proceedings were properly constituted, there is the question of the utility of granting the relief that is sought by the claimant. The claimant was not a party to the proceedings in the Commission, he was a witness. His concern - using that in a lay sense - has arisen out of the fact that he has quite recently been charged with offences under ss317 and 327 of the Crimes Act 1900. The factual basis of those charges, according to the matters alleged, is that Mr Hertz either fabricated false evidence with intent to mislead the Commission (that being the s317 charge) or committed perjury contrary to s327. The particulars of the charges indicate that the conduct forming the basis of these allegations relates to steps taken in relation to the evidence filed on his behalf in his witness statement and evidence that he gave in his sworn testimony on 12 June 2003 before the proceedings were adjourned. No part of the material sought to be ventilated in the criminal proceedings relates to what happened on 21 July 2003 in the absence of the claimant.  
     
      
       
      
    15 Counsel for the claimant accepts that it is s327 on which he relies in an endeavour to show the materiality and utility of this Court granting the relief that is sought. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         327 
           
         Offence of perjury 
          
         (1) Any person who in or in connection with any judicial proceeding makes any false statement on oath concerning any matter which is material to the proceeding, knowing the statement to be false or not believing it to be true, is guilty of perjury and liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
          
         (2) A statement can be considered to have been made in connection with a judicial proceeding whether or not a judicial proceeding has commenced, or ever commences, in connection with it. 
          
         (3) The determination of whether a statement is material to a judicial proceeding that has not commenced is to be made on the basis of any judicial proceeding likely to arise in connection with the statement. 
          
         (4) The question of whether any matter is material to a proceeding is a question of law. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    16 This is not an appropriate forum in which to be making rulings any more broadly than is necessary, and in particular in which to make rulings that could in some way set the legal parameters for the criminal proceedings that have just been commenced. Since, however, the claimant must satisfy us that there is any utility in the relief that he seeks, it is sufficient to say that I am entirely unpersuaded that the making of the orders that are sought in the summons would in any way advance the position of the claimant as a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Putting it around the other way, there is simply no utility in making the orders that are sought that would suggest that the claimant has a real interest in, or would gain anything by the making of those orders. As I have indicated, the charges relate to events that occurred prior to 21 July 2003 and also prior to 18 July 2003 when, taking matters at the highest, s500(2) of the Corporations Act may have impacted on the pending proceedings in the Commission. 
     
      
       
      
    17 I am entirely unpersuaded that anything in s327 requires the relevant judicial proceeding to have come to an end, let alone come to a lawful end, before the offence of perjury can be established. The question of materiality of the allegedly false statement will be a matter for the prosecution, but that is not in any way impacted upon by leaving standing the transcript of 21 July 2003 or the Commissioner’s decision. That decision will not be evidence in any criminal proceedings and nothing we have been shown would indicate that anything happened on 21 July 2003 that goes to the materiality of the evidence previously given and said to have been false in the criminal charge. 
     
      
       
      
    18 It is unnecessary to do more than note that it may well also be open to the accused in the criminal proceedings to raise these issues by way of defence. 
     
      
       
      
    19 The two matters I have referred to seem to me to make these present proceedings hopeless, and there is no utility in them, nor any point in continuing with the other issues or even contemplating any adjournment - not that it has been sought - to overcome the natural justice issue that I have already referred to. It is also unnecessary, in the circumstances, to do more than note that there are additional clouds on the horizon as to whether a creditor’s voluntary liquidation had commenced on 18 July and as to whether s179 of the Industrial Relations Act creates difficulties in this Court granting the relief that is sought.  
     
      
       
      
    20 For those reasons I propose that the summons be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    21 MCCOLL JA: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    22 BASTEN JA: I agree with the President.

     Gregory Allan MAGRIN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 16 August 2004 the appellant, Gregory Magrin, stood trial before Judge Ellis and a jury at Parramatta District Court on an indictment containing the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1: That, on or about 25 December 2002 at Fairfield in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with [LH], a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 6 years (Crimes Act s 61A). 
         
         
        Count 2: [in the alternative to Count 1] That on or about 25 December 2002 in Fairfield in the State of New South Wales, he did assault [LH] and at the time of that assault did commit an act of indecency on [LH], a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 6 years (Crimes Act s 61M(2)). 
        
       
      
    3 A verdict of guilty in relation to Count 1 was returned on 25 August 2004 and, as a result, it was unnecessary to take a verdict in relation to Count 2. On 16 December 2004 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his conviction and there is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. There was a single ground of appeal argued before the Court being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination of the appellant in relation to the evidence of alibi. 
        
       
       
      There were originally two grounds of appeal filed but the second ground, relating to directions given by the trial judge, was abandoned at the outset of the hearing. The remaining ground of appeal changed in complexion somewhat during the course of oral argument and ultimately has more to do with the appellant’s right to silence and a purported shift in the onus of proof than to any issue relating to alibi. 
       
       
      The Crown case 
      
    5 The case relied upon by the Crown can be stated briefly. In July 1992 the complainant’s father, Mr H, moved to a house in Smithfield with his three sons, LH (the complainant, then aged 6), JH (then aged 7) and NH (then aged 16). In August 1992 the family became acquainted with the appellant through a neighbour. The appellant, known as “Lenny”, lived about ten minutes’ drive away in Villawood. The appellant shared his house with two brothers, Robert and Rodney Smith. 
     
      
    6 At about 10am on 24 December 2002, at the request of Mr H, the appellant and Rodney Smith came to the Smithfield house to collect the two youngest children in order to mind them while Mr H and his eldest son did some last minute Christmas shopping. When he returned at some time between 2 and 3pm, Mr H called the appellant to arrange for the boys to be brought home. He spoke to the boys and they asked if they could stay at the appellant’s house overnight because they were having fun. They had not stayed overnight there before. Mr H then spoke with the appellant and it was agreed that the boys could stay for the night. 
     
      
    7 The following day, Christmas Day, the appellant and Rodney Smith brought the boys back to the Smithfield house at 11am and stayed for Christmas lunch. At about 4.30pm, when the appellant was leaving, the complainant asked his father if he could again stay the night at the appellant’s house. It was agreed that he could. On this occasion the complainant went alone with the appellant and Rodney Smith. 
     
      
    8 It was the Crown’s case that on the night of 25 December the appellant sexually assaulted the complainant. The complainant’s account was that he was with the appellant in his bedroom watching television. The appellant asked him to come over and sit on his lap. In the recorded police interview played in evidence to the jury the complainant said that the appellant forced him to sit on his lap and “he sticked his willy up my bum… about four times”. The complainant also said that later that night Rodney forced him to drink beer, bourbon and cordial. 
     
      
    9 Later that evening the complainant spoke to his father on the telephone in the appellant’s bedroom. The complainant said that he had wanted to tell his father about what had happened to him but he found it too difficult because the appellant was in the bedroom with him. 
     
      
    10 The next day the appellant took the complainant home. The complainant did not say anything about the sexual assault to his father. In the following days the complainant told his father that his “poo” was very hard to get out and his “bum” was sore. 
     
      
    11 On 5 January 2003, when the complainant was watching television with his brothers and father, he said to his father, “Daddy do you remember when I stayed at Lenny’s place on Christmas night… Well Lenny asked me to sit on his knee and he touched my willy and he put his willy up my bum”. Later that afternoon the complainant’s father spoke to a neighbour about whether he should report the incident to the police. Mr Hook replied “Well it’s [the complainant’s] word against Lenny’s”. 
     
      
    12 On 11 January 2003 the appellant visited the complainant’s home. At one point the complainant and his brother JH were sitting in the lounge room staring at the appellant and Mr H asked them to go to their bedroom. He did not raise the complainant’s allegation with the appellant. However, on 6 February 2003 a complaint was made to the police. On 6 March 2003 the police interviewed the complainant. 
     
      
    13 On 17 March 2003 Dr Brennan examined the complainant. She took a history from him similar to the account given during the interview with police. Dr Brennan also examined the complainant and found an abnormality of the anus, being a break in the skin that was beginning to heal. The doctor gave evidence that the cause of the abnormality was likely to be either severe constipation or an object such as a male penis entering the anus and exceeding the normal parameters of the anus. She said that the extent of healing of the injury was not inconsistent with the injury having been caused on 25 December 2002. She also said that the symptoms following a sexual assault would include a “sore bottom”, constipation through anxiety, and, depending on the depth of the injury, maybe some bleeding. When she was taking the history from the complainant, he said that, after the appellant had assaulted him, there was blood on his, the complainant’s, pants. He had not shown them to his father but rather put them in the washing machine. 
     
      
    14 The appellant was arrested on 8 September 2003 and declined to be interviewed. Police made unsuccessful attempts to locate Rodney and Robert Smith and at the time of the trial there were warrants in existence for their arrest. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
      
    15 The appellant gave evidence at the trial. His version of the events on 24 December was similar to that given by Mr H and there is no need to repeat it. He said that he did not stay at home that night to mind the boys but instead went to Smithfield RSL Club at about 6 pm. When he left the house, the boys were out the back feeding the animals and Rodney and Robert Smith were in the house. At the RSL Club he met Deirdre Hanson, a person he had known for over 20 years. He was godfather to her two children. He stayed with her at the RSL Club until 1am and then went back to her place where he stayed the night. Ms Hanson drove him home in the early morning. 
     
      
    16 At around 10am on Christmas day the appellant and Rodney Smith took the boys back to the Smithfield house and stayed there for lunch. He went home with the complainant and Rodney Smith a little after 4pm.  
     
      
    17 The appellant’s evidence was that he stayed at the Villawood house until about 7.30pm and then went out. Rodney and Robert Smith offered to look after the complainant. He went to the Cabravale Diggers Club at Canley Vale for about an hour and a half before going into town. He returned home at about 8am to find the complainant asleep on his bed. He and Rodney Smith took the complainant home at about 11am. In cross-examination the appellant said that, while he was out that night he had met a few people he knew. He said he spent two hours with Deirdre Hanson at the Mount Pritchard Community Club. 
     
      
    18 Deirdre Hanson gave evidence that she met the appellant on 24 December at the Smithfield RSL at about 7pm. They stayed there until the end of the karaoke, and then went back to her place together so that he could see his godchildren. They arrived at her home at about 2am and continued drinking until the early hours of the morning. When the children woke up, they opened their Christmas presents together and then she drove the appellant home about 7.30am. 
     
      
    19 Ms Hanson gave evidence that she saw the appellant at about 1 to 2pm on Christmas day at the Mount Pritchard Community Club. They were together there for a couple of hours before taking the children to Strathfield station to see their father. It took about an hour to drive from the Club to Strathfield and the children were dropped off there at about 4pm. It might be noted that this version of events was inconsistent with the version given by the appellant that he was at the complainant’s house having Christmas lunch until after 4 pm. 
     
      
    20 Ms Hanson also gave evidence that later that evening she spoke with the appellant on the telephone to let him know that she had dropped the children off safely. She was not sure what time it was when she called but she could hear music and other voices in the background. She saw the appellant again on 26 December between 7 and 8am when she called at his house to borrow some money. 
     
      
    21 The defence case did not dispute that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. Implicit in the alibi evidence, however, was the contention that the complainant had been assaulted by one of the Smith brothers. To that end there was some cross-examination of the complainant concerning a description he gave the police of the person who had assaulted him, even though he named the person as “Lenny”, the appellant. This cross-examination was largely based on the apparent inconsistency between the description he gave to police of the facial hair of his attacker and the facial hair of the appellant at the time. It was suggested that he was describing one of the Smith brothers rather than the appellant. It was never put directly to the complainant that he was mistaken as to the person who assaulted him. The complainant’s evidence was that he knew Rodney Smith, who had given him “drugs, beer, bourbon, cordial” but he did not know any one called Robert. 
     
      
    22 During his address defence counsel said little on the issue of mistaken identity. The only reference to it occurs in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It’s a possible explanation if you were satisfied – if you were satisfied – that this act of anal intercourse had happened, that it happened on 25 December 2002, but it might not be the accused. You of course are not called upon to decide whether Rodney did or did not do it if you are satisfied that it did happen. You are only called upon to decide whether the Crown has proved its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
      A telephone call on Christmas night 
      
    23 During the trial there was somewhat contradictory evidence regarding a telephone call on Christmas night during which the complainant spoke with his father. The complainant told the police during a recorded interview that he was with the appellant in the appellant’s bedroom when he placed a call to his father. 
     
      
    24 The complainant’s father gave evidence that, before the complainant left with the appellant and Rodney Smith on Christmas night, he told the complainant that he would telephone him at about 8pm that night, before his bedtime, which was at 8.30. He gave evidence that he spoke with the appellant on the telephone when he rang to speak with his son that evening. In his statement to the police the father stated that the complainant rang him at 8pm on Christmas night but his evidence at the trial was that it was he who had placed the call to the appellant’s house. He was not sure whether there had been a second call when the complainant had telephoned him. 
     
      
    25 Police investigations revealed that there was no record of any phone call being made from the appellant’s phone number to the residence of the complainant’s family at 8pm on Christmas day. There was, however, a record of one outgoing call to the complainant’s home at 2.15pm during the period between 23 and 27 December. 
     
      
    26 The ground of appeal centres upon cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: In the evening of Christmas Day I want to put it to you that you never went out? 
         
         
        A. Yes I did. 
         
         
        Q. Do you remember talking to MH on the telephone in the evening hours of Christmas day? 
         
         
        A. In the afternoon. 
         
         
        Q. No, in the evening hours around 8 o’clock? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. I want to suggest to you that he rang up and spoke to L? 
         
         
        A. The phone number was left at home on the table – on the bedroom table or – for the brothers to get the boys to ring their father if they have to. 
         
         
        Q. I want to suggest that Mr H spoke to you about 8 o’clock? 
         
         
        A. Spoke to me at 8 o’clock? 
         
         
        Q. On Christmas day, 8 o’clock in the evening? 
         
         
        A. Not that I recall. 
         
         
        Q. Could it have happened, could he have spoken to you, if you – so you say you don’t recall? 
         
         
        A. He may have spoken to one of the brothers. 
         
         
        Q. See the brothers aren’t here, are they? 
         
         
        A. No, but they should be. 
         
         
        Q. Are you saying that because you know they’re not here? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. See, it’s easy to blame them, isn’t it? 
         
         
        A. The thing is they lived at my place –  
         
         
        Q. Just answer the questions, it’s easy to blame them when they’re not here? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Objection. Relevance. Objection. Pressed. Question AlloweD 
         
         
        Q. See when they’re not here it’s easy to blame them or implicate them by saying “Oh they should be here”, isn’t it? 
         
         
        A. Well there’s been an investigation to find out where they are, I’m just wondering why they ain’t here as well. 
         
         
        Q. Well you were asked by the police weren’t you? 
         
         
        A. Well of course. 
         
         
        Q. Exercising the right that you have you declined to talk to them? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Do you know where they are? 
         
         
        A. If I knew where they are I’d be getting me money off them what they owe me. 
         
         
        Q. When is the last time you had any contact with them? 
         
         
        A. When I kicked them out in April sometime. 
         
         
        Q. April 2003? 
         
         
        A. Yeah round about there. 
         
        
       
      
    27 During the Crown Prosecutor’s address the following was said in relation to that part of the cross-examination quoted above: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He called evidence from Deirdre Hanson and as you’re aware she said that on Christmas night that she’d given him a phone call. In reality that’s his alibi evidence, that phone call. Now I’ll deal with her evidence in a little while. Of course in cross-examination he talked about the two brothers and unfortunately how they weren’t at this trial. Now in relation to that we know that as soon as the police became aware of Rodney they’ve made checks, they’ve tried to find him and they haven’t been able to find him. There are two first instant warrants out for his arrest. Robert, they weren’t able to get a more accurate description of Robert such as his birth date, and weren’t able to do any checks. We do know that they approached the accused and again, as is his right, he didn’t want to speak to police about it. The next piece of evidence comes when the accused is in the witness box and it says: 
         
         
        Q. Well the brothers aren’t here, are they? 
         
         
        ---this is on page 16--- 
         
         
        A. No, but they should be. 
         
         
        Q. Are you saying that because you know they’re not here? 
         
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. See, it’s easy to blame them, isn’t it? 
         
         
        A. The thing is they lived at my place –  
         
         
        Well it’s a proposition that may well be put forward to you, that the brothers did it, and as I said it’s very convenient to blame them when they can’t be found, when they’re not around, and if you believe the accused he says that he wanted them to be found, that they owed him money. He says, again on page 16 at line 30: 
         
         
        Q. Do you know where they are? 
         
         
        A. If I knew where they are I’d be getting my money out of them that they owe. 
         
         
        Q. When is the last time that you had any contact with them? 
         
         
        A. When I kicked them out in April some time. 
         
         
        Q. April 2003? 
         
         
        A. Yeah, around about there. 
         
         
        Certainly it doesn’t appear that despite the fact of being owed any money he was able to shed any light on where they are. 
         
        
       
      
    28 It was argued on behalf of the applicant that the passage from the cross-examination of the appellant quoted above had the tendency to introduce a reversal of the onus of proof into the jury’s mind by suggesting that the appellant should have ensured that the brothers were present and that he was fabricating a defence in their absence. Reliance was placed upon the fact that this was a case of mistaken identity arising from the cross-examination of the complainant about the facial hair of the person who assaulted him and what he had told police in his interview with them. The Court was taken to passages in the judgments of the High Court in Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285 as to the absence of witnesses and Maiden and Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 on the right to silence.  
     
      
    29 It should be noted that the cross-examination arose in respect of the answer given by the appellant to questioning about whether he had spoken to the complainant’s father at about 8pm on Christmas night. If he had, of course, this would have been contrary to his alibi. The applicant had first responded “not that I recall’ which led the Crown to challenge that answer because it contained an implied concession that he might have done so. The applicant then asserted that the father might have spoken to one of the Smith brothers rather than to him. It was this answer that led the Crown to put to him that it was easy for the appellant to blame the Smith brothers because he knew they were not at court. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion the Crown was challenging the applicant’s credit arising from the answer he gave to the question about the phone call to the complainant rather than attempting to improperly imply any breach of some onus on the part of the appellant to lead evidence in support of his alibi. I am prepared to accept that the Crown should have stayed clear of the area of the refusal of the appellant to answer questions to the police about the whereabouts of the Smith brothers as this could so easily lead to a line of reasoning on the part of the jury inconsistent with an accused’s right to silence. But I do not believe that the cross-examination alone raised any improper suggestion that the appellant had some duty to have the witnesses present such that it carried with it a real risk that the jury might have misplaced the onus of proof in that regard. 
     
      
    31 It should be noted that, although defence counsel did object to one of the questions asked by the Crown on the basis of relevance, he did not object to the Crown straying into the area of the appellant’s failure to answer questions by the police or raise any other complaint about the cross-examination either during its course or at its conclusion. 
     
      
    32 Mr Smith, who appeared for the appellant before this Court, relied upon the section of the Crown’s address relating to this cross-examination and quoted above as raising again with the jury the suggestion, even if obliquely, that the appellant had some duty in relation to the presentation of the Smith brothers at court and that he had failed in that obligation by failing to assist the police to find them. After referring to the appellant’s answers in relation to the whereabouts of the Smith brothers and his inability to locate them the Crown said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Certainly it doesn’t appear that despite the fact of being owed any money he was able to shed any light on where they are. 
         
        
       
      
    33 I believe that there is more substance in this complainant. I do not understand the import of the last sentence of the passage of the address quoted above if it were not to raise a suggestion of some failure on the part of the appellant to be able to assist in the finding of the Smith brothers and having them at court. The fact that the appellant could or could not shed any light on the whereabouts of the Smith brothers was irrelevant at best and at worst might have led the jury to misplace the onus of proof in that regard. 
     
      
    34 But in my opinion the jury could have not been misled into an improper line of reasoning by the cross-examination even in the light of the Crown Prosecutor’s address because of what the judge had told the jury about his right of silence during the trial and what he said to the jury in that regard during his summing up. Again it should be noted that there was no complainant about the address by defence counsel at the trial. 
     
      
    35 The police officer who had sought to speak to the appellant about the Smith brothers gave evidence that the appellant had refused to say anything to him without first speaking to his solicitor. The Judge then immediately said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ladies and gentlemen, the same thing applies that I said before in terms of the right to silence. Any time a police officer speaks to a person accused, they have a right to remain silent and or obtain some legal advice first. You should not draw any adverse inference against the accused for so doing. 
        
       
       
      This direction was given in the light of a much fuller and more emphatic direction given to the jury on the first occasion that the jury were informed that the appellant had refused to answer questions by the police in respect of the allegation made by the complainant. 
       
      
    36 During cross-examination of this police officer it was made perfectly clear to the jury that the police officer expected that, where a person had received legal advice not to speak to the police, he would expect the person to follow that advice, that the refusal was the exercise “of a perfectly legitimate legal right” and that it occurred the majority of the time. 
     
      
    37 The summing up contained ample directions on the onus of proof generally and in relation to the alibi in particular. It was made clear to the jury that before they could convict the accused they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant told them the truth “which will involve rejection of the accused and a rejection perhaps of the alibi of Ms Hanson, depending upon what you make of that telephone call and its timing…”. The jury were informed of the impact of delay in complaint upon the ability of the appellant to defend himself and how that delay had resulted in the inability to locate the Smith brothers and deprived the appellant of the opportunity to investigate the circumstances of the allegation and to speak to the Smith brothers at a time when they might have had a good recollection of the events. 
     
      
    38 The trial was conducted on the basis that the police had made every endeavour to find the Smith brothers without success. The trial judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is not as if it could be said that it is the accused’s fault that those men are not here because the police have got warrants out there trying to get those men here too. 
        
       
      
    39 No further directions were sought on this topic by defence counsel. It must be taken that either he did not appreciate the sting in the Crown’s address that has been identified in this court as he listened to it, or, if he did, that he believed in the light of the directions given throughout the trial and in the summing up that there was no chance that the jury might use the absence of the Smith brothers to the appellant’s disadvantage. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion there is no reason why rule 4 of the Criminal Rules should not apply notwithstanding the objection by the defence counsel to part of the cross-examination. If defence counsel believed that the cross examination was improper it was not sufficient simply to object to one question on the grounds of irrelevance and then make no other objection or complaint simply because that objection had been overruled. In any event I am satisfied that in light of the directions given by the trial judge there was no risk of the jury using the cross-examination or the Crown’s reference to it during the address to misplace the onus of proof in regard to the failure of the Smith brothers to appear or to use that fact in any other way against the accused or his defence. 
     
      
    41 I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    42 HOEBEN J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of soliciting to murder contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2 The proposed victims were Myra Linda Oswald, the appellant’s former partner with whom he had a young daughter and Glenn Wakeham who was in a relationship with Ms Oswald at the time the solicitation occurred. 
     
      
    3 Following his conviction the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 8 months to commence on 8 May 2000 and expire on 7 January 2007 with a non-parole period of 5 years, to expire on 7 May 2005. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
     
      
    5 At various stages in the proceedings the appellant has appeared for himself. This was true in the early stages of the preparation of this appeal although at the hearing he was represented by counsel. Prior to the hearing, the appellant filed written submissions which he personally prepared, which have been supplemented by a number of other written documents. At the hearing, counsel on his behalf advanced limited oral argument but after confirming his instructions indicated that the appellant wished to rely upon all of the written material that had been placed before the Court. Further written material has been received since the oral hearings. Much of the material is repetitive and some is difficult to understand. These reasons analyse the submissions as I understand them. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    6 The Crown case was comprised of a history of the appellant’s life with his former wife and conversations in Australia with various people, some of which were recorded. The appellant had been living in a de facto relationship with Ms Oswald, and they had a young daughter, Sarah. They originally lived in, and were citizens of, the United Kingdom. The relationship broke down in August 1999 and in December 1999 the appellant flew to Australia with Sarah using false passports. In February 2000, he was detained and held at the Villawood Detention Centre, presumably as an illegal immigrant. 
     
      
    7 Subsequently, Ms Oswald came to Australia to rejoin her daughter. She took up residence with Mr Glenn Wakeham. The appellant believed Mr Wakeham was a paedophile who would harm Sarah. These thoughts seem to have become dominant in his thinking. 
     
      
    8 After coming to Australia the appellant formed an acquaintance with Ms Conway who gave evidence at the trial. She stated that she first met the appellant in late January 2000 when she was a proprietor of an internet café in Seaford, a suburb of Melbourne. 
     
      
    9 When the appellant first came into the shop he asked how to send anonymous email. He said his name was Bob. He later told her that he had arrived on an illegal passport under the name of Alexander Mills. He also told her he needed a driver’s licence.  
     
      
    10 The appellant eventually told her that he had abducted his daughter from the United Kingdom and came to Australia. The appellant told her that he was concerned about Mr Wakeham and had been told that he was a sexual deviant, that he was sexually abusive to his daughter Sarah, that he had been violent towards other children, and that he needed to protect Sarah from him. 
     
      
    11 Ms Conway later learned that the appellant had been detained by the Commonwealth police. The day after he was detained, he rang her at work. There were a number of telephone conversations, including one in which the appellant asked Ms Conway to marry him so he could remain in the country where he thought he would get a fairer deal over access to Sarah. He also gave her money to pay his legal representatives. 
     
      
    12 On one occasion when she visited him in detention the appellant gave her $10,000. He asked her to take the money and contact Dave from the United Kingdom and “it would be arranged through Dave that a prostitute would come forth and put up a story that (the appellant) had created on a floppy disc regarding Mr Wakeham.” The appellant told Ms Conway that there was a pretty bad story on the disc, which he gave to Ms Conway. She later threw the disc away. At first she kept the money in a fruit bowl at home but eventually took it to her shop and put it in her safe, which was never locked. She said that she later discovered that the money had been stolen by a casual employee. 
     
      
    13 Whilst in detention, the appellant spoke to Ms Conway about gaining custody of Sarah. He was confident he could do this but also said he had a plan B, which he had pre-arranged with Dave before he left the United Kingdom. That plan was to kill Mr Wakeham, but that he did not intend at that time to kill Ms Oswald because he believed she served the purpose of looking after Sarah. 
     
      
    14 The appellant also asked Ms Conway to contact Mr Wakeham’s ex-wife Patricia Wakeham. He believed that Patricia would say Mr Wakeham was guilty of sexual misconduct. Ms Conway told him that she spoke to Patricia who said that she could no longer recall the alleged sexual abuse. The appellant told Ms Conway to tell Patricia that she had to remember in order to get any monies from him. 
     
      
    15 After the appellant was transferred to Villawood there was a conversation concerning family law proceedings on 21 March 2000. The appellant said that he was outraged, fuming, that his ex-wife had gone up to Townsville and was “in his bed now.” He also said it was time to call up the favour from Dave. Two days later the appellant called Ms Conway again and said he now wanted the favour doubled. She asked him what he meant and he said he also wanted Ms Oswald killed. He said that she no longer served the purpose and was no longer needed. In cross-examination the appellant denied these conversations took place. 
     
      
    16 Ms Conway eventually spoke to Dave in the United Kingdom about doing favours for the appellant. She told the appellant that Dave said that nobody would be doing anything for the appellant because he still owed money for favours that he had been doing back there for him. The appellant later told Ms Conway that he had rung Dave and everything had been fixed up and that he would give Ms Conway a description of Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham to pass on to Dave. As it happened, Ms Conway had a friend in the Commonwealth Police to whom she was passing on this information. 
     
      
    17 In early April 2000, the appellant told her “God has provided.” The following day the appellant told her that he had met an inmate for whom he was going to pay the bond for his release. He had discussed with the inmate, named Basso, that Basso would kill Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham. In the week between his release and leaving the country, Basso would travel to Mr Wakeham’s house and make it look like a drug related robbery gone wrong. In cross-examination the appellant denied this conversation took place. 
     
      
    18 After learning that Basso had been released, Ms Conway called the police and spoke to Det Small, and later Dets Laidlaw and Platt. Two days after Basso was released, the appellant asked Ms Conway to send Basso an SMS text message saying, “hope all goes well. If can’t get two, one, the woman, will do.” 
     
      
    19 A couple of weeks later, when it became apparent that Basso was not going to do anything, Ms Conway had a conversation with the appellant where he said that his solicitor had given him a number for a “hit-man” named Chris, that he had been trying to ring him, but could not get through. Ms Conway said that the appellant asked her to ring him and tell him the appellant was “kosher” and that everything was OK. Shortly after this, Ms Conway spoke to Det Small, who, on 27 April 2000 was at Ms Conway’s residence, when the appellant rang again. Ms Conway told the appellant that she had met with an associate of the hit man, M, who wished to meet the appellant at Villawood. 
     
      
    20 On 2 May 2000, Det Small returned and placed a telephone intercept on her home phone. In evidence, Ms Conway said that at some point before her phones were tapped the appellant told her he was going to use the codeword of “gathering legal evidence” to mean having Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham murdered. This evidence was critical to the prosecution’s understanding of the relevant conversations that were recorded. 
     
      
    21 A conversation recorded at 10.28 pm on 2 May 2000, following the appellant’s first meeting with M, contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Yeah, that’s absolutely fine, they’re going to see if they can find the evidence that’s needed. Um, obviously they wanted some sort of, you know, up front expenses … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        C: Just one? 
        
       
       
        
        A: No, no, well, you know, it depends what sort of evidence they can get … but they certainly reckon they can get one, one person, maybe two.” 
        
       
      
    22 There was a conversation on 3 May 2000 at 7.03 pm and continued at 7.18 pm, which related to sorting out the issue of where the money would come from and that things had to be done quickly. There was also reference to the possibility that M might have been a “plastic”, which was apparently a reference to the possibility that he was a Federal Police officer. There was a discussion about Ms Oswald being with Mr Wakeham. Then the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “C: I don’t believe for making that mistake she deserves the retribution you’re about to take. 
        
       
       
        
        A: I have no choice because that’s the only way I can solve it.” 
        
       
      
    23 There was a further conversation at 10.34 pm on 3 May 2000 mainly concerning whether Ms Conway had placed the phone call the appellant wanted her to make. 
     
      
    24 A conversation at 5.33 pm on 5 May 2000 contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “A: Well, I was actually wanting you to make a call for me and to talk to these people … who are getting me the evidence and say, now look you know you promised this evidence this morning and it didn’t arrive, right. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A: I’d like to say to them, ‘Look guys, this is getting even more serious. We need legal evidence now, I’m prepared to pay a bonus for it.’ 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        C: Well, I thought Wakeham was one of the main concerns to start off with, he’s still going to be walking around then. 
        
       
       
        
        A: Well, one step at a time, eh. One step at a time.” 
        
       
      
    25 A further conversation at 7.30 pm on 5 May 2000 had the appellant noting that ‘It’s gotta be a permanent solution.” He also told Ms Conway to tell the boys to hurry up. The appellant then received a phone call from M. After that conversation, the appellant called Ms Conway at 8.43 pm and told her that he had now spoken with them: 
     
      
       
        
        “I had a call on the other line when I was talking to you… and I said that you’d be in touch.” 
        
       
      
    26 He also tells her that apparently there were some “shadows” with Oswald. 
     
      
    27 A conversation at 11.09 am on 6 May 2000 had the appellant noting: “I’m a non-violent person. I don’t do the shooting.” 
     
      
    28 A further conversation at 6.18 pm on 7 May 2000 contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “C: Well maybe we should have given Linda a choice. 
        
       
       
        
        A: She has, she made it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        C: You didn’t tell her your plan of action if she … 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yes, she knows and she put it in affidavits what my plans were. (pause) Right. She’s filed affidavits back in the UK and in Australia that I would stop at nothing. I would hire hit men, I would kidnap the child. I would do this, that and the other, right. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A: … So she has to accept the consequences. And she knows what the consequences are. She’s already put that in affidavits.” 
        
       
      
    29 A conversation at 4.55 pm on 8 May 2000 shortly after the second visit to the appellant by M, records the appellant telling Ms Conway he has just had a visit from “these people gathering evidence”, and to expect a call in 15 minutes in relation to the paying of the money. 
     
      
    30 A conversation at 5.23 pm on 8 May 2000 records the appellant pressing Ms Conway to tell the men that the money would be guaranteed. He stressed that it was very urgent, because “they can do it now … but they may not be able to do it in half an hour.” 
     
      
    31 A further conversation at 6.24 pm on the same day contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “C: … They had her all lined up for an accident, but because … the money wasn’t there she’ll live another day. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A: So is he going to send someone tomorrow? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A: Well she was out shopping on her own you see … so it was the perfect opportunity … this opportunity may not come again … but she may not have finished shopping yet … the idea is to say look, if you can do it now, do it now.” 
        
       
      
    32 At 6.55 pm on 8 May 2000, the appellant is recorded in a conversation as telling Ms Conway that he was upset that the matter had not been sorted out that afternoon and there was a further conversation about sorting out the money. 
     
      
    33 On 9 May 2000 the appellant was arrested and taken into police custody. 
     
      
    34 Ms Conway gave evidence that the recordings of the conversations were as she remembered them with nothing deleted or edited.  
     
      
       
      Problems with telephone calls 
       
      
    35 There was an issue at the trial as to whether the recordings that were tendered were of phone calls that had actually been made. Apparently, telephone providers are able to provide what is referred to as “web trace” of a particular telephone service, which provides details of phone calls made to and from a particular number. The web trace of Ms Conway’s telephone service did not contain a record of some of the calls.  
     
      
    36 This matter was addressed in evidence given by David Finlay, an officer of the Optus telephone company. His evidence indicated that, on occasions, the Optus trace may not be complete because it would not record calls from a Telstra service, that are forwarded through more than one exchange. 
     
      
    37 The appellant complained through his counsel on the appeal that Mr Finlay was called to give evidence without prior knowledge to the appellant or his counsel that this would occur. Accordingly it was submitted that the trial had miscarried. 
     
      
    38 However, an examination of the transcript reveals that before Mr Finlay was called, the appellant’s counsel was aware that he was to give evidence and furthermore was granted an adjournment to confer with him during the course of his cross examination. The transcript does not otherwise reveal any application being made for an adjournment and, in my opinion, there can be no suggestion that the trial miscarried because of the evidence of Mr Finlay. 
     
      
       
      Undercover operative M 
       
      
    39 Undercover operative M, as he was described, gave evidence. On 2 May 2000, after receiving a listening device and attending a briefing, he went to the Villawood Detention Centre where he had a conversation with the appellant between 7 and 7.30 pm. The following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “M: All right so matey what’s the go … if you’ve got any … problems with me, you may as well say something now, because otherwise I don’t want to waste my time … 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well you know what I want you to do is to get this thing sorted out … 
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
        M. And I’m certain that you want, you want them knocked basically 
        
       
       
        
        A. Mm 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Who do you want knocked, two or one? … 
        
       
       
        
        A. I suppose probably one, one certainly, and maybe two you know … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. And I’ve got to be very careful what I say to you because you know I mean you might be wired up. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. In a perfect world I would say about getting evidence on at least two people … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Right, okay, evidence on those two people … 
        
       
       
        
        A. But if, if, I had a choice of one or the other, well I want to get evidence on the woman. 
        
       
       
        
        M On the woman. Which is, which is Linda, Linda. 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. So we’re talking about Linda, definitely one, and this Glenn Wakeham or whatever, the boyfriend, the current boyfriend, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        [then there is a conversation about money, where M asks for cash up front, and the appellant agrees to $10,000 up front and then another $10,000] 
        
       
       
        
        M. … how would you like it done? … Do you want any pain involved? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Listen, from my point of view I want to get the evidence, just the two … evidence of the woman principally … 
        
       
       
        
        M. It doesn’t matter what type of evidence, which way it goes, with the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        A. As long as it’s legal, that all (unintelligible) … but you’ve got to understand that with, with gathering evidence on the woman that the daughter is going to be very close. All right? 
        
       
       
        
        M. And you don’t want any harm to the daughter? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Put it this way, that’s if, if, if, if, if something happened to my daughter, I don’t think life would be (unintelligible) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Now mate, … have you thought about when this evidence is gathered right? … that possibly a situation of police could come knocking on the door here … and I’m gunna be one person that they’ll want to speak to, right. I’ve got to have, know some pretty good answer. 
        
       
       
        
        [Then there is a conversation where the appellant tells M of an affidavit he has filed concerning Wakeham, a prostitute in Townsville and Wakeham sexually using her child] 
        
       
       
        
        A. What I’m saying is … I’ve employed you to find, is to find that person, if you possibly can, OK? So if anybody asks me why did you come, I’ll say I asked him to go and get the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. I know that, I know if I screw up you’ll kill me, right, let’s not be stupid about it, a spade a spade. That’s what you do …” 
        
       
      
    40 On 4 May 2000, at 5.40 pm, there was a recorded telephone conversation between M and the appellant where M tells the appellant that his “missus” is no longer in Townsville and is coming down to Sydney. The following was also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “M. … We are going to neglect looking at number two Glen, OK. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. All right well you have to go for the woman. 
        
       
       
        
        M. We’ll go for the woman, the business will be done for the woman, mate, no problems. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Once, once my mate does the business your daughter is going to be left on her own. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeh, well, it won’t be long I’m sure 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. So basically, yeh, what I’m saying is you got no problems with my mate doing it in front of your daughter. Doing the business in front of her? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I haven’t got the choice. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. All right, well the situation could be a car accident or something along those lines mate. 
        
       
       
        
        A. You’ve got to do it. I mean (inaudible) what happens is she’s going to be in the Family Court tomorrow. 
        
       
       
        
        [On 5 May 2000 the appellant was before the Family Court for an appeal hearing].” 
        
       
      
    41 A further telephone conversation was recorded between M and the appellant at 7.35 pm on 5 May 2000. However, part of the conversation was not recorded due to a malfunction of the relevant equipment. M made notes of the missing conversation at the time to the best of his recollection and gave evidence of that conversation at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant told M that he had seen his daughter that day (at court) and that she was shy, introverted and bruised, and he wanted to swear an affidavit about this but was told not to bother. The following was also said: 
        
       
       
        
        M. Mate, there’s been two blokes with your missus. My mate thinks they are Federal Police – cops … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. Nothing has changed … in any shape or form or whatever. 
        
       
       
        
        M. Yeh. No well, all I want to let you know is that the job will be done but it might be changed in how we do it. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, it’s just got to be done, hasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. All right, so it’s going to change and mate I think it’s going to get to the stage where we might have to poison her. 
        
       
       
        
        A. So be it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Mate, don’t worry he’ll knock her …” 
        
       
      
    42 On 8 May 2000, at 4.15 pm, M visited the Villawood Detention Centre and had a recorded conversation with the appellant. They spoke about the money that had previously been organised but had not yet been paid. The following was also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “M. My mate’s ready, he could do it. And it makes it easier for him because your little daughter’s away. He can do the knock easier. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. What comes to say that we do the knock and come through you and there’s no money. What happens then? … That’s what gives me the shits, I don’t know whether you’re trying to double cross or what. 
        
       
       
        
        A. ‘A’ I’ve got the cash here, all right. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        M. Well that’s right. Mate, that’s why Jacko’s ringing me in a flap, because there’s no money there. He’s not gunna do a knock for nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, no, no.” 
        
       
      
    43 In cross-examination M denied his job was to encourage the appellant to say he wanted a contract killing done, but instead he was to assess the situation and use his undercover skills to the best of his ability. 
     
      
    44 In re-examination, M said that in relation to the meetings and telephone calls with the appellant nothing had been deleted, added, or changed from the tapes. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    45 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. In relation to some of the telephone conversations, he suggested that the tapes had been altered and others were fakes. He also sought to explain the reference to obtaining evidence as being a reference to obtaining evidence about Mr Wakeham so that he would have a basis for applying for joint custody of his daughter. 
     
      
    46 Evidence was given of the serious distress that the appellant experienced due to his incarceration and concerns in relation to his daughter. Records from the Detention Centre indicate that he had had suicidal tendencies for which he was put on medication. These problems are reflected in the telephone conversations on various occasions. 
     
      
    47 It is apparent that the jury did not accept the appellant’s account of the events and were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the recorded conversations were reliable and disclosed the elements of the relevant offences. 
     
      
       
      The appeal – submissions of counsel 
       
      
    48 At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant advanced a submission that the trial had miscarried because the trial judge had not adequately identified for the jury the relevant elements of the evidence of Ms Conway. In particular, it was submitted that the defence challenge to her credit, which was based on the loss of the $10,000 given to her by the appellant, was not put before the jury. The assertion was that Ms Conway had concocted the allegations against the appellant so that she could effectively “steal” the money. Criticism was also made in relation to his Honour’s discussion of the taped conversations. A submission was also made that there was fresh evidence, which was now available from Telstra which, if it had been available to the appellant at the trial, would have provided assistance in relation to his allegation that some of the telephone calls had been fabricated. Finally, counsel submitted that the appellant had been disadvantaged by a failure by the Crown to inform his counsel that Mr Finlay would be called and an indication given of the evidence that he would give. 
     
      
       
      Mr Finlay’s evidence 
       
      
    49 I have already referred to the position in relation to Mr Finlay’s evidence. With respect to the Telstra material, the Crown tendered evidence on the appeal, which indicates that the relevant material was included in the Crown brief, which was provided to the appellant’s solicitors before the trial. Accordingly, any submission that the material is fresh evidence, which could now be of assistance to the appellant, must be rejected. 
     
      
       
      The summing up in relation to Ms Conway 
       
      
    50 During his summing up, the trial judge gave the jury a detailed analysis of much of the evidence given at the trial. On a number of occasions during the summing up, reference is made to the evidence of Miss Conway and M and the content of the recorded conversations is also referred to. This was inevitable having regard to the nature of the Crown case. The judge was also careful to put before the jury the response, which the appellant made to that evidence and the challenge that had been brought to it in cross-examination. As I have indicated, a significant issue in the appellant’s case was that the money, which the appellant had given to Ms Conway, rather than being stolen by one of her employees, was wrongly taken by Ms Conway herself. 
     
      
    51 In his summing up, the trial judge drew attention to these matters and also provided a detailed account of the submissions, which the appellant’s counsel had made to the jury in the course of his address. Amongst other matters his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lucas, on behalf of the accused, reminded you that this trial is not a popularity contest. He said that the accused’s purpose was to come to Australia to try to get evidence to protect his daughter Sarah. Mr Lucas asked, can there be any doubt that the accused was concerned about Sarah and wanted evidence to try and protect her. Mr Lucas pointed out to you that there are no recorded conversations before 2 May 2000 and that in considering evidence of earlier conversations you should bear in mind that Debbie Conway is not in fact a decent person who just wished to help the accused, that the accused was in fact a very naïve person when it came to Debbie Conway. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Lucas said that the question of whether Ms Conway stole the accused’s money is not irrelevant because you can look at that question to determine her credibility. Mr Lucas says the money was obviously not stolen by Kelly and suggests that Ms Conway had in her mind that she also had a chance to get hold of the money that the accused gave Basso.” 
        
       
      
    52 I have carefully reviewed the totality of the summing up. Having regard to the evidence, which comprised the Crown case and the nature of the appellant’s case, I am satisfied that the summing up by the trial judge was both fair and adequately reflected the appellant’s defence. 
     
      
    53 At the end of the summing up, the trial judge asked counsel whether there were matters that required further consideration. Counsel for the appellant raised a concern that, because it was central to both the Crown case and the defence case that the recorded conversations were in fact accurate recordings of the actual conversations, his Honour should be careful to remind the jury that they cannot act upon the tapes unless they were satisfied that they are in fact accurate recordings of what was actually said. Although his Honour believed that he had given appropriate directions, he acceded to the application and the jury were recalled and his Honour gave the following further directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lucas asked me to make clear to you, if I have not already made it clear, one matter. The one matter is this. As I have told you the Crown relies upon the conversations directly, these conversations, the four of them, between the undercover operative M and the accused to prove the soliciting with intent to murder. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the portions of those conversations that the Crown must rely on to prove the two solicitations as set out in the indictment, if you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those conversations occurred then it is your duty to acquit the accused. But put another way, if you have a reasonable doubt that those conversations ever took place in those terms at that time, you should acquit the accused. Is that clear enough” 
        
       
      
    54 Having already completed his summing up, these further directions by his Honour must have assumed significant importance in the minds of the jury. Although I am satisfied that the summing up was balanced, these further directions ensured that the appellant’s position was clearly and adequately put before the jury. 
     
      
    55 I have reached a similar conclusion in relation to his Honour’s summing up with respect to the individual tape recordings. It is plain that if this evidence was to be adequately explained to the jury his Honour must refer to it. That reference had to include a reference to the various conversations allegedly recorded which were of relevance to the Crown case. A reading of the summing up confirms, in my opinion, that it was fair but if there was any need to ensure balance, this was again provided by the additional directions which his Honour gave and to which I have already referred. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s written submissions 
       
      
    56 A number of written submissions were filed by the appellant together with submissions by way of “commentary” on the Crown submissions. The submissions are lengthy and in many places repetitive. Some lack clarity. However, I have attempted to identify each element about which the appellant complains and determine whether it has substance. 
     
      
       
      Entrapment 
       
      
    57 The appellant submits that M was an agent provocateur and at the time he was alleged to have committed the offences there was no person in Australia who could, in fact, have carried out any possible killing. Without the visit of M to the Villawood Detention Centre, the appellant says he would have had no opportunity to commit the crime. There was no-one else he could have engaged to organise the undertaking. 
     
      
    58 It is not apparent how the appellant says that he was entrapped nor the evidence on which he relies to support the submission. The evidence from M was of conversations he had with the appellant during which the appellant expressed his wish, upon which he had already determined, to harm the proposed victims. Entrapment involves “as a necessary element the idea that an accused person has been induced to commit a crime which he or she otherwise would not have committed or would have been unlikely to commit” R v Sloane (1990) 49 A Crim R 270 at 272-3. This was not the case here. 
     
      
    59 The appellant accepts that Australian law does not recognise a defence of substantive entrapment. However, if the relevant circumstances exist, evidence obtained through means which themselves involve the commission of an offence or are otherwise improper may be excluded: R v Ridgeway (1995) 78 A Crim R 307. I can identify no capacity for the application of those principles in the present case. Furthermore, the submission that there was an entrapment is not consistent with the defence that the appellant put forward at the trial and which he seeks to sustain on the appeal: ie that he did not commit the offence and his conversations were related to other matters. In my opinion, this ground has no substance. 
     
      
    60 When considering the admission of this material at the trial, his Honour also considered the provision of s 138 of the Evidence Act. Because the evidence was, in my opinion, properly obtained, consideration of the section is unnecessary. In any event, I can discern no error in the approach which his Honour took to the application of the section in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
       
      Use of recordings 
       
      
    61 Under the heading “Use of recordings”, the appellant submits that, because the evidence of the conversations was illegally obtained, the trial judge failed to properly consider whether it should be admitted into evidence having regard to the provisions of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. The factual basis for the appellant’s submissions is not clear. Warrants to permit that evidence to be obtained were apparently issued and the trial judge found that the evidence was lawfully obtained. His Honour found that “all the telephone intercepts and the recordings of the face to face conversations were authorised by appropriate warrants.” 
     
      
    62 The matter was the subject of a voir dire hearing and judgments by his Honour on 19 September and 25 September 2001. Those judgments are comprehensive and consider the relevant principles and apply them to the factual matters found by his Honour. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will secondly deal with the question of the listening device and telephone intercepts and their transcripts. The voir dire question before me involved determining whether the pre-conditions for the interception have been satisfied. That is to say a valid authorisation, and that the investigation was carried out in accordance with that authorisation. I am satisfied that there was proper authorisation for these intercepts in accordance with the warrants issued” (T 25/09/01 p 15). 
        
       
      
    63 In these circumstances, the complaint that his Honour failed to appropriately apply the principles found in s 138 of the Evidence Act is, as with the submission in relation to entrapment, difficult to understand.  
     
      
    64 His Honour also considered the challenge which the appellant made to the authenticity of the recordings and held, in my opinion correctly, that any question of inaccuracy or falsification of a recording was a matter for the jury having regard to all the relevant evidence. 
     
      
       
      Vulnerability of the appellant 
       
      
    65 Under this heading, the appellant emphasises that, prior to the police operation, he had been put on suicide watch and was under strong medication. He says as a consequence he was a vulnerable person made so by his concern as to the welfare of his daughter who was then in the company of a person whom the appellant believed to be a sexual deviant. In these circumstances the appellant submits that, being vulnerable, the evidence obtained by the police operation should have been excluded from the court. He refers to the decision of the High Court in Ridgeway and R v Mack, a decision of the Canadian Court of Criminal Appeal (1988) 44 CCC (3d) 513. 
     
      
    66 I can find no substance in this submission. There is no question that the appellant was burdened by concerns for his daughter’s welfare, whether real or imagined, and the fact of his incarceration at the time he committed the relevant offence. It may be that these matters caused him to lose his balance leading to the commission of the offence. However, there is no suggestion, either at his trial or on this appeal, that the appellant was suffering from any condition affecting his capacity to commit the relevant offence. Instead, his defence has been that he did not intend harm to the prospective victims and his conversations were innocent and have been misunderstood as having sinister connotations. 
     
      
       
      Use of transcripts 
       
      
    67 I have previously considered some aspects of the appellant’s concerns in relation to the use of the recordings of various conversations. In his written document, the appellant again challenges the accuracy of the recordings. That issue was considered by the jury. Concerns are also raised in relation to the web trace and the fact that it does not record all of the conversations with Ms Conway. I have previously discussed that matter. With respect to the conversation with M, which was not adequately recorded, M utilised his contemporaneous note to give evidence as to the content of that conversation and, accordingly, that evidence was, in my opinion, correctly admitted. Other transcripts of the recordings were not challenged as an accurate record of the conversation. 
     
      
    68 His Honour was careful to confine the jury’s use of transcripts and, in relation to the recordings and transcripts, gave the following directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “The recordings which the Crown relies upon between the accused and Debbie Conway and more directly, the accused and the undercover operative Mal, you will have with you in the jury room as exhibits H and J in the form of those CD’s and I will ensure that there is some form of CD player in there so that you can play them again if you wish to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        Although I told you during the course of the trial that in the ordinary course of events you and I do not get to see documents marked for identification. The bundle of transcripts which is marked for identification ten is an exception to that rule. Those transcripts have not been marked as an exhibit in the trial as have all the other exhibits that you will have because as I said earlier, the transcripts themselves are not the evidence, the evidence is the actual recordings themselves that is to say the sounds that you hear on the recording. I will repeat part of the important direction that I previously gave you in relation to these transcripts. The evidence of the conversation which the transcript purports to describe is not what the transcript says but rather the sounds on the recording itself. As I said earlier, the transcript is simply an attempt by somebody to record what they think can be heard on these recordings. You might think that the transcripts are substantially accurate, although not completely accurate. What is important is what you believe you can hear on the recordings and not what the person who prepared the transcript thought that they could hear. The transcripts were given to you simply to assist you in following what is said on the recordings themselves. As I said to you earlier, you must not form any conclusion of fact or draw any inference against the accused on the basis of anything contained in any of those recordings unless you are satisfied that the particular words can be heard on the recordings themselves. If the transcript suggests that the recording contains words which are said by the Crown to be against the accused, or you think are against the accused, then you should disregard those words unless and until you are satisfied that the recordings actually contain those words. 
        
       
       
        
        There is one exception to this, and that is the recording of the telephone call between the accused and Mal on 5 May 2000 as per Tab B in the folder. That has in fact been tendered and is a separate exhibit, exhibit E. You will recall that in that conversation or during that conversation there are a series of what sounds like electronic noises where words are obscured and that the undercover operative said that he was obliged to supplement the words that can be heard with notes that he took. He said that in parts of that transcript, exhibit E and Tab 12 comprise his reconstruction of what was said where the actual words uttered cannot be heard. You will remember that evidence was given by the undercover operative that because of that poor recording, he said we, that is to say the police, took it to a technical section to see whether that recording could be enhanced, but that they were unable to enhance it and that he was unable to explain why those electronic noises appear on that recording. He said that he made those notes of what was said only a matter of minutes after the conversation actually took place. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to that particular recording and that particular exhibit, exhibit E or Tab 12 if you like, I give you this direction, if you think that any of the words which cannot be heard are critical then you must be satisfied that they were in fact spoken as alleged by the undercover operative before you can take them into account against the accused. Please remember that the accused says that that conversation simply did not occur. The accused has told you that it is not his voice on that recording and that that particular recording is a complete fabrication.” 
        
       
      
    69 In my opinion, in the circumstances, these directions were adequate and appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Interim rulings 
       
      
    70 The appellant raises a number of matters under the heading of “Interim Rulings”. They include late delivery of documents by the Crown, late disclosure of the existence of Federal Police Superintendent John Draffin, the operation of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act, 1997, questions of whether the transcripts were substantially accurate, admission of his ERISP, email-plan B and witness coaching. 
     
      
    71 Many of the matters raised under this heading involve an exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to admit evidence. The appellant was represented by experienced and competent counsel at his trial and it is not apparent that, by reason of the time at which documents were disclosed and other information given to the appellant’s defence lawyers, any difficulty arose that would require this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    72 With respect to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act, 1997 the appellant submits that a necessary authorisation was not obtained, although he does not articulate how that has infected the trial process. The “Controlled Operations Act” does not exhaust the means by which the police can investigate allegedly criminal conduct. In any event, his Honour was required to consider whether or not the evidence could be admitted in the exercise of the discretion provided by s 138(1) of the Evidence Act. I cannot identify any error in his Honour’s consideration of these matters. 
     
      
    73 With respect to the admission of the ERISP the appellant complains that, being a citizen of the United Kingdom, he had particular rights pursuant to the Crimes Act  1914 (Cth) s 23L and 23P whilst he was in custody. He submits that these rights were ignored by the NSW Police and accordingly the interviews were inadmissible. 
     
      
    74 His Honour the trial judge dealt with this submission concluding that if there was a difficulty, it arose only in relation to Commonwealth crimes. The appellant, having been charged with a breach of State legislation, the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was of no relevance. In my opinion, this conclusion was correct. 
     
      
    75 The reference to “email-plan B” is a reference to a ruling made by his Honour to exclude from the evidence an email said to emanate from John Widdoes. During the course of the cross-examination of the appellant, reference was made to plan B. His Honour’s exclusion of the email from the evidence did not prohibit reference being made to Plan B and so far as I can discern (the transcript references were not provided by the appellant) no objection was taken to the cross-examination when it occurred. The application made for the discharge of the jury was in my opinion correctly refused by the trial judge. 
     
      
    76 It is suggested that his Honour’s ruling “represents an exhibition of bias against the appellant.” In my opinion, this submission has no substance and should be rejected. 
     
      
    77 With respect to the alleged coaching of a witness this submission is made in relation to Ms Conway. She was asked about this matter when cross-examined and, accordingly, the jury was able to assess the veracity of Ms Conway for themselves. I can find no substance in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Judge’s summing up 
       
      
    78 The appellant makes a number of criticisms of the summing up of the trial judge. Some of those criticisms have been identified by counsel in the oral submissions and it is unnecessary for me to refer to them again. Consideration of the summing up reveals, in my opinion, a careful analysis by his Honour of the relevant evidence and the response which the appellant made to it. I am satisfied that the summing up was appropriately balanced.  
     
      
    79 Complaint is also made that his Honour, by providing guidance on lying, raised in the jury’s mind a concern that the appellant may have lied. The appellant asserts that he did not tell lies on any occasion and, accordingly, his Honour was in error in providing the usual direction in relation to that aspect of the matter. 
     
      
    80 In my opinion, this submission has no substance. The Crown case was based upon the proposition that the appellant had lied on a number of occasions in relation to relevant matters. Accordingly, a direction was called for. It did not presuppose any opinion from his Honour as to the veracity of the appellant’s evidence but a reminder to the jury of the way in which it should approach the evidence if it concluded that the appellant had lied. 
     
      
       
      Hearsay – The evidence of Mr Finlay 
       
      
    81 A further submission is made that the evidence of Mr Finlay was hearsay and should have been excluded. This submission is made because apparently it appeared in the course of his cross-examination that Mr Finlay was giving evidence about the operation of the Optus equipment, which was in part based on knowledge he had been given by another person in Optus. 
     
      
    82 The difficulty with this submission is that when it became apparent that Mr Finlay’s knowledge was in part based upon information given to him by others, no application was made to have the evidence struck out nor was any other application made. The matter was simply not raised. 
     
      
    83 Of course it would have been open to the Crown to call other persons to give evidence about exactly the same matter. Furthermore, it was open to the defence to call a witness to contradict the testimony of Mr Finlay if it was in fact disputed. However, no complaint was made and it must be assumed that experienced counsel considered that the identified difficulty was of no concern. The fundamental issue was that the web trace was not necessarily determinative and did not establish that a call had, or had not, been made. Accordingly, as the evidence did not purport to prove that a conversation had in fact occurred, this being proved by other independent evidence, the matter was of little consequence in the trial. 
     
      
       
      Book - “Secrets of the Jury Room” 
       
      
    84 One of the jurors at the trial was a professional journalist. He has since published a book, which relates his experiences as a juror. 
     
      
    85 The appellant now seeks to investigate the mind of the author and asks that the Court consider sections of the book, which he submits reflect the jury’s consideration of relevant parts of the evidence. An application was made on 16 September 2005 that this Court require the author of the book to attend to give evidence at the hearing of this appeal. That application was rejected. 
     
      
    86 In my opinion, it would not be permissible for this Court to investigate the mind of the juror either directly or by consideration of anything published in the book see R v Emmett; R v Masland (1988) 14 NSWLR 327; see also Richard John Sinclair Laws (No 2) (2000) 116 A Crim R 70. 
     
      
    87 This submission is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Error on the face of the indictment 
       
      
    88 The appellant complains that the form of the indictment could not support the charge for which he was convicted. The indictments were in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “That (the appellant) between 2 May and 8 May 2000 at Villawood in the State of New South Wales, did solicit an undercover police operative with the assumed name of ‘M’ to murder Myra Linda Oswald/Glenn Stuart Wakeham.” 
        
       
      
    89 The appellant’s complaint is that, because the alleged arrangement was that M would engage a person named “Jacko” to effect the murders, the indictment did not accord with s 26 of the Crimes Act. The argument, as I understand it, is that the indictment should have referred to “Jacko” as the person solicited. 
     
      
    90 I do not accept this argument. Even though the understanding may have been that M would engage another to carry out the killing, the relevant offence was committed once the arrangement between the appellant and M was effected (King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423). The person who M might engage to carry out the necessary physical act did not have to be named in the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    91 I have indicated that the appellant provided the Court with written material. It includes a document headed “Commentary on Crown Submissions”, which takes issue with various submissions made by the Crown in a written document. That document and the appellant’s observations on the Crown submissions join issue with various propositions advanced by the Crown. Those matters are raised in the consideration that I have already given the appellant’s submissions and it is unnecessary to further refer to them. 
     
      
    92 Further documents were received. One was headed “Additional Representations” and relates to the publication by the juror. I have already considered that matter. Further documents headed “Grounds of Appeal” and “Additional Representation” were also reviewed. All of the written material provided by the appellant has been considered in preparing these reasons. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    93 Although the appellant’s counsel advanced only confined grounds of appeal they have been significantly expanded by the appellant in his written submissions. I have reviewed the entirety of those submissions and considered the evidence tendered at the trial. It is apparent that the jury accepted the evidence of Ms Conway, which enabled the various conversations to be placed into an appropriate context and the appellant’s intentions understood. The jury also accepted the integrity of the recordings of various conversations. Once those conversations are understood, with the benefit of Ms Conway’s evidence as to the “code” the appellant used, the Crown case can only be described as strong. I can find no basis for this Court to intervene. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    94 Application was made for leave to appeal against sentence. It was not supported by written submissions and the Court was not directed to any written submissions on this aspect in a letter from the appellant’s solicitors dated 28 November 2005, which identified the documents the Court is asked to consider in the appeal. 
     
      
    95 The offences of which the appellant was convicted were serious, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. They were deserving of a significant term of imprisonment, both as punishment of the appellant and to fulfil the need to provide specific and general deterrence. I can discern no error in the sentence which the trial judge imposed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    96 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence and dismiss that appeal. 
     
      
    97 HISLOP J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    98 ROTHMAN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
       
       ********** 
       
       
      Amendments 
       
      Since delivering judgment in this matter the Court has become aware that matters of sentence of the appellant were dealt with by this Court on an earlier occasion. Accordingly, the reference to an application for leave to appeal against sentence at paras [3], [4], [94] and [95] is redundant. As the matters of sentence have already been disposed of these proceedings were concerned only with the appeal against conviction. 
       
       
      Accordingly, the appropriate order of the Court is: 
       
       
      1. Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was indicted upon four counts as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count One - Kidnapping 
       
      That on 9 May 2001 at Kurri Kurri in the State of New South Wales did detain John William Summerville with intent to hold John William Summerville for advantage. 
       
       
      Count Two – Kidnapping 
       
      That on or about 20 May 2001 at Hamilton in the State of New South Wales did take away John William Summerville with intent to hold John William Summerville for advantage. 
       
       
      Count Three – Attempted Kidnapping 
       
      That on 13 June 2001 at Kurri Kurri in the State of New South Wales he did attempt to take away John William Summerville with intent to hold John William Summerville for advantage. 
       
       
      Count Four – Maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent 
       
       
      That on 13 June 2001 at Kurri Kurri in the State of New South Wales he did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon John William Summerville with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to him. 
       
      
    2 In relation to count one the appellant was charged along with two of his brothers. All the accused were acquitted on that count. 
     
      
    3 With respect to the second count the appellant was charged with his brothers and three other persons. The appellant and Daniel Klopfer were convicted and the other four accused were acquitted. The appellant was convicted on the third and fourth counts. 
     
      
    4 The first three counts were brought pursuant to s 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 (since repealed) and the fourth count pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    5 The appellant was sentenced on count two to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three and half years. On count three the appellant was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. On count four he was sentenced to eight years with a non-parole period of five and half years. The sentences were all to date from 13 June 2003 and were to be served concurrently. The effective term of imprisonment is accordingly eight years with a non-parole period of five and half years. 
     
      
    6 The appellant appeals his conviction. Although application was made for leave to appeal against sentence no submissions in support of that application have been made. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      Background 
       
      
    7 In the period of May and June 2001 Mr Summerville stayed from time to time with his partner, Lynelle Baker who lived at 72A Edward Street, Kurri Kurri. The appellant lived at his parents’ house at 142 Rawson Street, Kurri Kurri. The other accused also lived in Kurri Kurri. 
     
      
    8 On 6 May 2001, Mr Summerville drove the appellant, whom he had known for three or four years, from Cessnock to his parents’ house in Rawson Street, Kurri Kurri where the appellant’s brothers, Jamie and Alan Williams were also present. During the drive to Kurri Kurri Mr Summerville asked the appellant for a half a pound of pot and the appellant told him the price was $2,000. Mr Summerville told the appellant that he could not immediately pay this sum but was waiting on a cheque for engineering work that he had performed, which he expected to receive in about 3 days. The appellant said “no worries”. Mr Summerville was expecting a cheque for between $18,000 and $20,000. At the appellant’s house, and in the presence of his brothers, the appellant handed Mr Summerville eight glad bags each containing one ounce of marijuana and Mr Summerville handed him a cheque for $2,000. The appellant asked for interest on the money at $500 per week if payment by Mr Summerville was delayed. On this occasion the appellant showed Mr Summerville some weapons and ammunition rounds. 
     
      
    9 Although Mr Summerville had given the appellant the cheque for $2,000 it was anticipated that the appellant would not present it until the money he was expecting had been received. 
     
      
       
      The evidence relating to the first count 
       
      
    10 Some days later on 9 May 2001 the appellant telephoned Mr Summerville, who was in Maitland. He asked him to call around and see him. A friend drove Mr Summerville to Lynelle Baker’s house and Mr Summerville walked from there to the appellant’s parents’ house in Rawson Street. When he arrived there, the appellant and his brothers were present. The appellant asked him “you got the money? You got the money?” Mr Summerville said he had not - “it hasn’t come through” - and the appellant said to him “well, come out here and have a look at this” and he, his brother Allan and Mr Summerville walked out to the back shed, the appellant leading and Allan following. Jamie Williams was holding a rifle in a gun bag and the appellant said to him “shoot anyone that comes to the door”. In the shed the appellant pulled out, from under his shirt pocket, a small silver pistol that he had shown to Mr Summerville on 6 May 2001. He held it with both hands pointed at Mr Summerville’s head and said to him “get on the fucking ground.” Mr Summerville lay face down on the ground. The appellant said to his brother Allan, “Allan, put them cable ties on him”. A cable tie was placed around Mr Summerville’s wrists while he was lying face down on the concrete. 
     
      
    11 The appellant said to Mr Summerville, “if you move I’ll shoot you in the head and then we’ll set off some crackers to make it look like it was fire works.” They picked Mr Summerville up by his arms, threw a blanket over his head and tied something over his shoulders. They took him out of the shed into the yard and the appellant said “we’re going fishing” and threw him into a fishing boat that was at the back of the yard. Mr Summerville understood the appellant to be saying that he would be used as bait or burly.  
     
      
    12 Mr Summerville then told the men that if they gave him a car he would get the appellant his money, at which the appellant took the blanket off him and cut the cable tie with a knife. When the blanket was removed from his head, Mr Summerville saw Jamie Williams was holding the rifle. The appellant gave Mr Summerville the key to his car and Mr Summerville drove off in it. Mr Summerville had been in the shed for less than five minutes. 
     
      
    13 Mr Summerville drove to a friend’s house to try to borrow money from him but he was not at home. He then drove to the house of Lynelle Baker’s sister, Julie, but there was no one there. He went to Kearsley and then to Edward Street, Kurri Kurri and said to Lynelle Baker “I am in a bit of trouble. Daniel thinks I’ve ripped him off. I don’t think we’re safe.” 
     
      
    14 About two days later the appellant telephoned Mr Summerville on his mobile telephone and asked him where he was. Mr Summerville said that he was in Maitland and the car had broken down. The appellant told Mr Summerville that he would send someone to help fix it and although he said he would wait, Mr Summerville parked the car, put the keys on the console, went to Maitland train station, and caught a train to Hamilton where he went to 142 Lawson Street. This was the house of Jade English and her child. Thereafter, Mr Summerville received numerous threatening messages from the appellant on his mobile telephone, to which he did not respond. Later, the appellant telephoned Lynelle Baker and told her that he knew where Mr Summerville was staying in Hamilton and that he was on his way to get him.  
     
      
    15 In respect of count one there was no evidence at the trial capable of corroborating the evidence of Mr Summerville. An essential element of the charge was that Mr Summerville had been detained by the appellant. The appellant and the two other men accused of this offence were all acquitted. 
     
      
       
      The evidence relating to the second count 
       
      
    16 At about 7 pm or 8 pm on 20 May 2001, while Mr Summerville was watching television and Jade English was doing housework, the appellant, Scott Green and Troy Carberry came in through the back door of the house. The appellant pulled out one of the guns he had shown Mr Summerville and, holding it with both hands, pointed it at his head saying “didn’t think I’d find you, did you?” Jade English took her child to the kitchen. 
     
      
    17 The appellant took Mr Summerville’s mobile telephone and escorted him out of the house to a path beside the house and then to the road. Ms English thought Mr Summerville was not happy. On the road Allan Williams gave Mr Summerville a “smack” in the mouth. Jamie Williams was present as was Daniel Klopfer who was in the driver’s seat of a station wagon. They put Mr Summerville in the back seat and Klopfer drove them to the appellant’s parents’ house in Rawson Street, Kurri Kurri, with the appellant in the front passenger seat. The appellant said to Carberry “if he moves, Carbs, shoot him” and said to Mr Summerville over and over again “where’s me money?” and “we’re going back to Kurri. You’re staying with us until we get the money. We’ve got a suicide note written in your handwriting and we’re going to take you out the bush and hang ya.” According to the Crown case, Mr Summerville had not written a suicide note. 
     
      
    18 When they arrived at the appellant’s parents’ house at 142 Rawson Street, Kurri Kurri, they drove into the yard and the appellant got cable ties from the shed. The appellant and others took Mr Summerville to Lynelle Baker’s place at Edward Street, Kurri Kurri, which was empty. The appellant said “I’m going in to get all your paperwork” and climbed in through a broken window. The appellant came out through the backdoor and they took Mr Summerville in through the backdoor and collected all his paperwork for his business and put it in a brown paper bag with rope handles.  
     
      
    19 They then took Mr Summerville to 53 Mulbring Street, Kurri Kurri which was empty. He was taken inside and when the appellant told him to pawn a generator that he had for his business, he telephoned a loan office and left a message. Mr Summerville was taken into his shed and, with others standing around, the appellant said that he was staying with them until they got their money. Mr Summerville sat on the ground and they tied cable ties around his ankles, knees and hands and Green taped him with sticky tape from his ankles to his knees and from his wrists to his elbows and around his mouth and nose. He was lying on the ground on his side. The appellant told Allan Williams that he was looking after Mr Summerville for the night. They left and shut the door. Mr Summerville stayed on the floor for close to 12 hours with Allan Williams checking on him roughly every half hour. In the morning he chewed through a cable tie and pulled the tape off his eyes and escaped. 
     
      
    20 Both Jade English and Lynelle Baker gave evidence. They supported Mr Summerville’s evidence in significant respects. Jade English said that when Mr Summerville was staying at her home in Hamilton, two men had come inside and one said “you’re coming with us.” They stayed for ten minutes but there was no further conversation. She said that she did not observe them holding anything in their hands and although Mr Summerville left with them he “wasn’t happy at all.” 
     
      
    21 Lynelle Baker, who, as I have indicated, was the girlfriend of Mr Summerville, gave evidence that the appellant had telephoned her and said that he knew Mr Summerville was staying in Hamilton and that he was going to “get him.” She saw Mr Summerville the next morning. He was crying and upset, holding the children and later told her that “they’ve had me tied up all night.” He pulled his sleeves up and showed her marks all the way around his wrists, reddish grazes and indents which she said were “not very big.” There was a big lump over his temple and lumps and bumps all over his head. She stated that the appellant rang her the next morning and stated “he’s escaped” and asked her if she had seen Mr Summerville. She gave evidence of having received numerous calls from the appellant looking for Mr Summerville. 
     
      
       
      The evidence relating to the third and fourth counts 
       
      
    22 At about 9 or 10 o’clock on 13 June 2001 while Mr Summerville was in the bath and Lynelle Baker was hanging clothes on the line, the appellant jumped over the back fence, asked her to move her children out of the way and entered her house. Mr Summerville stood up and started to dry himself when the appellant pulled out a gun and pointed it at his head saying “you’re coming with me”. Mr Summerville put on some clothes and started to walk out of the front door with him. Outside there was a car with its engine running and a man in the driver’s seat. Mr Summerville broke free of the appellant’s grip and ran barefoot until he slipped and fell over at the corner of Edward and Allworth Streets. The appellant chased him saying “you’re coming with me. You’re coming with me. I’ll shoot you in the legs if you don’t come.” When he tried to get up the appellant grabbed him and started throwing punches leaving cuts all over his head. 
     
      
    23 When the motor vehicle was driven up, the appellant said to the driver “get the mallet” and the driver brought a mallet to the appellant who was punching Mr Summerville in the head. After a struggle and while Mr Summerville had his hands held behind his back, the appellant ran at him and struck him in the face with the mallet holding it at the end of the handle. Mr Summerville blacked out and when he looked up the appellant and the driver were getting into the appellant’s parents’ car which was parked on Allworth Street, Kurri Kurri. Lynelle Baker heard a noise from across the road and telephoned the police. Mr Summerville ran into 14 Allworth Street and asked a man to ring an ambulance or the police. Mr Summerville washed his face with a hose and vomited. He was taken to Kurri Hospital and then Maitland Hospital by ambulance until a bed became available at John Hunter Hospital where he was taken. 
     
      
    24 Mr Summerville’s blood was found in the yard of 14 Allworth Street, Kurri Kurri. In telephone calls on 13 June 2001, the appellant asked Lynelle Baker if the law was there. He asked her not to say anything or make a statement to the police. He also asked her “How is his face from falling over on the road?” thereby suggesting that he had not been responsible for Mr Summerville’s injuries. The appellant later abandoned this suggestion and admitted that he had hit the appellant, although he said the blow was delivered with his fist. 
     
      
    25 Mr Summerville was in hospital for 13 days altogether and underwent operations to repair comminuted fractures of the nasal bones and the nasal septum. His teeth did not line up and he could not chew, eat or swallow. He could not see properly and his nose was swollen so he could not smell or taste anything. At the time of the trial he still had trouble in both tasting and smelling food and his eyes started watering in sunlight. In the opinion of Dr Hapangama the injuries suffered by Mr Summerville were possibly consistent with him being struck a single blow with a rubber mallet. 
     
      
    26 On 19 June 2001 in the execution of a search warrant at the house of Allan Williams, one of the appellant’s brothers, at 55 Mulbring Street, Kurri Kurri, cable ties, which he owned, were found by police officers. Earlier, on 16 June 2001, when searching the house of the appellant’s parents at 142 Rawson Street, Kurri Kurri, police officers found Mr Summerville’s mobile telephone, a document bearing the telephone number of Jade English and certain documents of Mr Summerville in a paper bag.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
      
    27 The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He said that he had never detained Mr Summerville and that any contact he had with him had been voluntary on Mr Summerville’s behalf and was solely in order to sort out the payment of the sum of $4,600 owed by Mr Summerville to the appellant as a debt relating to the sale of a car to Mr Summerville. The appellant claimed that Mr Summerville had agreed to purchase the car from him, had taken possession of it, but subsequently caused damage to the car, which required extensive repairs. 
     
      
    28 The appellant stated that Mr Summerville had given him a cheque as security for payment for the car, which, although it could not be met immediately, he assured him would be bankable in the near future. He stated that Mr Summerville claimed that he was owed money by Energy Australia for work that he had done for that organisation. This money was to be paid into the account on which the cheque was written. 
     
      
    29 It was the appellant’s case that after the damage was done to the car, Mr Summerville told the appellant he did not want it anymore but would pay for the repairs. These amounted to a total of $2,000. The appellant denied causing any injury to Mr Summerville until the altercation between them on 13 June 2001. On that date, the appellant stated that he had attended the home of Mr Summerville, and after Mr Summerville threw the first punch, there had been a fight in the course of which the appellant had punched Mr Summerville in the face. He said that he had not struck Mr Summerville with a rubber mallet or any other implement. The appellant said that he had not intended to hit Mr Summerville as hard as he did. 
     
      
    30 In his evidence the appellant stated that the cheque Mr Summerville had given him on 7 May 2001 for $4,600 had been banked on 14 May 2001 but was dishonoured on 17 May 2001. The bank indicated that the reason for dishonour was that there was no existing account. Further enquiries revealed that the account had been closed on 9 May 2001. 
     
      
    31 The appellant gave evidence that it was on 21 May that he went to Hamilton, not 20 May 2001. He said he went there with Daniel Klopfer in Klopfer’s car, without anyone else and with no gun. Mr Summerville went with them from Hamilton to Allan Williams’ house. The appellant said that it had been Mr Summerville’s idea to do so. 
     
      
    32 He said that Allan Williams let the appellant in and went back to bed. Mr Summerville then made a few calls on the house phone resulting in a bag of marijuana being delivered in payment for the repairs to the appellant’s car. This was the marijuana that was recovered by the police at the appellant’s home. Klopfer later gave Mr Summerville’s phone to the appellant and told him that Mr Summerville had left it in Klopfer’s car. The appellant kept the phone. Klopfer gave evidence to the same effect as the appellant. The appellant agreed that he had made numerous calls to Mr Summerville but most went unanswered. 
     
      
    33 In relation to the second count it is submitted by the appellant that the evidence of Mr Summerville as to what occurred at the Hamilton unit was distinctly different from that of Ms English. It is submitted that the evidence of Ms English does not provide support for the allegation that the appellant had taken Mr Summerville away with intent to hold him for advantage. Although the appellant and Klopfer had admitted their presence at the unit, they claimed that Mr Summerville had left voluntarily with them and remained with them to make phone calls and organise some form of payment to the appellant. 
     
      
    34 With respect to counts three and four, the appellant accepts that there was evidence supporting Mr Summerville’s account. This was the evidence of Lynelle Baker who stated that on 13 June the appellant had called over the back fence of their home while Mr Summerville was inside in the bath. The appellant asked if he was there (meaning Mr Summerville), jumped the back fence, told Ms Baker to take the children outside and went inside and closed the door. Ms Baker said that she did not see any firearms. She initially heard banging noises and then a huge bang and then rang 000. Prior to the police arriving, the appellant rang her and asked whether ”the law” was there and told her not to make a statement and to be a “good girl.” 
     
      
    35 The appellant’s account was that he had attended the home of Mr Summerville with the intention of confronting him. He jumped the back fence and entered through the back door. He stated that he exited through the front door and that, when Mr Summerville came outside, an argument commenced. Mr Summerville pushed the appellant and ran off. The appellant chased him and a fight commenced. The appellant gave evidence that he and Mr Summerville were throwing punches but that the appellant ended up getting “the better” of the fight. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    36 There are three grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Ground One - The trial judge erred in refusing to direct the jury that the appellant could rely on the defence that he had a “claim of right”. 
       
      
    37 Under this ground the appellant submits that the qualification that was provided in s 90A permits of a defence that when a person is owed money they may detain the debtor against his or her will until the money is repaid. The argument was raised at the trial and was dismissed by the judge who ruled that the proviso had no application and was limited to “a disputed custody case or something of that kind.” His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s a right to the possession of the person that is the – I believe the fundamental words, not the right to the possession of the advantage which you were seeking by holding that person. Anyhow I have said this deliberately so that you are well protected by it. Makes an interesting case.” 
        
       
      
    38 The submission in this appeal extends beyond the terms of the proviso to s 90A. It is submitted that the decision of this Court in R v Fuge (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 provides support for the proposition that if an accused person believed, in good faith, that he or she was entitled to take away or detain a person in order to secure the advantage in question a defence founded on a claim of right is available. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, the submission must be rejected. Fuge was concerned with the availability of a defence of claim of right to a charge of robbery. Although Heydon JA expressed reservations in the matter, this Court left open the question of whether or not a person could be charged with robbing another in circumstances where that person claimed a right to the property, which he or she was alleged to have unlawfully taken. In the course of his reasons, Heydon JA said at [2]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first ground of appeal rested on the proposition that a person who claims to be owed arrears of wages after being dismissed by an employer has a defence to a charge of robbing the employer of cash not exceeding the claimed arrears. By the light of nature that is an astonishing proposition. There are, however, statements in other intermediate courts of appeal which justify it. Those statements call for reconsideration by this Court in a suitable case, there being no High Court decision preventing that course. It is not necessary for the decision of this case to give them reconsideration on this occasion.” 
        
       
      
    40 Whatever be the position in relation to a claim of right to the possession of money or other goods there is no authority that would justify restraining a person against their will in order to secure from that person the claimed money or property. The act of restraining another is of a wholly different character to the taking of money or goods. The liberty of an individual is protected in most circumstances in our society. It is only the relationship of a parent or guardian, or where there has been a breach of the law or other particular situations which may give rise to a “right” to lawfully restrain another person. 
     
      
    41 Counsel for the appellant referred to the decision of Cockburn CJ in R v John Tinkler (1859) 1F.4F.513; 175 ER 832. The case concerned the abduction of a girl under the age of 16, where it was held that an offence would not be established where the accused person honestly believed that he had a right to the custody of the child, even if there was no legal justification for that belief. In that case, the jury was directed that the accused person had no right to act as he had done in taking the child out of the custody of her lawful guardian, but, because he acted without improper motive and believed that he was acting within the law when he took the child away, a “defence” was available. 
     
      
    42 Reference was made to the decision in Tinkler in the judgment of Dawson J in Walden v Hensler (1987) 163 CLR 561. At 591, where his Honour referred to relevant provisions of the Criminal Code 1899 (QLD), and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have set out ss 22 and 24 because they both concern the law dealing with the effect of mistake upon criminal responsibility. In  
        Thomas v The King 
         (1937) 59 CLR 279 at 305-306, Dixon J expressed the view that the two sections state the common law ""with complete accuracy"". However, it has been suggested that at common law an honest claim of right may constitute a defence in some cases which do not relate to property: see  
        Reg. v Tinkler 
         (1859) 1F & F 513 [175 ER 832];  
        Anderson v Nystrom 
         [1941] St.R Qd 56 at 69-70;  
        Olsen v Grain Sorghum Marketing Board; Ex parte Olsen 
         [1962] Qd R 580 at 592-593.  
        It may be doubted whether the defence in such cases, although based upon mistaken belief going to intent, should be classified as a claim of right. Be that as it may, claim of right as a defence at common law has its origin and at least its primary application in cases relating to property and in that application has a settled meaning. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is, of course, always necessary for the prosecution to prove the intent which forms an ingredient of a particular crime and any honestly held belief, whether reasonable or not, which is inconsistent with the existence of that intent will afford a defence. But in addition, there is the wider principle that the existence of any state of mind, however limited, which is an element of a crime, may be negated by an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances which, if true, would make the impugned act [at 592] innocent:  
        Reg v Tolson  
        (1889) 23 QBD 168.” 
        
       
      
    43 As Dawson J makes plain, a claim of right may provide a defence in cases relating to property and may, as Heydon JA acknowledged, be relevant in relation to a charge of robbery. It may also be relevant, as the qualification to s 90A contemplated, to an offence where a person is able to provide a basis for detaining another based upon a right to the custody of that person. However, I am not aware of any right in a person to detain another for the purpose of extracting the payment of a debt. Such a proposition would be offensive to assumptions as to the liberty of persons which are fundamental to our society. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two – The directions to the jury, on the manner in which they may use the fact of an acquittal of the appellant on any one count in considering their verdicts on the other counts, were inadequate. 
       
      
    44 In relation to this ground, the appellant accepts that the trial judge made clear in his directions to the jury that the Crown case depended upon the evidence of Mr Summerville. It is also acknowledged that the trial judge was careful to specify the matters in respect of which Mr Summerville’s evidence may be unreliable.  
     
      
    45 His Honour summarised the position by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you do not accept Mr Summerville the case is over. It pivots on him, you know that. I will say more about that later.” 
        
       
      
    46 Later, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… You must realise that the whole case turns on Mr Summerville.” 
        
       
      
    47 At another point in the summing up the jury were cautioned not to allow a finding of guilt in relation to one count to inappropriately influence their consideration of another count. It must be remembered that there were eleven separate counts in relation to the various accused for the jury to consider. The trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a temptation that does arise in cases where there are multiple counts and multiple accused, that you do not allow, if you reach a finding of guilt on any count against any accused, if you do that, and I do not know how you will finish up, but if you do that, you do not allow what I call the ‘overflow factor’ to work. Do not let a finding on one count overflow into another count or a finding in relation to one accused overflow into another accused.” 
        
       
      
    48 Although the appellant acknowledges that his Honour was careful to remind the jury to approach each count separately, the essence of the complaint is that the trial judge failed to warn the jury that they may consider that their finding as to the credibility of the complainant in relation to one count might legitimately affect their assessment of his credibility on other counts. 
     
      
    49 It is submitted that the jury should have been told that if they were unable to accept Mr Summerville on any count this may legitimately be considered when assessing the credibility of his evidence on any other count. 
     
      
    50 This Court considered this matter in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 where the Chief Justice said at 122: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may appear to be obvious that a reasonable doubt about one aspect of a complainant’s evidence ought to be taken into account when assessing that witness’s evidence on other matters. However, there have been a significant number of cases in which courts of criminal appeal have acted on the basis that the jury may have failed to do so.  
        
       
       
        
        In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence with respect to any count. 
        
       
       
        
        Some form of direction assisting the jury in this respect should be given, to employ the terminology found in  
        Kilby 
         and in  
        R v Davies 
         ‘as a general rule’.” 
        
       
      
    51 Notwithstanding these remarks, the Chief Justice pointed out that a failure to give such a direction would not necessarily be fatal and no specific words were required. 
     
      
    52 The major difficulty that the submission must face in the present case is that, although count one was effectively a “word against word” case, this was not the position in relation to the other counts. For this reason the jury’s acquittal of the appellant on the first count can be explained by the jury concluding that the evidence did not reach the requisite standard. This does not carry with it a finding that the complainant’s credit was seriously flawed, but merely a finding that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. However, in relation to the other counts, as I have indicated, there was corroborating evidence of varying degrees, which the jury was entitled to accept and which could provide a basis for the conviction irrespective of the view which the jury may have formed as to the state of the evidence, including that of Mr Summerville, in relation to count one. Of course, if the jury did not believe Mr Summerville’s account on these other matters the prosecution would fail. In that sense, his Honour’s direction was undoubtedly correct. However, because this was not a case where Mr Summerville’s evidence stood alone on the other counts, although a direction may have been preferable, I do not believe the trial miscarried because a direction was not given (Markuleski at 102). 
     
      
    53 It must be remembered that the charges involved an alleged sequence of events which occurred over a matter of weeks, all relating to attempts by the appellant to retrieve the debt that he said was owed to him by the appellant. It is plain that the jury acted on the instructions to look at each charge separately. They acquitted on count 1, but commonsense dictates that they must have come to an overall assessment of Mr Summerville’s credibility having regard to his evidence in relation to all of the counts. It could not be otherwise. 
     
      
    54 The acquittal on count 1 is adequately explained by the lack of corroborating evidence. Since no complaint was made in relation to his Honour’s direction on this aspect at the trial, rule 4 applies. I would refuse leave in relation to this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three – The verdicts of the jury in counts two, three and four are unreasonable having regard to the evidence s 6(1)  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912. 
       
      
    55 Under this ground of appeal the appellant emphasises, as I have already identified, that the case was left to the jury on the basis that the prosecution depended upon the credibility and reliability of Mr Summerville. It is submitted that there were a number of matters, each of which was raised by the trial judge in his summing up, which could be the basis for a finding that the evidence of Mr Summerville was unreliable. The appellant identifies the following matters: 
     
      
    · His conviction for cultivating cannabis some ten years prior; 
     
      
    · That he gave four statements to the police, each one making further allegations; 
     
      
    · That he forgot very important elements in the first, second and third statements; 
     
      
    · He gave evidence in chief which contradicted evidence he gave at the committal hearing; 
     
      
    · His evidence was inconsistent; 
     
      
    · He admitted that he told lies in significant respects. 
     
      
    56 His Honour’s directions included the following discussion of these matters: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first one I will mention is the first in point of time. About ten years ago, and I will get counsel to correct me if I am wrong, Mr Summerville himself was convicted of a crime which resulted in his being sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment. Now it was his first offence and it may occur to you that for someone to get 12 months imprisonment for his first offence, it was not an insignificant matter, because our common experience tells us that people often go on committing a number of offences before they ever get a prison sentence. They get fines and warnings and bonds and all sorts of things. 
        
       
       
        
        The crimes in this case were crimes under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act and they involved the cultivation of cannabis and the supply of cannabis. Otherwise he is a person with no convictions. And that was 10 years ago. So I want to balance this for you. I do not want to be partisan in this at all. But it was a crime of significance for the reasons I have mentioned. And as you know, the cultivation of cannabis is not something you do on the spur of the moment. I can go out on the street and get into a fight with someone and punch him and suddenly I have committed a crime. I have got a criminal record. You do not get that – and people can say, ‘Look he is a good chap, he needs an anger management course, he’s got a psychological problem’ and so on and so forth and the courts can take that into account. But when you commit a crime involving the cultivation of cannabis, there is planning, there is getting the seed, there is finding a place to do it, a place to conceal it, the cultivation and the looking after the crop and so on. It is not a spur of the moment crime. It is not a crime of passion or a crime of anger. So you have to consider whether the fact that he has that conviction, perhaps coupled with other things that I may mention, affect his reliability as a witness. You have to consider that. I am not telling you that it does. I am saying you have to consider it when you are considering its reliability. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition to that, there are matters which counsel has already brought to your attention in considerable detail. And it is not really possible for me, although the Act envisages, I will mention them in some way to you, but I think I can ask you to remember the very eloquent addresses of Mr King and Mr Kelly and I do not mean any disparagement to Mr Simpson, but he did not address that particular topic. That was not part of his function in the division of labour that was involved in counsels’ addresses. But he said, it was put to you that he said that he had good recollection skills and good memory and so on and yet it took him, I think up to four statements, to get some of the important elements of the story across to the police. And it is suggested to you that that may indicate, and I emphasise the word may, it may indicate that he is not as reliable as he says he is when he is asked whether he has got a good memory and whether he is telling the truth. Because if he could forget such important things, at a time almost very soon after the events had occurred and some very important things that went into the second and third statements that were not in the first, or in the second, with relation to the third, then you may either say his memory is not as good as he says it is, or alternatively he has actually fabricated some things to prop up his story as time has gone along. Now that may not be the case. And again I emphasise, I am not saying it is, but I have to warn you to consider that when you are considering his reliability. 
        
       
       
        
        There are quite a number of other things and I do not think counsel want me to go right through them. They have covered them in their addresses. I give you another example, I see one right in front of me here on notes that I have in front of me, that in examination in chief, that’s in questions being asked by the Crown of Mr Summerville, he said that the motor of the brown Toyota station wagon was not running at the particular time that he was referring to it. At the committal proceeding he said it was running. Now that is a small thing. But what counsel is trying to do is suggest that because small those inconsistencies may be, that when the whole list of inconsistencies that counsel referred to are taken into account, they suggest an overall unreliability as to detail. 
        
       
       
        
        There is another matter I think that I should mention. It sounds as though I am attacking him and I am not. I have to bring it to your attention. He did admit in the witness box himself, that he told lies. He told lies in significant respects, in particular I recall he said he told lies to his lady friend. She said that she did not think he ever told her lies and she would be very surprised if he did, but he did because he confessed to it here in court. Now the question you have to ask yourself is – I am not talking about little white lies that we all have to tell. You say to someone, ‘You’re looking very well today’ and you know they look terrible, but you’re not going to say, ‘Gee you’re looking terrible today’, are you? So you have told a lie. A lie is not always bad. A lie might be good. You might have to say something to someone out of kindness that amounts to a lie. 
        
       
       
        
        But when you tell a lie to gain an advantage, that is when a lie is bad and if a person, and if you think that Mr Summerville has lied from time to time to his girlfriend and other people, to gain some advantage for himself to get them to do something that he wants them to do or to curry favour in some way with them for some selfish reason, then you might ask yourself, might not that be the sort of person who, in such a serious situation as he found himself in and found himself in in this case, be prepared to lie again for the very same reason. 
        
       
       
        
        Now I have given you that warning and all I ask you to do is to exercise caution in determining whether to accept his evidence and exercise caution in deciding what weight to give to it. That is all and I think you do that anyhow because you must realise that the whole case turns on Mr Summerville. As someone said, it is all right to point out that there are, in a sense, little corroborating features around the place that may make his evidence in some respects more likely than it might otherwise have been.” 
        
       
      
    57 Although, as the appellant emphasises, the trial judge identified for the jury the significance of Mr Summerville’s evidence, the Crown case was not confined to that evidence in relation to counts two, three and four. In relation to those counts, the Crown case was in various respects supported by the evidence of Lynelle Baker and Jade English; by the evidence of Dr Hapangama in respect of possible causes of Mr Summerville’s injuries; by the finding of Mr Summerville’s blood at 14 Allworth Street, Kurri Kurri; by the finding of Mr Summerville’s papers bearing finger prints of the appellant in a room in the appellant’s parents’ house and the finding of his mobile telephone and of a paper bearing the telephone number of Jade English in the bedroom of the appellant at that house. I have previously referred to each of these matters. 
     
      
    58 The appellant points to a number of evidentiary difficulties in the Crown case. They include the failure to find the mallet allegedly used to strike Mr Summerville; the lack of evidence corroborating Mr Summerville’s account that another person held him down when he was struck by the appellant; the fact that medical evidence was given that the injuries suffered by Mr Summerville could have been caused by a blow from the appellant’s fist, being the version of events which the appellant gave at the trial. 
     
      
    59 The appellant also emphasises that, although Mr Summerville alleges he was threatened with a gun, there is no evidence to corroborate that allegation and no guns were ever recovered from the appellant. Furthermore, to answer the suggestion that any guns and the mallet may have been disposed of, the appellant emphasises that marijuana was located at his premises when they were searched by the police. It is said that if the appellant was “covering his tracks” the marijuana would also have been secreted. 
     
      
    60 The difficulty with the latter argument is that the appellant explained the marijuana as having been given to him by Mr Summerville as a payment for the damage to the car. Whether or not this was true, the story would be more believable if marijuana was in fact discovered at his premises. 
     
      
    61 It must also be remembered that Mr Summerville says that the original debt arose from a transaction where he purchased marijuana from the appellant. Given that he was accordingly confessing to a crime it would be somewhat surprising if it were not true. Furthermore, explanations, or at least explanations that did not involve confessing to a criminal act for the friction between them, would obviously have been available. 
     
      
    62 On this matter his Honour told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a section of the Evidence Act which requires me to give you this direction. I have to advise you – I have to direct you that the evidence of Mr Summerville may be unreliable because it is the evidence of a person who you may find on the evidence might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings. You know that Mr Summerville himself said this all started, he said, it all started, so it is his evidence, when he went to buy cannabis from Daniel Williams. Now that is a criminal activity. To buy half a pound of cannabis from someone is a criminal activity. Some of us might think it should not be, I am not suggesting I do, but some people in the community and some very reputable people think it should not be, but it is now against the law and it is a serious crime, punishable by imprisonment under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. So this all started with an involvement, if you accept the evidence, by Summerville and Daniel Williams together in a criminal enterprise, namely the buying and selling of cannabis. This section specifically relates to such a situation. I will just read it to you because the words are fairly clear. I have to warn you that the evidence of Summerville may be unreliable because it is the evidence of a witness who might reasonably be supposed, it is a matter for you, to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings. And indeed I think this is one area where I can speak a bit more strongly. If you accept – if you do not accept Summerville the case is over. It pivots on him, you know that. I will say more about that later. 
        
       
       
        
        But if you do accept him then you must accept that he was criminally involved in a criminal enterprise at the very threshold of this matter, in fact the very matter that gave rise to these events that give rise to this case. So I have given you that direction. I have given you the warning required by s 165 of the Evidence Act. 
        
       
       
        
        The Act requires me to give you, on the request of counsel, a further warning and indeed it relates to the same witness. I am requested to warn you and I am required to warn you when the request is made, that the evidence of the complainant, that is to say Summerville, may be unreliable and I am to inform you what may cause it to be unreliable. And I am to warn you of the need for caution in determining whether to accept his evidence and what weight to give to that evidence. This is not to tell you you should not rely on his evidence, it is far from it. This is simply a caution that I am required to give you, a warning. It involves your looking very scrupulously and carefully at his evidence before you rely on it, if you are going to, that is all it requires. It is not to say I am telling you his evidence is unreliable so do not rely on it. I am not doing that I am saying it may be unreliable for the following reasons. You consider them. You might say those reasons do not affect us. We rely on him implicitly, or you may not. I do not know what you will find. But there are a number of things.” 
        
       
      
    63 The appellant also draws attention to the evidence of Mr Summerville’s banking activities. At about the relevant time, on 12 April 2001, he opened an account with a deposit of $5. The account was closed by the bank on 17 May 2001 by which stage cheques had been written on it for amounts, which the account could not meet. There was in evidence a cheque allegedly drawn on this account and said to be in Mr Summerville’s handwriting in the sum of $4600. Mr Summerville denied drawing the cheque and says it is a forgery, although there was evidence from his wife that she recognised the handwriting as Mr Summerville’s. 
     
      
    64 This matter raised issues of significance in relation to Mr Summerville’s credit. The fact that Mr Summerville’s wife indicated that the handwriting on the cheque was Mr Summerville’s was a matter requiring careful evaluation by the jury. However, it was not central to the charges, which were in essence that a debt was owed to the appellant that he sought to recover by the use of force. To my mind, none of the matters complained of, even if resolved favourably to the appellant, would lead to a conclusion that the jury was not able to accept the Crown case. 
     
      
    65 The significance of the jury’s role in a criminal trial has been emphasised on many occasions. Given the conflicts in some of the evidence, the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses would be considerable in this case. As was pointed out in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
      
    66 To my mind, each of the matters raised by the appellant were appropriately put before the jury for consideration. His Honour was careful to warn the jury about the matters which the defence said undermined Mr Summerville’s credibility. With the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, the jury returned guilty verdicts on counts 2, 3 and 4. In these circumstances I am not persuaded that there is any reason for this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    67 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    68 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    69 HOWIE J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    70 LATHAM J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

      2005/1367 - REGINA v A.B. 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: AB, you have pleaded guilty to an indictment charging that you were accessory before the fact to the murder of Dominic Li. As such you are in the category of what was once described as a principal in the third degree and, by Act of Parliament, you are liable to the same punishment as any principal offender. The available punishment extends to imprisonment for life. You ask me, and I shall, take into account on sentence pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, a further offence of possessing a firearm, namely a .32 Browning semi automatic pistol, contrary to the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    2 There is an agreed Statement of Facts and I draw largely from it to recount this summary. 
     
      
    3 It is necessary to identify and describe the participation of others in circumstances which led to the murder in order to place your participation into context.  
     
      
    4 The findings I make are, of course, for the purpose of imposing sentence on you and the establishment of culpability of some others in the context of charges against them remains for determination. 
     
      
    5 Yong Kee Tan, amongst other things, operated a restaurant called the Warung Bandung. His other activities included dealing in illicit drugs. In that aspect of his activities there was an association with a person described as his boss, Emil Chang.  
     
      
    6 As well as for other reasons, you were known to Tan and Chang as the brother of a man who installed some airconditioning in the restaurant. 
     
      
    7 The victim Dominic Li was a partner in a firm of accountants which performed professional services for Tan in respect of legitimate business enterprises, which included the arrangement of student visas. 
     
      
    8 Tan approached Mr Li for assistance in investing a large amount of money which he had available. I am satisfied that this money was obtained by illicit activity, and it was Tan and Chang’s desire to, as it is usually termed, launder it. Mr Li declined the approach and told Tan that he had no expertise as an investment adviser but recommended his brother-in-law Philip Ma.  
     
      
    9 During 2002 Tan gave Ma several hundred thousands of dollars, which it was apparently intended to launder by passing through the Crown Casino in Melbourne, ultimately acquiring cheques drawn by the Casino in lieu of cash initially used in gaming. Ma lost a considerable amount of this money and went into hiding. 
     
      
    10 Chang and Tan were unable to locate Ma, and, on their assumption that Li would know his whereabouts, decided to have Mr Li attacked as an indirect way of forcing Ma out of hiding or learning his whereabouts. Mr Li had told Tan that he had had nothing to do with the investment transactions, as was the case, after he had introduced Ma.  
     
      
    11 Chang and Tan determined that the attack on Mr Li would consist of splashing acid on his face in order to produce significant disfigurement. 
     
      
    12 Tan needed to find someone to execute this intention. Some weeks after you were released from gaol at the end of September 2002 he contacted you and asked you whether you would pour acid on the face of a victim and cause intended disfigurement. You declined to do this but told Tan that you could introduce a friend who might be interested in doing such a thing. You introduced Tan to Maua Sua and subsequently became aware that he had agreed to do what Tan wanted for a fee of $10,000. 
     
      
    13 I accept that you had been told by Tan that the intended victim had defrauded him. This was untrue, although you did not know it. I also accept that your knowledge of the enterprise was that it was intended to cause grievous bodily harm in the manner which I have described rather than the death of the victim. Your knowledge, to say the least, extended to intention to engage in horrific conduct. 
     
      
    14 Although you had declined to participate in the physical execution of the attack, you continued your involvement by holding the sum of $10,000, which was the payment agreed to be made by Tan. 
     
      
    15 Other activity by you included locating a hardware store from which acid could be purchased and passing that information to Sua. I am satisfied that you also persuaded your friend Dax Satorre to provide his car and act as driver to take Sua and his associate Richard Nimmo (who had been recruited to help him) to the scene.  
     
      
    16 In the proceedings, I sought clarification of a possible contradiction between the agreed facts and your part in Satorre’s involvement. The chronicle of circumstances which can be derived from all the material placed before me establishes to the necessary standard that you were the link whereby he came to participate. 
     
      
    17 On Friday 13 December 2002 Satorre met Sua and Nimmo at a garage where they transferred from their car into his. He drove them to the home of the victim where he was in residence with his wife and fourteen year old son.  
     
      
    18 At an earlier point a video film had been taken in order to identify the premises. At your suggestion Sua and Nimmo went to the door carrying a large envelope, pretending to be couriers. Those two approached the door at about 7.30 am. Satorre remained nearby in his car.  
     
      
    19 Dominic Li’s wife answered the door and called for her husband. When Mr Li answered the call, a pistol was produced. You had lent this pistol to Sua for use by him and Nimmo in the assault. It was later returned to you. That is the pistol to which the offence relates which you have asked me to take into account under the Form 1 procedure. 
     
      
    20 Both Mr Li and his wife were forced to the ground of their front porch and Mr Li was struck on the back of the head with the pistol. He was then turned onto his back and restrained by one of the two offenders whilst the other poured hydrochloric acid into his mouth. The pour into the mouth also included spillage of the chemical which caused severe burns and permanently blinded the victim.  
     
      
    21 After they had done this, Sua and Nimmo fled to the waiting car and Satorre drove them from the area.  
     
      
    22 Dominic Li’s fourteen year old son attempted to rescue his father by pouring water over his face to dilute the acid which was steaming and bubbling as it lifted paint on the porch floor as well as causing ghastly injuries to Mr Li.  
     
      
    23 He was taken to Concord Hospital where, among other injuries, his permanent blindness was diagnosed. His pain level was such that medical treatment included an induced coma, however his life could not be saved and he died on Thursday 2 January 2003.  
     
      
    24 Some of the information which I have related has been able to be derived from the product of lawfully installed listening devices where you yourself spoke about various incidents of your involvement. 
     
      
    25 After the attack, Sua came to you to collect the payment which you were holding, which was passed to him less a sum of $1,000 as a fee to be paid to Satorre. 
     
      
    26 Insofar as you might be described as providing services for Tan, it is conceded by the Crown that there is no evidence that you profited financially. It is submitted on your behalf that you did not participate for reward, and in the financial sense, I accept that that is so. I do not accept, however, that you acted without an eye to advantage. It was acknowledged by your counsel that your assistance to Tan might be interpreted as being motivated by a desire to ingratiate yourself with a person who was a significant supplier of drugs to you. I am satisfied that you were so motivated and I do not regard it as a matter of great weight for reduction of your culpability that you did not seek or receive any money for your participation. 
     
      
    27 I do not need to elaborate upon the appalling fatal culmination of the series of events which I have described, and in which you have played a pivotal role, to define the high degree of seriousness of this offence.  
     
      
    28 I have said elsewhere in dealing with contract killing that such behaviour has the potential to attract the maximum sentence and, contracting to cause a gross form of grievous bodily harm, which in fact results in causation of death must come near to being in that category of seriousness. The gravity of your criminal conduct should not be underestimated.  
     
      
    29 Before turning to other matters I should refer to the circumstance that one participant, Dax Satorre, has already been dealt with following his plea of guilty to murder. Sua, Nimmo and Tan are awaiting trial and there are reports that Chang, who was arrested in Thailand, has died there.  
     
      
    30 It is acknowledged by the Crown and submitted on your behalf that I should pay regard to how Satorre was dealt with in setting a sentence for you.  
     
      
    31 He and you are in the same situation of offering a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. He has undertaken to assist the Crown in the prosecution of other offenders. It would appear that the evidence which Satorre would be available to give would be most valuable to the Crown in the prosecution of Sua, but of less certain value in the prosecution of Nimmo, whom Satorre saw only on the one occasion, and he apparently had no relevant contact with Tan.  
     
      
    32 I have briefly referred to Satorre’s involvement as the driver of the car and the recipient of $1,000 for his activity. It might be mentioned in passing that the receipt of this sum by him was short-lived as it was used immediately to repay debt in respect of drugs supplied by you.  
     
      
    33 The offer of cooperation by Satorre has led to his being kept on protection in custody and this situation is likely to extend for a considerable period, if not the whole of his incarceration. 
     
      
    34 The assessment by Studdert J who dealt with Satorre was that his participation called for a head sentence of imprisonment for thirty two years. This was reduced by half, which his Honour disclosed as involving a discount of 30 percent for the plea of guilty, the contrition harboured by the offender and past assistance, and a further 20 percent for promised assistance not yet given. In the result Satorre received a sentence comprising a non parole period of twelve years and a total term of sixteen years. I note that I have been informed that an application for leave to appeal against sentence by him is pending. 
     
      
    35 I turn to some subjective matters. You were born on 1 April 1969. You were married and have four children to that marriage. You also engaged in a relationship with a young woman for a time and there is a further child from that now ended relationship. You are a native of the Philippines Republic and have permanent residency in Australia. You arrived here when you were aged 22. Some tertiary qualification was not recognized and you did not complete a local engineering diploma course owing to incarceration for drug offending. Your qualifications are confirmed by tendered documentation. You worked at various relatively unskilled occupations until 1997 since when you have been unemployed significantly owing to your substance abuse. 
     
      
    36 You have prior convictions dating back to 1996. In 2001 you were sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months with a non parole period of eleven months for supplying a prohibited drug. It is disturbing to note that, having regard to the present Form 1 offence, there was on that occasion taken into account on another Form 1, an offence of possessing an unregistered firearm which was a pistol. Since the commission of the murder you have been sentenced for ongoing supply of prohibited drugs to imprisonment for three years with a non parole period of one year and nine months. On that sentence your specified release date was 21 January 2005.  
     
      
    37 It is an aggravating feature of the present offence that it was committed while you were subject to parole, indeed, as I have related, you responded to Tan’s request to assist him to find someone to carry out his macabre intent within weeks of your release from custody. The circumstances do not provide a sound basis for estimating that you have good rehabilitation prospects. 
     
      
    38 Some favourable indication however can be derived from your willingness to assist in the prosecution of other participants. I have read the affidavit of comfort with its annexure, sworn on 14 September 2005 by Superintendent Wallace and note the undertaking signed by you on 16 September. I accept that, as a consequence of your promise of assistance and its anticipated fulfilment, it is likely that you will spend a considerable proportion and possibly the whole of your custody in protection, which is likely to be in some respects more onerous and with less opportunities than it would be if you served your sentence in general population.  
     
      
    39 Your counsel stated that you had heard that your life was in danger. Your capacity to testify about the participation of those yet to be tried makes it credible that you would be in fear. I cannot determine the existence, source or detail of any threat but that you would harbour such apprehension no doubt adds to the subjective burdens of being in custody. 
     
      
    40 I will take the foregoing matters into account in your favour in assessing sentence. 
     
      
    41 I accept that your offer of assistance is an indication of remorse as is your prompt plea of guilty. These matters will operate also to your benefit, the latter having practical benefit to the community and to witnesses in avoiding the necessity for your trial.  
     
      
    42 I have read the contents of your letter expressing apology and contrition. Through your counsel, you have emphasized that, in particular, your offer of assistance is motivated not just by anticipated discount to sentence but a desire to redeem yourself to the extent of acting honourably. I do not consider that the prospect of discount is ignored by you but I accept that your motive includes a somewhat nobler element. 
     
      
    43 It must be said however, that apart from those matters there is little that can be weighed in your favour in sentence assessment. 
     
      
    44 A major focus of submissions on your behalf has been the issue of parity between yourself and Satorre, neither of you being, as are Tan and Chang in a sense, principal contractors, nor as are Sua and Nimmo, being involved in actual physical execution of the killing. It is convenient to deal with aspects of your culpability in the context of some comparisons and contrasts adverted to on the issue of parity. 
     
      
    45 I recapitulate in brief your actions. You recruited Sua for the known purpose of seriously injuring the face of the victim by splashing him with acid. This treatment was to be meted out because you believed he had, in some way cheated Tan. You supplied a pistol to be used in the offence. You made arrangement for Satorre to provide transport. You scouted for a supply of acid and told Sua from whence it could be had. You held the money to be paid for the actual commission of the crime, and when it had been completed, acted, as a sort of paymaster. You received no financial reward, however I have already commented upon your indirect benefit of ingratiating yourself with a supplier of illicit drug to you.  
     
      
    46 Satorre’s involvement was, for reward of $1,000, to supply his vehicle and himself as driver, to transport Sua and Nimmo to and from their car and the scene of the crime. 
     
      
    47 On the facts of your respective involvements I assess your overall culpability as greater than that of Satorre. 
     
      
    48 Satorre had a prior record described by the Crown in the proceedings against him as minor. He had not previously been committed to serve actual custody although he had, on an occasion received a suspended sentence. As I have observed, you had been released after custody to parole, which remained current, only a matter of weeks before commencing your involvement which led to the murder of Mr Li. 
     
      
    49 In terms of prior record Satorre would have a call for greater leniency than you. 
     
      
    50 Each of you is in the same situation of having offered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    51 Each of you has promised assistance and, in respect of interview with and supply of information to police, been of assistance in the past. In the context of intended prosecution of other offenders it is acknowledged by the Crown that, on one view, the assistance that you can offer is of greater value than that which can be offered by Satorre. That is a view which, for the reasons earlier adumbrated, especially your capacity to inculpate Tan, I would take. Indeed, in a written submission the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor accepted that assistance now being offered by you is of significantly greater value than that offered by Satorre. Ultimately the Crown submitted that although you have pleaded guilty to a different charge from Satorre, your culpability is able to be compared. I do not take that as a concession or submission that your sentences should be the same. 
     
      
    52 On your behalf it is submitted that there should be little distinction in the level of criminality and, given the added value of potential assistance, you should therefore receive a sentence less than Satorre or, alternatively at most, a sentence of the same order. 
     
      
    53 Whilst I have described the different objective activity of each of you and Satorre, it was submitted that your criminality should be assessed with a reduction by reason of your impaired mental state consequent upon your long term drug abuse. I note the opinion of Mr Ashkar that drug taking impairs your thinking and alters your personality. However in his report of 16 August 2005 he mentions that your claimed symptoms do not satisfy the criteria for anxiety disorder nor did you then manifest depressed mood or thought disorder. I also note your apparent consciousness of what you had got yourself into in various conversations captured by listening devices and in what you stated to police in interview with them. 
     
      
    54 It is claimed that you did not appreciate the seriousness of your actions because your drug taking made you befuddled. I was supplied with documentation concerning the study of the effects of the drug known commonly as “ice” of which you were a partaker. 
     
      
    55 I have read the general information tendered concerning the freebase form of methamphetamine, commonly called “ice”, of which you were a user. In gauging the effect on you at the relevant time near the commission of offence, I place weight on your obvious appreciation of what you were involved in and your coherent later observations by which, among other things, you sought to minimize your role and dissociate yourself from the cruel conduct of those whose aims you had served and whom you had assisted by recruitment of people to carry them out. It is the effect of any partaking of “ice” by you which is relevant rather than what is canvassed in publications. As is noted in one of them, the effects of drug vary from person to person dependent upon many factors. 
     
      
    56 The issue is how did the drug affect you. In evidence you agreed with the Crown Prosecutor that taking the drug kept you awake, would make you feel good, did not make you feel aggressive and, indeed, made you feel in a more loving and happy mood. 
     
      
    57 I note the evidence of Mr Riley and I have no reservation about his bona fides but I regard his views as understandably skewed by his concerns about you, a long term acquaintance, for whom he, in charity, cares whereas objectivity does not put you and your actions into such favourable light. 
     
      
    58 I am not persuaded that your mental state was impaired by drug taking to a degree that it has become a factor which should reduce the level of your criminality. 
     
      
    59 The Crown has accepted that murder resulting from intention to do grievous bodily harm is not as serious as murder involving the intention to kill. I would agree with that as a general proposition but note that this was no impulse crime but a premeditated and planned infliction of a particularly gruesome form of grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    60 I would assess an appropriate sentence for your crime, taking into account the not minor matter on the Form 1 at 36 years imprisonment. Given the date of offence it is appropriate to make that initial assessment of head sentence. 
     
      
    61 I would reduce that by half to accommodate any entitlement to consideration for the plea of guilty, both for practical and subjective matters pertaining to the pleas and for other mitigatory matters and particularly the offer of future assistance. I specify that one half of the discount (25 percent of the head sentence) is referrable in my assessment to that offer of future assistance. 
     
      
    62 I am not persuaded that by reason of special circumstances there should be a departure from the proportion of non parole period to total term which is provided in the sentencing legislation. 
     
      
    63 I do not consider that the discernible difference in final sentence received by you and that received by Satorre would reasonably give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on your part, having regard to the matters which I have canvassed. 
     
      
    64 The non parole period of your current sentence for ongoing supply of a prohibited drug expired, as I have said, on 22 January 2005 and I find that it is appropriate to commence your sentence for this crime on that date. 
     
      
    65 AB, for your crime for being an accessory before the fact to the murder of Dominic Li, and taking into account the offence of possessing an unlicensed firearm, you are sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen years with a non parole period of thirteen years and six months, each to commence on 22 January 2005. The non parole period will expire on 21 July 2018, which date is specified as the earliest date of your eligibility for release to parole.

     Judgment

    2 BARR J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: On 1 November 2004 the applicant was arraigned before a jury on an indictment containing nine counts of sexual assault offences against a child. On the third day of the trial the applicant asked to be re-arraigned on a fresh indictment alleging three counts of sexual intercourse upon the complainant. He pleaded guilty to each of those offences and was ultimately sentenced by Judge Marien SC (the Judge) to sentences totalling imprisonment for five years with an overall minimum period of imprisonment of three years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of those sentences. 
     
      
    4 The three offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were identical in form and were each worded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Between 23 April 2030 April 2000, at Rose Meadow in the State of New South Wales, had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] a child then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 12 years of age. 
         
        
       
      Each of the counts on the indictment alleged an offence contrary to s 66C(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       for which a maximum penalty is prescribed of eight years imprisonment. The first and third counts each related to an incident in which the applicant had the complainant perform fellatio upon him and the second count related to an act of penetration of the complainant's vagina by the applicant's penis. 
       
      
    5 In respect of the first count the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 20 April 2005 and to expire on 19 October 2006. In respect of the second count the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 20 April 2006 and expiring on 19 April 2008. In respect of the third count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years commencing on 20 June 2007 with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 19 December 2008, the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. 
     
      
    6 A statement of facts was presented to the court for the purpose of sentencing the applicant. They revealed that the complainant was aged 17 years at the time of sentence and 12 years of age of the time of the offences. The applicant was aged 28 at the time of offences and was married with two children. The complainant and the applicant knew each other and had previously lived in close proximity to one another. The complainant first disclosed to police that the applicant had sexually assaulted her on 23 September 2002. She was reinterviewed on 12 August 2003 and made further complaints of sexual abuse by the applicant. The applicant was arrested on 22 August 2003 and remained on bail until sentenced by the judge on 20 April 2005. 
     
      
    7 On Easter Sunday, 23 April 2000, the complainant was at the applicant's home in order to celebrate the eighth birthday of the applicant's daughter. While the complainant was in the kitchen washing a glass she had been using, the applicant approached her from behind and pressed himself onto her back. He then reached around and felt the complainant in the area of her vagina above her clothing. When another person entered the kitchen, the applicant stopped touching the complainant and she left the room. 
     
      
    8 Later in the day the complainant went to the home of a neighbour where the applicant was also present. The complainant, the applicant and two others were in the lounge room of the premises. When the other two persons left the room, the complainant and the applicant were sitting at the dining table. The applicant kissed the complainant on her mouth. The complainant moved back but the applicant placed his right hand on her left leg moving it up to place it under her top and felt her breast underneath her bra. He asked the complainant if she wanted ""to go down"" on him but she refused. The applicant told her she was hard to get and then undid his jeans and exposed his penis that was flaccid at the time. While masturbating himself, he kept asking her ""to go down"" on him. The complainant went to stand up but he took her wrist and placed her in a kneeling position on the ground. She then proceeded to suck his penis for a couple of minutes, while the applicant kept his hand on the back of her neck in a non-forceful way. On hearing footsteps the applicant placed his penis back into his jeans and sat back down at the dining table. Other persons then entered the room and a short time later the complainant and the applicant left. This act of fellatio gave rise to the first count on the indictment. 
     
      
    9 Some time in the week between the 23rd and 30th of April 2002 the complainant went to a friend's home in the neighbourhood but found that she was not at home. As she was expected shortly, the complainant waited outside the house. The applicant beckoned to her from his home across the road. He asked her to come inside to see his new computer. She went with him to the upstairs main bedroom where the applicant showed her the computer. She told him that she had to go but the applicant placed her on to the double bed. He kissed the side of her face and lifted up the top she was wearing and kissed her breast. He then placed his hands down her pants and inserted his fingers into her vagina moving them in and out. He did this for some time before he lowered the complainant's pants and inserted his penis into her vagina. This act of intercourse gave rise to the second count on the indictment. 
     
      
    10 The applicant and the complainant then left the room and went downstairs. He went to the front door and locked it and then placed the complainant on her knees and lowered his pants to expose his erect penis. He then asked the complainant to suck his penis and she did. After a while the applicant removed his penis from her mouth and then walked off in the direction of the laundry. He returned a short time later and told the complainant not to tell anyone. She then returned home and showered. This act of fellatio gave rise to the third count on the indictment. 
     
      
    11 At the time of these offences the complainant's father was seriously ill. The complainant stated that she did not disclose these offences to her family at this time because she did not want to cause them any further stress. However she did tell a friend. 
     
      
    12 On 26 May 2000 the complainant's mother found a letter from the applicant to the complainant in her daughter's bedroom. The letter indicated that the applicant was in love with the complainant and asked her to be patient, as the day would come when they would be together. The mother confronted the applicant about the letter the next day. He admitted writing the letter and said, ""I wrote it just to make her feel better"". A short time later the mother contacted DOCS and attended a police station to make a statement. Apparently the matter was not investigated further either by DOCS or the police. 
     
      
    13 In 2002 a school counsellor notified police but the applicant was not arrested and charged until 22 August 2003. The applicant was committed for trial on 2 April 2004 and a trial was listed for hearing in the District Court on 21 June 2004. On 23 June 2004 the Crown made an application to amend the indictment to include fresh allegations by the complainant. The application was granted but the jury was discharged and the trial adjourned to 1 November 2004. During the trial the Crown had made an offer to the applicant that it would accept pleas of guilty to charges in respect of the two allegations of fellatio. This offer was not accepted. 
     
      
    14 There was a Victim Impact Statement before the court from the complainant. The Judge summarised the contents of that statement as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ………. following the offences she feels hopelessness, sadness, guilt and frustration. She says she turned to self-harm for relief. She said that trust is a big issue for her and that she finds it hard to form new relationships, especially with males. She states that she was placed on anti-depressants in 2002 and went to counselling to help her overcome the effect of the offences and self-harming and talk about her thoughts and feelings. She says she still has nightmares about what happened to her and that she is hoping that over time they will get less frequent. 
         
         
        
       
      The Judge was satisfied that the offending conduct ""at least played a very significant role in causing psychological harm to the victim and deterioration in her academic record”. 
       
      
    15 The applicant was born on 27 November 1972, being 32 years of age at the date of sentencing. He has a minor criminal record that the Judge disregarded for the purposes of sentencing him. There was a psychological report prepared by Emma Collins. It discloses the following. The applicant is of Aboriginal background. His parents separated when he was very young and he had no further contact with his father. His mother has described his father as being vindictive towards the children when he was intoxicated. The family moved from Western Australia to Queensland where they lived until the applicant was aged 10. The applicant had a ""discordant relationship” with his stepfather who he said physically abused his stepchildren particularly when he was drunk. He reported that he sustained broken bones as a result of the abuse. He would leave the house and sleep near the river on these occasions. As a result of stealing food and blankets in order to live, he has a juvenile record for breaking into property. 
     
      
    16 The applicant left home about the age of 14 and lived on the streets for six months before he went to live with his mother and an uncle. He says that he was also abused while living there. He returned to Sydney approximately 6 months later and met his current partner. He lived with her and friends before they gained their own property about 17 years ago. The applicant had a consistent work history mainly in manual positions. At the time of sentencing he had been working for a roof frame cutting company for about five weeks. He had been involved in a de facto relationship from the age of 16 years and had been married about five years at the date of sentencing. He does not use drugs and drinks alcohol socially. 
     
      
    17 The applicant reported to Ms Collins that he was sexually assaulted when he was in gaol on remand for a period of six weeks on a charge of malicious damage. He said that he was physically abused, victimised and was raped by other inmates. He was ultimately acquitted of the charge for which he was in custody. On occasions the applicant takes antidepressant medication but had no other relevant medical history. 
     
      
    18 The applicant told Ms Collins that he had spoken with the complainant prior to the offence and felt some kind of ""bond"" with her because she had a similar history to his own and he was able to identify with her. He said that he did not understand how he was able to allow it to progress to intercourse. Ms Collins found that the applicant appeared regretful and showed some indicators of empathy in relation to the impact of his conduct upon the complainant. However, she also thought he revealed poor insight into the offending and there was some degree of minimisation of the offence. 
     
      
    19 Ms Collins reported that the applicant presented with considerable psychological disturbance and had difficulties as a result of his previous traumatic experiences. He was vulnerable to depression and had poor social skills. She stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In considering all of [the applicant's] vulnerabilities given his history, it is clear that he suffered a traumatic reaction to a sexual assault he experienced whilst in gaol. He appears to have developed post-traumatic stress disorder and depression as a result, and this incident further in exacerbation of his interpersonal difficulties. [The applicant] impresses as becoming increasingly suspicious and avoidant of others and reports clear difficulties relating to others. The offence appears to represent his interpersonal difficulties, and not understanding boundaries set around age-appropriate sexual behaviour, but was also affected by his own sexual abuse and general psychosocial vulnerabilities. Intensive treatment needs to occur around these areas by way of a sex offender therapy program, in order to reduce the risk of recidivism and help treat [the applicant's] underlying psychopathology. 
        
       
      
    20 The psychologist indicated that she had significant concerns with regards to the applicant's ability to cope with incarceration, given the abuse he endured when in custody. She reported that the applicant express “significant distress at the prospect of being placed in main stream gaol, and this would clearly affect his pre-existing poor emotional state and increased suicide potential"". 
     
      
    21 There was a presentence report before the sentencing judge the contents of which are set out in detail in the psychological report. In relation to the offending the report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender has stated that he formed a friendship with the victim based on them having similar family backgrounds. He further stated that he felt sorry for her as she seemed to be so unhappy. He also stated that he was separated from his wife, although still residing with her at the time. He maintains he was feeling ""lonely and sad"" and had hoped that he could form a romantic relationship with the victim when she was older. 
         
         
        The offender was unable to say why he committed the offences other than he never thought of the victim as being 12 years old. The offender did not expressed any empathy for the victim or her family and in fact expressed his anger at what has occurred to his family as a result of the commission of the offences………. 
         
         
        [The applicant] presents as an emotionally immature man who lacks insight into his offending behaviour and his inappropriate language with children. It would appear that [the applicant] minimises the commission of the offence by stating that he never thought of the victim as being as young as she was. He presents to this Service as being in denial and unable to comprehend the seriousness of his situation and that of the victim. [The applicant's] history of intimate relationships suggest that he has failed to emotionally mature to the point where he can maintain a relationship with an adult partner. 
        
       
      
    22 A witness who had known the applicant for nine to ten years gave evidence. He described the applicant as ""a very kind sincere, honest and a very generous man"". He said that the applicant was very obliging and always ""willing to go out on a limb to help people"". The witness indicated that the applicant's personality had changed after the allegations were made by the complainant and was thereafter very withdrawn and ""very hard to incorporate in family… functions"". Another witness described the applicant as a “good person” who was always very helpful to her children. 
     
      
    23 The Judge gave lengthy sentencing remarks referring in detail to the evidence before him and the principles that he was to apply. He described the offences as ""extremely serious"". He stressed the significance of the degree to which an offender is seen to have exploited the youth of the victim in crimes of this nature. He found the level of exploitation to be assessed by a number of matters, the most important of which were, firstly, the age of the child and, secondly, the age disparity between the child and the offender. In relation to this matter, the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Included in the material tendered by the Crown on sentence without objection is a diary entry of the victim and a letter from the offender to the victim to which I have already referred. That material discloses, first, that the victim at one time clearly was infatuated with the offender and, secondly, that the offender was well aware of the victim's strong feelings towards him. In his letter to the victim he professed to share the same strong feelings towards her. The offender well knew that he could sexually exploit the victim because of her tender age and because of her strong emotional feelings she held for him. In my view, the very young age of the victim in this case and the great discrepancy in age means that there was a high degree of exploitation of the victim by the offender. It is for this reason that I consider the objective seriousness of the offence to be very great indeed. 
        
       
      
    24 In relation to the facts, the Judge held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my view a fair reading of the Agreed Facts at least discloses that Count 3 occurred on a different day to the day or days Counts 1 and 2 were committed. Certainly there is nothing to indicate that Count 1 was other than an opportunistic offence. However, that offence having been committed I do not accept that the commission of Counts 2 and 3 can properly be described as opportunistic and spontaneous. It appears from the facts that the offender inveigled the victim to come into his company and it was he that initiated the sexual activity which took place on those occasions state and, in my view, with respect to those counts there was some degree of planning and the commission of those offences although that planning may not have been over a lengthy period. 
        
       
      
    25 There is one ground of appeal filed which asserts that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. However the written submissions on behalf of the applicant contains an outline of argument which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentences are manifestly excessive on an objective comparison with the notional range applicable to such an offence and having particular regard to: 
         
        The accumulation of sentences. 
         
        Delay. 
         
        A proper appreciation of the applicant's background and its bearing on his offending. 
         
        A finding of hardship in custody arising from assault upon the applicant during the prior period of custody. This finding is not adequately reflected in the sentencing outcomes. 
         
        The above matters are not exhaustive of the reasons, which the applicant submits underlie a reasonably available conclusion that the sentences exceed what was required at law. 
         
        
       
      As no patent error is asserted, it is strictly unnecessary to try to find reasons why a sentence might be manifestly excessive. The question is really one of whether the sentence imposed appears to be unreasonable or unjust when regard is had to the objective facts, the subjective matters favouring the applicant and the relevant sentencing principles. 
       
      
    26 The applicant argues that the sentences imposed are at the "" upper higher level"" of punishment imposed for offences against the section when regard is had to the available statistics and an examination of comparable cases dealt with by this Court. In particular it is argued that there was inconsistency in the Judges remarks in relation to the relevance of the age of the child which led to his Honour wrongly determining the seriousness of this particular offending. The inconsistency is said to arise from the fact that the Judge took into account the ""very young age of the victim"" in relation to determining the clear degree of exploitation of the complainant by the applicant and yet held that the victim's age should not be taken into account as a factor of aggravation because the age is an element of the offence. 
     
      
    27 With respect this argument misconstrues what the Judge said about the age of the complainant when considering what aggravating or mitigating factors might be present under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. What the Judge said in that regard is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my view the victim was clearly vulnerable by reason of her age, namely that she was a child of 12 years of age. However, I have come to the view that I cannot take into account as an aggravating factor that the victim was vulnerable because of the concluding words of s 21A sub-s (2), namely, that a factor is not to be taken into account as an aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence. It is clear that offence under s 66C sub-sec (1) is directed towards the protection of children who are, by the very fact of their age, vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The purpose of the section is to protect the vulnerable, in this case a child……………… However, although I may not take it into account, that is the vulnerability of the victim, as an aggravating factor of the offence, it is still relevant, in my view, to consider the age of the victim in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and as I have already stated, I regard that objective seriousness to be high. 
         
         
        
       
      
    28 In my opinion, with respect, that passage does not disclose any error unfavourable to the applicant. The age of the child is clearly a relevant consideration and the younger the child, the more serious the offence. It was an element of each of the offences in the present case that the child was between the ages of 10 and 16 at the time of the sexual intercourse, but that does not mean that a judge cannot take into account the age of the child falling within that range. 
     
      
    29 Further, although the section is, as the Judge recognised, concerned to protect the vulnerable, it does not follow that a judge cannot take into account the particular vulnerability of the child by reason of the child's young age or other circumstances other than the child's age. For example, in the present case the judge would have been entitled to find that the complainant was particularly vulnerable by reason of her age, the fact that her father was seriously ill such that she felt she could not complain to her parents, and because the applicant knew that she was susceptible to his sexual advances because of her infatuation with him. By not taking into account the aggravating factor that the child was specially vulnerable the Judge erred in the applicant’s favour. 
     
      
    30 However, In my view the judge was right to find that the objective circumstances of the present offence were at a serious level and notwithstanding that the offences could be regarded as isolated occurrences within a relatively short period of time and not being part of a continual abuse of the complainant by the applicant. 
     
      
    31 The delay between the offences and the initiation of proceedings against the applicant does not seem to me to be a matter of any great significance. There is often delay between offences and charges in child sexual assault offences. It is clear that the letter found by the mother would have been insufficient to found charges against the applicant particularly having regard to what he said about it. Then the complainant's mother questioned her about the letter and a diary entry indicating sexual misconduct by the applicant, however the complainant denied that the applicant had done anything more serious than to hug and kiss her. Although the authorities might have spoken to the complainant to investigate whether any misconduct had occurred, the Judge knew nothing about the circumstances surrounding the decision by the police or the Department not to make further inquiries. In any event there is little mitigation by reason of delay where an offender has remained silent in the face of an accusation: R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368; R v Barker and Gibson [2006] NSWCCA 20. 
     
      
    32 However, Mr Craigie SC, who appears for the appellant, stressed that the delay went to the utility of the plea because it would have affected the complainant’s credibility. However, there was no submission that the 15 percent discount chosen by the Judge was inadequate. In any event the judge took into account as ""in mitigation of the sentence"" what he saw as the significant delay between the time the applicant was confronted by the complainant's mother and the date of charging. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The delay in sentencing the offender in relation to all of the matters sought to be pursued by the Crown was outside the offender's control. The fact of these delays and the resultant uncertainty that the offender would undoubtedly have felt as to the final outcome of the prosecution against him, must, in my view be taken into account to some extent by way of mitigation of the sentences to be imposed. 
        
       
      
    33 There is no submission that it was not open to the judge to accumulate the sentences, rather the argument is that by the partial accumulation of the sentences the judge misapplied the principle of totality so that the overall sentence is too harsh for the criminality involved having regard to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. These included the fact that the applicant would serve his sentence in more onerous conditions than other prisoners because the applicant had a particular fear of imprisonment as a result of his being abused when in custody on a previous occasion. It was submitted that the Judge did not step back and consider the overall sentence he was about to impose otherwise he would have concluded that it was out of proportion to the criminality involved. 
     
      
    34 Reliance is also placed upon the applicant's background and the resultant emotional immaturity as being the cause of the offences rather than a ""pathological tendency"" which, it is suggested, is more commonly reflected in offences involving young children. It was pointed out that there was no hint of a tendency on the part of the applicant to prey upon young children. In this regard it is submitted that the Judge placed too much weight on the reference in the psychological and presentence reports to the applicant's lack of insight and his minimisation of his offending. What the judge said about that matter was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        First, I accept that his pleas of guilty demonstrate remorse and contrition on his part although it appears, particularly from the presentence report and the psychological report of Ms Collins, that the offender still does not have complete insight into his offending behaviour he still seeking to minimise the effects of his offending behaviour on the victim. But I do accept, in particular by his pleas of guilty, his expressions of remorse and contrition as now being genuine. 
        
       
      
    35 There is nothing in that passage or elsewhere in the sentencing remarks to indicate that the Judge was placing undue weight on that matter. But rather it seems to me that the Judge was simply noting that, notwithstanding the lack of insight and his tendency to minimise effects of the offending, he was prepared to find that the applicant was truly contrite. There is nothing in what the Judge said that in my view suggests that the lack of insight was being reflected in some form of concern about further offending or dangerousness on the part of the applicant that leave his Honour to impose sentences that were out of proportion to the criminality of the applicant having regard to his subjective features. 
     
      
    36 The applicant relied upon a number of decisions of this Court “not as precedents but as some assistance in assessing where various features would properly place the present matter in an appropriate range"". The decisions referred to, the schedule relied upon by the applicant and the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission indicate that there is a wide variation in the sentences that are imposed for offences of this type. That no doubt reflects the range of activity included within the concept of sexual intercourse and in the varying circumstances surrounding the offending. They are of little assistance in my view except as indicating the sentence imposed by the judge is at the upper end of the range. 
     
      
    37 I agree with the sentencing judge that the objective facts in this matter were particularly serious and notwithstanding the material contained in the psychological report in relation to the effect on the applicant of the abuse he suffered in gaol. I appreciate that particularly with the complainant there is little difference in the criminality of a sexual assault and by reason of the nature of that assault. However with young children it seems to me that penile penetration is the most serious form of sexual assault for the obvious reason that it is the most likely to result in physical injury to the child. In the present case the applicant initiated the sexual activity, he knew that the child was vulnerable to his advances and, despite the complainant's unwillingness to indulge in sexual intercourse either by way of fellatio or penetration of her vagina, the applicant subjected her to that course of conduct. He was well aware of the complainant's age and it was simply no excuse to suggest, as he did, that he did not think of her as a child of those tender years. 
     
      
    38 Although the overall sentence was a high one, it was in my view within the Judge's discretion to impose that sentence. It should be noted that the discount given for the pleas of guilty was 15 percent in this case because of the lateness of the pleas. When consideration is given to the statistics, a court must take into account that generally sentences following guilty pleas would have been discounted by 25 is one having regard to the fact that pleas of guilty have particular value in this type of offence as it saves the complainant from giving evidence. 
     
      
    39 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Andrew Howard John Pike (“the appellant” or “Mr Pike”) appealed against his convictions, after a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge McLoughlin and a jury, on seven charges of dishonestly obtaining money by deception. In the event of his appeal against conviction being dismissed, the appellant sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge McLoughlin. Mr Pike was not legally represented and appeared for himself, both at the trial and on this appeal. 
     
      
    3 On 6 December 2004, being the date on which the trial commenced, Mr Pike made an application for an adjournment of the trial. This application was refused by Judge McLoughlin. Mr Pike was then arraigned on an indictment containing fourteen counts, to each of which he pleaded not guilty. Having regard to the grounds of appeal against conviction relied on by Mr Pike and the grounds on which I consider that the appeal against conviction should be determined, it is appropriate to set out in full the terms of the counts in the indictment against Mr Pike:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. For that he on or about 9 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he was a solicitor and that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $10,000 from Stuart Birk. 
        
       
        
       
        
        2. Further that on or about 9 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he was a solicitor and that he would invest moneys advanced to him including short term local loans secured by goods, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $150 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        3. Further that on 11 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he could arrange for the reduction of his PAYE tax, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely in the amount of $600 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        4. Further that on 12 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him including loans to local people who would put up personal possessions for security, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $1000 from Stuart Birk. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Further that on 12 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him including loans to local people who would put up personal possessions for security, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $900 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        6. Further that on 19 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he was a solicitor and that a client of his needed $800 for bail and that a profit of $200 would be made in fourteen days, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $800 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        7. Further that on 23 November 1999 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $5000 from Stuart Birk. 
         
        
       
       
        
        8. Further that on or about 1 February 2000 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $1000 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        9. Further that on or about 27 April 2000 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $1000 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        10. Further, that on 4 May 2000 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would acquire shares in an internet company for him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $387 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        11. Further that on 5 May 2000 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Stuart Birk that he would set up and register a trustee company for him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $720 from Stuart Birk. 
         
          
         
        12. Further that between 28 January 2000 and 16 March 2000 at Daleys Point in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Lorna Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $10,000 from Lorna Birk. 
         
          
         
        13. Further between 28 January 2000 and 16 March 2000 at Daleys Point in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Lorna Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $30,000 from Lorna Birk. 
         
          
         
        14. Further between 1 March 2000 and 30 April 2000 at Daleys Point in the State of New South Wales by deception, namely by falsely representing to Lorna Birk that he would invest moneys advanced to him, dishonestly obtained for himself money namely an amount of $9200 from Lorna Birk”. 
         
          
        
       
      
    4 There were, accordingly, two alleged victims of the offences charged, Mr Stuart Birk (counts 1-11) and Mrs Lorna Birk (counts 12-14). Mrs Lorna Birk is Mr Stuart Birk’s mother. 
     
      
    5 During the trial the jury, at the direction of the trial judge, returned verdicts of not guilty on each of counts 2, 4, 5 and 6. At the conclusion of the trial the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each of counts 1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 and verdicts of not guilty on each of counts 3, 10 and 11. 
     
      
    6 Judge McLoughlin imposed the following sentences for the offences of which Mr Pike had been found guilty:- 
     
      
       
      The offence charged in count 1 – imprisonment for fourteen months, with a non-parole period of seven months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 May 2005. 
       
       
      Offences charged in counts 7 and 8 – for each offence imprisonment for twelve months, with a non-parole period of six months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 August 2005. 
       
       
      Offence charged in count 9 – imprisonment for twelve months, with a non-parole period of six months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 September 2005. 
       
       
      Offence charged in count 12 – imprisonment for thirteen months, with a non-parole period of seven months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 September 2005. 
       
       
      Offence charged in count 13 – imprisonment for fourteen months, with a non-parole period of seven months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 October 2005. 
       
       
      Offence charged in count 14 – imprisonment for thirteen months, with a non-parole period of six months, to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on 20 November 2005. 
       
      
    7 All of the offences had been committed before 1 February 2003 and, accordingly, the appellant was sentenced in accordance with the previous, and not the current, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    8 The total effect of the sentences was that the appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling nineteen months, with non-parole periods totalling twelve months, the sentences to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    9 The principal witnesses in the Crown case at the trial were Mr Birk and Mrs Birk. Mrs Birk in fact gave evidence before Mr Birk but I will first refer to Mr Birk’s evidence. 
     
      
    10 Mr Birk gave evidence that he first met the appellant in late 1999. The appellant told Mr Birk his name, that he was a barrister and that he was practicing from home because he had the custody of his two children. Mr Birk had “no reason not to” believe the appellant. The appellant told Mr Birk that he could invest money for Mr Birk and obtain a better rate of interest than Mr Birk was obtaining in an investment at a credit union. 
     
      
    11 Mr Birk made enquiries of the New South Wales Bar Association and found out that there was no one named Andrew Pike registered as a barrister but that there was an Andrew Pike registered with the Law Society as a solicitor. 
     
      
    12 When Mr Birk spoke to Mr Pike again, Mr Pike said that he was the Andrew Pike registered with the Law Society as a solicitor. In the presence of Mr Birk Mr Pike brought up on a computer screen a list of names of members of the Law Society and, when the name “Andrew Pike” appeared, the appellant said “there, this is me”. Alongside the name “Andrew Pike” on the screen was the name of the law firm Freehill Hollingdale and Page. After he had looked at the screen, Mr Birk said “Okay”. The appellant said that he was working from his home in a country town, because his children were attending a school in that area. 
     
      
    13 The appellant told Mr Birk that he could invest $10,000 for Mr Birk and obtain an interest rate of $35 per $1,000 per month for a period of ninety days. 
     
      
    14 After having been told by the appellant that he was a solicitor with Freehill Hollingdale and Page, Mr Birk telephoned the Law Society and then Freehill Hollingdale and Page. The receptionist at Freehill Hollingdale and Page confirmed that there was a solicitor named Andrew Pike working for Freehill Hollingdale and Page. Mr Birk declined an offer by the receptionist to be put through to the solicitor Andrew Pike who was working for Freehill Hollingdale and Page.  
     
      
    15 Mr Birk decided to provide the appellant with $10,000 to be invested for him. He said in evidence “I agreed to invest that sum of money with Andrew Pike, in the belief that he was a solicitor and he was going to invest the money for me”. 
     
      
    16 On 9 November 1999 Mr Birk signed a cheque for $10,000 drawn on his account at a credit union in favour of “Andrew Pike”. The appellant said to Mr Birk that “it would be better to cash this cheque today, so that we could lock in the interest rate today”. 
     
      
    17 The appellant and Mr Birk went to the premises of the credit union and cashed the cheque. They spoke to a female employee of the credit union, who was clearly a Ms Donna Reedy. 
     
      
    18 Because the amount of the cheque was $10,000, a significant cash transaction report had to be completed. On this return particulars of Mr Birk as the person conducting the transaction were entered. Under printed words on the form reading “Person 2 (if more than one customer at counter)” the name “Andrew Pike” was written, with the appellant’s address, and alongside the word “occupation” the word “solicitor” was written. Mr Birk said in evidence “I had introduced him (to Ms Reedy) as my solicitor. I cannot recall whether he stated he was a solicitor”.  
     
      
    19 After the cheque was cashed at the credit union, Mr Birk handed the $10,000 in cash to the appellant. This payment of $10,000 by Mr Birk to the appellant gave rise to count 1 in the indictment. 
     
      
    20 The appellant told Mr Birk that he could invest money in short term loans to local people on securities over goods at an interest rate of 20 per cent. Mr Birk provided $150 to the appellant for investment (count 2). Two weeks later the principal sum was repaid, together with interest at 20 per cent.  
     
      
    21 On 11 November 1999 Mr Birk had a further conversation with the appellant. The appellant said that he had “associates” who could arrange for a certificate to be provided to Mr Birk, which would result in a reduction in Mr Birk’s PAYE income tax. Mr Birk provided the appellant with a cheque for $600 as the cost of “having that done” (count 4). Mr Birk never subsequently received any document from anyone which would reduce his PAYE income tax. 
     
      
    22 On 12 November 1999 the appellant told Mr Birk that he could place the sum of $1900 on short term loans to local clients with securities over goods at an interest rate of 20 per cent. On 12 November 1999 Mr Birk provided the appellant with two cheques, one for $1,000 and one for $900 (counts 4 and 5). 
     
      
    23 In his evidence Mr Birk first said that he had been repaid the sum of $1900 with interest. However, a little later in his evidence he said that he would have to correct the evidence he had just given. He said that he had not received payment of either principal or interest. When Mr Birk asked to be paid, the appellant said that he had combined the principal sum of $1900 and the interest with other monies in a new “instrument of trust”, which he showed to Mr Birk. 
     
      
    24 On or about 19 November 2000 the appellant told Mr Birk that he had a client at Parramatta who had to raise $800 for bail and that the client would require the money for two weeks and that, if Mr Birk lent the money, he would receive interest at the rate of 20 per cent. Mr Birk provided $800 in cash to the appellant (count 6). The principal sum of $800 was repaid to Mr Birk together with interest. 
     
      
    25 On or about 21 November 1999 Mr Birk provided the appellant with a cheque for $5,000, the proceeds to be invested at interest by the appellant for Mr Birk (count 7). Mr Birk received two payments of interest in December 1999 and in January 2000 respectively but the principal sum of $5,000 was never repaid. 
     
      
    26 In December 1999 Mr Birk had a conversation with his mother Mrs Lorna Birk, in which he told his mother that he had invested money with the appellant and his mother suggested that she also might invest monies with the appellant. Mr Birk asked the appellant whether his mother could invest monies with the appellant and the appellant replied that that would be possible. Mr Birk received from his mother a cheque for $10,000 in favour of the appellant and handed the cheque to the appellant (count 12). At the time the cheque was handed over the appellant said that he would visit Mrs Birk and discuss the investment of her money with her. 
     
      
    27 In January 2000 Mr Birk received from the appellant a document described as an “instrument of trust”. The appellant said that some of the investments had performed better than the appellant had expected and the appellant had combined the principal sums of $10,000 and $5,000 into one consolidated fund. 
     
      
    28 In February 2000 Mr Birk provided $1,000 in cash to the appellant for investment by him (count 8). 
     
      
    29 In April 2000 Mr Birk provided a further sum of $1,000 in cash to the appellant for investment by him (count 9). 
     
      
    30 It can be inferred from Mr Birk’s evidence that the appellant did not repay either sum of $1,000. 
     
      
    31 In April and May 2000 the appellant told Mr Birk that the appellant had been engaged by an internet company to assist in the world wide launch of the company and that the appellant had been able to acquire a large number of shares in the company by allocation, prior to any offer of shares being made to the public. The appellant discussed with Mr Birk the acquisition of shares in the company and Mr Birk handed a cheque for $387 to the appellant (count 10). Mr Birk never received any shares in the company. 
     
      
    32 On 5 May 2000 the appellant and Mr Birk had a conversation in which Mr Birk said that he would like to set up a company to hold assets in trust for himself and his children and the appellant said that he could arrange for such a company to be registered but that it would cost $720. Mr Birk paid the appellant $720 (count 11). 
     
      
    33 In May 2000 Mr Birk became concerned about what was happening to his and his mother’s money. On 17 May 2000 Mr Birk delivered to the appellant letters from himself and his mother. In his letter Mr Birk said that he had a previously unanticipated need for funds for one of his children and he asked for the immediate return of all of the monies held by the appellant on behalf of Mr Birk. The appellant said that under the terms of the trust on which the monies were held, Mr Birk had to give a certain period of notice in order to withdraw funds and that, if funds were withdrawn on less notice, there would be certain costs and interest would be foregone. Mr Birk said “that is acceptable but we want our money. He (the appellant) indicated that he would attempt to get our money for us and return it to us”.  
     
      
    34 Mr Birk consulted a solicitor Mr Smith. Court proceedings were brought on behalf of Mr Birk and Mrs Birk. After the court proceedings were concluded, a sum of $3,000, but no further sum, was paid by the appellant to Mr Smith on behalf of his clients. 
     
      
    35 Mr Birk was cross-examined at considerable length by the appellant. 
     
      
    36 In cross-examination Mr Birk said that the appellant had told him that he had not maintained his registration as a barrister because the annual fees were too high but he had maintained his registration as a solicitor and could re-register himself as a barrister, if the need arose. 
     
      
    37 It was put to Mr Birk that on 9 November 1999 he had met a Mr Keith Sheehan at the appellant’s home but Mr Birk had no recollection of any such meeting. 
     
      
    38 During the cross-examination of Mr Birk the Crown prosecutor informed the court that he would not oppose the trial judge directing verdicts of not guilty on counts 2 and 6, because it was part of the Crown case that the monies provided by Mr Birk to the appellant had not been repaid and “in count 2 and count 6 it was repaid and therefore I would not be at the end of the Crown case saying that there should not be a verdict by direction”. 
     
      
    39 It was put to Mr Birk, and he denied, that on 8 November 1999, before providing any money to the appellant, he had conversations “by voice transmission in real time both pictures and sound” with unidentified persons in the United Kingdom and Canada about how monies provided for investment might be utilised. 
     
      
    40 During the cross-examination Mr Birk said, with reference to the sum of $5,000 provided in November 1999 that the appellant had said that he was going to invest it with Freehill Hollingdale and Page. Mr Birk had not given this evidence in his evidence in chief. 
     
      
    41 The following questions and answers occurred in cross-examination:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Q. On 9 November 1999 I put to you Mr Birk that you had no knowledge and no belief that I was a solicitor? 
         
        A. I did because you told me so”. 
        
       
       
       ….. 
       
       
        
        “Q. On 9 November 1999 I put to you that you freely and willingly invested the sum of $10,000 not because (you believed) that I was a solicitor? 
         
        A. I only placed the money with you because I did believe you were a solicitor”. 
        
       
      
    42 Mr Birk denied in cross-examination that he had not told his mother that the appellant was a barrister or solicitor until May 2000 and denied that he had merely told his mother that the appellant was an “investment adviser”. 
     
      
    43 Mrs Lorna Birk at the time of giving evidence at the trial was eighty-one years old. In the year 2000 she had been living in a retirement village.  
     
      
    44 As a result of a conversation with her son Mr Stuart Birk she had decided to invest money with the appellant. She gave her son a cheque for $10,000 in favour of the appellant to pass on to the appellant (count 12). At this stage she had never met or spoken to the appellant. All she understood was that the money would be “invested” by the appellant. 
     
      
    45 Mrs Birk telephoned the appellant in January 2000 and complained that she had not received a receipt for her $10,000. The appellant said that he had sent a receipt but Mrs Birk never received a receipt for the $10,000. 
     
      
    46 In late February 2000 Mrs Birk posted to the appellant a cheque for $30,000 in favour of the appellant for investment by him (count 13). She had still not met the appellant.  
     
      
    47 About ten days later Mrs Birk telephoned the appellant and complained that she had not received any receipt for the $30,000. The appellant said that he would visit Mrs Birk and explain how her $40,000 had been invested. 
     
      
    48 On 13 March 2000 the appellant visited Mrs Birk at the retirement village. The appellant produced a number of documents which became parts of exhibit O at the trial, including a document headed “Investment Dispersal of $40,000”, a receipt for $40,000, a document setting out achieved and anticipated rates of interest and a document entitled “Deed of Investment”. There was little discussion of the documents between the appellant and Mrs Birk. The appellant handed to Mrs Birk a cheque for a first payment of interest of $186.00. 
     
      
    49 At some time after the meeting on 13 March 2000 Mrs Birk sent the appellant a further cheque for $9,200 (count 14). 
     
      
    50 As a result of a conversation with her son Mrs Birk decided to terminate her investments with the appellant. On 16 May 2000 she prepared a letter to the appellant in which she requested termination of her investments immediately. She gave the letter to her son to deliver to the appellant. Subsequently Mrs Birk and her son consulted the solicitor Mr Smith. 
     
      
    51 At the conclusion of Mrs Birk’s examination in chief the appellant made an application for directed verdicts of not guilty on counts 12, 13 and 14. However, the trial judge said that such an application was premature, because the Crown had not yet closed it case. As I have already noted, Mrs Birk in fact gave her evidence before Mr Birk gave evidence. 
     
      
    52 In cross-examination by the appellant Mrs Birk said that “early on in the piece,” before she invested, her son had told her that the appellant was a solicitor and she said that in making the investments she had relied on the information supplied by her son. 
     
      
    53 The Crown called some other witnesses, who gave fairly brief evidence. I will refer to some only of this evidence.  
     
      
    54 Mr Andrew Pike solicitor of Freehill Hollingdale and Page gave evidence, thereby demonstrating, obviously, that the appellant was not the Andrew Pike solicitor of Freehill Hollingdale and Page.  
     
      
    55 Mr Smith solicitor gave evidence that in May 2000 he had received instructions from Mr Birk and Mrs Birk to commence court proceedings against the appellant. As an immediate injunction was being sought, the proceedings were commenced in the Equity Division of this Court. On 5 June 2000 the court proceedings were settled, the appellant consenting to a judgment in favour of Mr Birk in the sum of $25,700 and a judgment in favour of Mrs Birk in the sum of $50,000. It was agreed that there should be a stay of execution on the judgments, provided that the amounts of the judgment debts were paid by certain instalments. The first instalment of $3,000 was paid but no further instalments were paid. 
     
      
    56 Ms Donna Reedy gave evidence that in November 1999 she had been an employee of the credit union of which Mr Birk was a member. She accepted that, after the lapse of several years, she had no actual recollection of what had happened at the credit union on 9 November 1999. However, she identified most of the handwriting on the significant cash transaction report referring to Mr Birk and Andrew Pike as being her handwriting. She confirmed that a cheque for $10,000 drawn on Mr Birk’s account at the credit union had been presented and cashed. 
     
      
    57 In her evidence in chief Ms Reedy said that the information on the report about “Andrew Pike,” including the information that he was a “solicitor,” would have been supplied by Mr Pike. In cross-examination she conceded that, not having any actual recollection of the transaction, it was possible that it was Mr Birk who had supplied the information that the appellant was a solicitor. 
     
      
       
      Directed Verdicts 
       
      
    58 At the conclusion of the Crown case the appellant applied for directed verdicts of not guilty on counts 12, 13 and 14. This application was refused by the trial judge. It will be necessary to return to what was said on this application, when considering some of the grounds of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    59 The Crown prosecutor at the trial accepted that the concession he had earlier made that verdicts of not guilty should be directed on counts 2 and 6 should extend to counts 4 and 5. In directing the jury to return verdicts of not guilty on counts 2, 4, 5 and 6 the trial judge said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As a matter of law I have concluded that the evidence given in those matters could not establish an essential ingredient of the offence. You will remember that Mr Birk gave evidence in relation to the payment back to him of monies and that they relate to four of the offences”. 
        
       
      
    60 In accordance with the direction it had been given, the jury proceeded to return verdicts of not guilty on counts 2, 4, 5 and 6. 
     
      
       
      The Defence Case 
       
      
    61 The defendant did not give evidence in his own case. The only witness called by the appellant was Mr Keith Sheehan, who was asked principally about an alleged meeting with the appellant in November 1999 at the appellant’s home at which some other person, who Mr Sheehan could not identify, was present. It would not appear to me that Mr Sheehan’s evidence significantly assisted the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The Addresses 
       
      
    62 The Crown prosecutor, in deference to the appellant being unrepresented, made only a brief closing address. In this address the Crown prosecutor said that “no money has ever come forward, not one single dollar and the Crown’s argument is a very simple one that… there has never been a dollar repaid to these people. So the Crown’s argument is simply the only conclusion you draw is, he never invested”. 
     
      
    63 In his closing address the appellant submitted inter alia that the Crown had to prove that the appellant had not invested the monies provided and that the Crown had not proved that the appellant had not invested the monies provided. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    64 The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal (as stated in a document sent by the appellant to the Registry of this Court):- 
     
      
       
        
        ” 
        1. The verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 7, 8, 9 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        2. The verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 7, 8, 9 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of not guilty on counts 2 and 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11. 
         
         
        3. The verdicts of guilty on count 12 is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        4. The verdicts of guilty on counts 13 and 14 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        5. That the trial judge has failed to take into account and he ought to have considered in regards to the applicant’s application to adjourn the trial for 5 weeks and denying the applicant’s right to produce witnesses to defend the charges for the conduct of a fair trial. 
         
         
        6. The trial judge made error in not correcting the crown in the Crown’s closing argument that led to the jury being misled. 
         
         
        7. The sentencing judge failed to have regard extraneous bail obligations, imposed upon the applicant. 
         
         
        8. The sentencing judge made error in imposing cumulative sentences”. 
        
       
      
    65 It is apparent that the first six grounds of appeal are grounds of appeal against conviction and that the remaining two grounds are grounds of appeal against sentence. As to the grounds of appeal against conviction, it is convenient to deal first with the more specific grounds, grounds 5 and 6, before dealing with the more general grounds, grounds 1-4. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 5 
       
      
    66 As I have already stated, the appellant on 6 December 2004 applied for the trial to be adjourned. The application was for an adjournment of five weeks, on the grounds that the appellant wished to call overseas witnesses from the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom and that he had exhausted his funds. The Crown prosecutor, in opposing the application, handed up a chronology of the criminal proceedings against the appellant. The trial judge, without giving a separate judgement, dismissed the application for an adjournment.  
     
      
    67 The document containing a chronology which the Crown prosecutor handed up to the trial judge was not precisely identified on the hearing of this appeal but I consider that it can properly be inferred (partly from the terms of the recorded argument on 6 December 2004) that it contained the same entries, or many of the same entries, as were contained in a chronology supplied to this Court. 
     
      
    68 According to the chronology supplied to this Court, the appellant had been committed for trial as long ago as 1 July 2002. At many mentions the appellant had asserted that he intended to call overseas witnesses, for example at the mentions held on 24 September 2002, 4 March 2003, 10 June 2003, 9 September 2003, 4 November 2003, 23 December 2003 and 20 September 2004. On 9 September 2003 the appellant had told the court that he had eleven witnesses, including six witnesses from overseas. 
     
      
    69 A number of previous trial dates had been fixed. A trial date on 23 March 2004 was vacated on the application of the Crown, because Mrs Birk was unavailable to give evidence. A trial date on 1 June 2004 was vacated on the application of the Crown, which was not opposed by the appellant, on the grounds that the Crown wished to investigate new evidence. On 1 June 2004 a trial date on 10 September 2004 was fixed. 
     
      
    70 The appellant applied to vacate the trial date on 10 September 2004, on the grounds that he was unrepresented and had several overseas witnesses. The appellant’s application was refused but the trial did not in fact proceed on 10 September 2004.  
     
      
    71 On 24 September 2004 the appellant successfully applied for an adjournment to enable a Canadian witness he proposed to call to obtain a passport and to enable the appellant to seek to re-engage counsel. On 24 September 2004 a trial date of 6 December 2004 was fixed. At a mention on 26 November 2004 the trial date of 6 December 2004 was confirmed. 
     
      
    72 Having regard to the long history of the matter, the ample opportunities the appellant had had to secure the attendance of any overseas witnesses he wished to call, the appellant’s applications in September 2004 to vacate the trial date and to adjourn the proceedings and the confirmation on 26 November 2004 of the trial date of 6 December 2004, I do not consider that it has been established that the trial judge erred in his discretionary decision to refuse the appellant’s application for an adjournment and I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 6 
       
      
    73 As I have already indicated earlier in this judgment, the Crown prosecutor in his brief closing address told the jury that, after the demands for repayment had been made in May 2000 and after the equity proceedings had been settled, “no money has ever come forward, not one single dollar”.  
     
      
    74 What the Crown prosecutor said was erroneous, because after the equity proceedings had been settled and in accordance with the terms of settlement of those proceedings, a sum of $3,000 had been paid.  
     
      
    75 However, this error was corrected by the trial judge saying in his summing-up that $3,000 had been paid back and I do not consider that the jury in its deliberations would have been under any misapprehension. 
     
      
    76 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 1, 2, 3 and 4 
       
      
    77 These grounds of appeal can conveniently be dealt with together.  
     
      
    78 In his written submissions in support of these grounds the appellant attacked the credibility of Mr Birk. However, Mr Birk’s oral evidence was confirmed in many respects by contemporaneous documents and it would clearly have been open to the jury to accept the main parts of Mr Birk’s evidence, as summarised by me earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    79 In his oral submissions at the hearing of the appeal the appellant attacked the credibility of Ms Reedy. As I have stated earlier, Ms Reedy, candidly and unsurprisingly, conceded that she had no actual recollection of any transaction which had occurred on 9 November 1999. However, she could identify her own handwriting on the significant cash transaction report. Furthermore, even if the information appearing on the report that the appellant was a solicitor had not been supplied directly by the appellant, it would have been supplied by Mr Birk in the appellant’s presence and without any demur by the appellant. In any event, Ms Reedy’s evidence was only of marginal significance. 
     
      
    80 Quite apart from the submissions made by the appellant to which I have referred, I consider that there are much more fundamental problems with most of the verdicts of guilty on those counts on which verdicts of guilty were returned. It is convenient to temporarily put to one side the verdict of guilty on count 1, which raises special considerations. 
     
      
    81 All of counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 were charges of offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act. Section 178BA of the Crimes Act, so far as is relevant, provides:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “178BA Obtaining money etc by deception 
         
         
        (1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        (2) In subsection (1): 
         
        deception means deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including: 
         
          
          (a) a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or of any other person...” 
          
         
        
       
      
    82 In subs (2) of s 178BA “deception” is defined as meaning deception as to fact or as to law. In the present case it is clear that there was no deception as to law and that the Crown relied on deceptions as to fact.  
     
      
    83 As is confirmed by the terms of paragraph (a) of subs (2), the making of a promise would not, of itself, be a deception as to a matter of fact, although, if the person making the promise did not, at the time of making the promise, intend to perform the promise, there could be a deception as to the present intentions of the person making the promise and therefore a deception within the definition. 
     
      
    84 In all of counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 the deception alleged was a false representation to Mr Birk or to Mrs Birk that the appellant would invest monies advanced to him. In my opinion, the deception alleged in all of these counts should be characterised as a promise and as therefore being incapable of itself of amounting to a false representation as to a matter of fact within the definition in s 178BA(2). 
     
      
    85 It would have been open to the Crown to allege, in each count, as being a deception as to a matter of fact, that the appellant, at the time of making the promise, had no intention of performing his promise that the money would be invested. However, this was not the way in which the deception was framed in the indictment or the way in which the Crown presented its case or the way in which the trial judge instructed the jury. 
     
      
    86 It was submitted by the Crown that there was no significant difference between a representation by the appellant that he would invest money and a representation by the appellant that at the time of obtaining the money he had the present intention of investing the money. However, the element of deception is at the core of an alleged offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act and it is important in a trial for an alleged offence under s 178BA that the deception alleged by the Crown should be precisely specified and, as specified, should fall within the definition of deception in the section. 
     
      
    87 I will now turn to another aspect of the appeal. 
     
      
    88 As I have indicated earlier in this judgment, the appellant after the conclusion of Mrs Birk’s examination in chief, made an application for directed verdicts of not guilty on counts 12, 13, and 14, but the trial judge refused the application on the ground that it was premature.  
     
      
    89 At the conclusion of the Crown case the appellant renewed his application. The transcript of the argument on the renewed application was quoted in full in the appellant’s written submissions and I will now reproduce it in full:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ACCUSED: I’m making a submission your Honour in regards to counts 12, 13 and 14 which I submit that a direction to the jury should also go on the basis of the submission is your Honour that with the evidence from Lorna Birk, she did not state a purpose for the money was invested. I put to you your Honour that the Crown has not put by way of evidence of where the money was. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, where the money was? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: Well my understanding the first indictment for account number 12. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: There is evidence the money went to you, is there not? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And there is evidence that Ms Birk was relying on the representation that you were a solicitor or barrister, was there not? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I believe that that representation came from her son your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But there is evidence, is there not, of that? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: That she relied on? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What the son told her, you had told him. 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: Yes I agree with that your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What is your submission? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: Well my understanding of the counts is that one is to state of the deception, or the elements is that one is for the deception, the element of deception which is addressed by your Honour that way but the second one comes to the actual purpose of the investment. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, is your submission that, notwithstanding what the representation was that was made, that the monies were given to you to invest. There is no evidence to sustain the charges? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: That’s correct your Honour, by the natural purpose of the funds to invest. The money was invested and as her testimony has said is that she just gave money to invest. She did not know what she was investing in. It was just an investment. Mrs Birk has agreed that she understood that investment means risk but at no time did she actually know what she was actually investing in. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, where is the evidence that the monies were not invested? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well your Honour that’s a circumstantial case that applies to all of the counts your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No but in the earlier matters – in each of these three, 12, 13 and 14, by deception namely by falsely representing to Lorna Birk that he would invest monies advanced to him. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s correct your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But where is the evidence that he didn’t invest them. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The evidence we didn’t invest them is because when they asked for the repayment on 16 May 2000 and then when they took out the equity proceedings no monies were ever repaid. 
        
       
       
        
        His honour: But that’s not to say that they weren’t invested. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes well that’s the conclusion we’ve asked. That’s the only way we can prove it wasn’t invested. 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I would put to your Honour that Mrs Birk there, she admitted that when they took the equity proceedings that they had actually technically breached the agreement they had with me. It was only 14 days on .. (not transcribable). 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s not the point your Honour. The point is the monies were asked to be immediately repaid. This is not contractual, irrespective of whether it’s 30 days or 60 days. Ever since the date of the equity proceedings beforehand, no monies were every returned to her. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But does that mean to say they weren’t invested? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR; Yes it does. That’s the conclusion we ask, that because since 2000, irrespective of the demand and the equity proceedings she never received a dollar. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That maybe so but that doesn’t… 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s why it’s a circumstantial case and it equally applies to all of the counts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well not necessarily in that the relations of the matters with Mr Birk, he says he only paid the money over because of the representation that he’s a solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes but it’s got to be dishonestly obtained for himself and it’s a dual deception in count 1, solicitor and invest monies and what the Crown case is why I opened is a deception from the fact that no monies were ever repaid. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But that doesn’t-- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour if we would have put ‘did invest’, the same as saying fraudulently omitted to account, we could have charged Mr Pike with fraudulently omitting to account and irrespective-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well we’re just dealing with the charges with which he is charged. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well your Honour that’s the conclusion. That’s why it would have to be a circumstantial direction that no monies were ever invested because there was never any repayment. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But why does that lead to a conclusion that the monies weren’t invested? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Because if they were invested then they’d be available. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But somebody may decide not to pay them back. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well that’s right but that’s a conclusion on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Which would be a straight debt matter. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No it would be a fraudulent omission to account. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I mean so far as this matter was concerned-- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: You see that’s why it’s a circumstantial case. Mr Pike has never repaid any. Therefore the Crown case has been that he fraudulently omitted to invest those amount because if they were invested he would have been able to repay them. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But he may have been able to repay them, there’s no evidence either way. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: But that’s why we have to have a circumstantial direction, because if the monies were invested-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But is that the Crown case is that the jury will be asked to infer that because the monies were not repaid when demand was made or at all, that the jury is then able to find that the monies were not invested? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right your Honour, because that applies not only to Mr Stuart Birk but also to his mother. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well the three matters in relation to his mother don’t rely upon representation that the accused was a solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Don’t rely upon them, that’s correct your Honour. It has nothing to do with him becoming a solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So it’s a straight out monies being advanced for investment and you say the only evidence of it not being invested is the finding – and you say the proper inference the jury would draw from that is that he didn’t invest them? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right because both the son and the mother made a letter of demand and then the accused acknowledged that he owed it but that’s why we tendered the equity proceedings, exhibit Q and when he-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes Mr Crown, I’m against you. I think it’s a matter that is a jury question and I’ve got to decide whether or not Mr Pike – but I will direct them that they are to acquit you in relation to charges 2, 4, 5 and 6. 
         
        Anything else Mr Pike?” 
        
       
      
    90 His Honour’s remark early in this argument that there was evidence that Mrs Birk relied on a representation that the appellant was a solicitor or a barrister was not relevant, because no such representation was alleged in any of counts 12, 13 and 14. Nor was any such representation alleged in any of counts 7, 8 and 9. 
     
      
    91 The basis of the application for directed verdicts, as elicited by the trial judge in the course of the argument, was that there was no evidence that the monies had not been invested.  
     
      
    92 It is apparent from a number of remarks made by the trial judge in the course of the argument that the trial judge had considerable difficulty in accepting the Crown submission that it could be inferred, to the criminal standard of proof, from the single circumstance that the money had not been repaid, that it had not been invested. 
     
      
    93 At the conclusion of the argument the transcript records the trial judge as saying “Yes Mr Crown I’m against you”, which would indicate that the trial judge considered that the appellant’s application should succeed, but then immediately afterwards saying that he thought it was a jury question (and, accordingly, the appellant’s application had to be refused). 
     
      
    94 In my opinion, even assuming that a proper question for the jury to determine on each count was whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had not invested the money he had received, as distinct from whether the Crown had proved that at the time of obtaining the money the appellant had not had the intention of investing it, the trial judge’s initial, and indeed long sustained, reluctance to accept the Crown’s submission was well founded. 
     
      
    95 In the Crown prosecutor’s brief closing address and in the summing-up the only circumstance put to the jury as forming a basis for inferring beyond reasonable doubt that the monies the subject of counts 12, 13 and 14 had not been invested was that the monies had not been repaid. 
     
      
    96 In my opinion, it was not open to the jury on any of these counts to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, from the single circumstance that the money had not been repaid, that the money had not been invested. Few, if any, limitations had been placed by Mrs Birk on what would qualify as an investment of her monies. One possible explanation of any failure by the appellant to repay money, which the Crown would have had to negative beyond reasonable doubt, would have been that the money had been invested but that the investment had turned out to be unsuccessful and the money had been lost. 
     
      
    97 It is true that the appellant did not give evidence at the trial but, consistently with authority, this could not be used to ground or strengthen any inference in favour of the Crown (RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620). 
     
      
    98 Although the appellant’s application at the trial for directed verdicts was limited to counts 12, 13 and 14, similar reasoning would apply to counts 7, 8 and 9, in each of which the only representation alleged by the Crown was a promise that the money would be invested and the only circumstance relied on by the Crown to prove that the money had not been invested was that the money had not been repaid. 
     
      
    99 As I have previously indicated, the trial judge, with the consent and indeed on the application of the Crown, withdrew counts 2, 4, 5 and 6 from the jury on the ground that, on each count, the money provided by Mr Birk had been repaid. Of the remaining counts left to the jury the jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14 but returned verdicts of not guilty on counts 3, 10 and 11. The question arises whether the verdicts of guilty can be reconciled with the verdicts of not guilty on counts 3, 10 and 11. 
     
      
    100 Counts 3, 10 and 11 differed from the counts on which verdicts of guilty were returned, in that the representation alleged was, not that the appellant would invest money, but a more particular promise that he could or would obtain some benefit for Mr Birk, namely that he could arrange for Mr Birk’s income tax to be reduced (count 3), or that he would acquire shares in an internet company for Mr Birk (count 10) or that he would set up and register a trustee company for Mr Birk (count 11). However, notwithstanding this difference, the Crown case on counts 3, 10 and 11 was essentially the same as its case on counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14, that is that the appellant had made a promise, which had not been kept. There would not appear to me to be any rational basis on which the jury could have accepted Mr Birk’s evidence on counts 7, 8 and 9, that a promise to invest had been made, which had not been kept, yet not have accepted Mr Birk’s evidence on counts 3, 10 and 11 that the promise alleged in each of those counts had been made and had not been kept and the money paid to the appellant had not been returned. 
     
      
    101 I do not consider that there any proper way to reconcile the verdicts of guilty on counts 7, 8 and 9 and counts 12, 13 and 14 with the verdicts of not guilty on counts 3, 10 and 11 (MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367 per Gaudron J, Gummow J and Kirby J). 
     
      
    102 For each of the reasons I have given, I would allow the appeal against conviction on counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14.  
     
      
    103 I have not so far dealt with count 1 in the indictment. Count 1 contained two alleged representations, a representation by the appellant that he was a solicitor and a representation by the appellant that he would invest the money advanced.  
     
      
    104 The first alleged representation, that the appellant was a solicitor, was clearly a representation as to a matter of fact. There was much evidence, which it was open to the jury to accept, that the appellant did represent to Mr Birk that he was a solicitor, that that representation was false, that Mr Birk believed that the representation was true and that the representation was a cause of the appellant obtaining the sum of $10,000 from Mr Birk. 
     
      
    105 The second alleged representation was a representation that the appellant would invest the money advanced and the criticisms I have previously made about a similar alleged representation in the other counts in the indictment are applicable to this second alleged representation.  
     
      
    106 In his summing-up the trial judge directed the jury, that the jury could convict the appellant on count 1, if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, either that the accused represented that he was a solicitor or that the accused represented that he would invest the money (provided, of course, that the other elements of the offence were established beyond reasonable doubt). The trial judge was correct in directing the jury that where the Crown alleges two representations it would be sufficient for the Crown to prove all the elements of the offence with respect to either one of the representations. 
     
      
    107 It would clearly have been open to the jury to convict the appellant on the first basis. However, for reasons which I have given, I do not consider it would have been open to the jury to convict the appellant on the second basis. As one of the two alternative bases on which the trial judge directed the jury that the appellant could be found guilty was not legally open, I find that error occurred.  
     
      
    108 However, I would apply the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. I have reviewed the whole record of the trial and I consider that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellant’s guilt on the first count on the first basis put to the jury, namely that the appellant falsely represented that he was a solicitor. There was no significant denial of procedural fairness at the trial and I see no reason for not finding that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred in the conviction of the appellant on count 1. Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81 especially at pars 43-47. 
     
      
    109 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction on count 1. 
     
      
    110 I have concluded that the appeal against conviction should be allowed on counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 but should be dismissed on count 1. It is accordingly necessary to consider the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    111 The appellant’s seventh ground of appeal was that, in sentencing the appellant, the trial judge had not had regard to “extraneous” bail obligations. It became apparent at the hearing of the appeal that the ground of appeal was that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account what were submitted to have been onerous bail conditions, namely reporting conditions. 
     
      
    112 The appellant was on bail for a protracted period because of the long delay in his trial being held. One of the conditions on which he was granted bail was that he report to police daily. Subsequently the reporting condition was varied so as to require him to report only once a week.  
     
      
    113 The reporting conditions to which the appellant was subject while he was on bail were far less burdensome than the bail conditions amounting to quasi-custody in an institution, which have been held in some cases to warrant a reduction in sentence. I would dismiss this ground of appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    114 The second ground of appeal against sentence (ground 8), that the sentencing judge erred in imposing cumulative sentences, has been overtaken by my decision to allow the appellant’s appeal against conviction on all counts except count 1. 
     
      
    115 The sentence the trial judge imposed on count 1, of imprisonment for fourteen months with a non-parole period of seven months to be served by way of periodic detention, seems to me to be an appropriate, if not a lenient, sentence on count 1 and I would confirm that sentence. 
     
      
    116 I would propose the following orders:- 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction on counts 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 allowed, with the consequence that the convictions and sentences on those counts are quashed. Verdicts of acquittal entered on these counts. 
       
      2. Appeal against conviction on count 1 dismissed. 
       
      3. Leave to appeal against the sentence on count 1 granted but appeal against sentence on count 1 dismissed. 
       
      4. Sentence on count 1 confirmed. 
       
      
    117 BUDDIN J: I agree with James J

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Subject to the following additional observations, I agree with the judgment of Adams J which I have read in draft. 
     
      
    2 A discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of 20 percent was well within the range of her Honour’s discretion. It is not the case that a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity must necessarily attract a 25 percent discount. 
     
      
    3 When applying the Henry guideline as a check or indicator when there are multiple offences, it is always important to have regard to the issue of accumulation. There is no single correct sequence by which the applicable sentencing principles must be applied, particularly because it may become necessary to review the various elements after resolving an appropriate sentence for each individual offence from the perspective of totality. 
     
      
    4 I agree with the orders Adams J proposes. Each of the three armed robbery offences would, even in the face of the strong subjective case, justify a longer sentence, but the degree of accumulation proposed by his Honour, which has the effect of adding 12 months to the non-parole period and to the head sentence, is such as to justify the sentence proposed for each offence in the circumstances. 
     
      
    5 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgments of the Chief Justice and Adams J. Two issues arise. 
     
      
    6 The first concerns the discount allowed to the respondent in respect of his pleas of guilty. The sentencing judge allowed 20%. Adams J expresses the view that, unless good reason the contrary were shown, the respondent was entitled to a discount of 25%, at the top of the range specified in the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. The Chief Justice is of a contrary view. 
     
      
    7 I respectfully agree with the Chief Justice. In Thomson and Houlton a range of 10 – 25% was promulgated as the appropriate range by which to reduce a sentence in recognition of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. A number of factors are relevant to the assessment of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. In Thomson and Houlton it was held that the primary consideration is the timing of the plea. No doubt this is because an early plea brings to a halt the expenditure of funds, time and resources on the preparation of a prosecution, and the release of those resources for the preparation and prosecution of other cases. Here, the respondent’s plea was an early one. He was arrested on 31 December 2004, and entered his plea of guilty on 8 March 2005 in the Queanbeyan Local Court. It is not clear whether there was, in a real sense, any earlier opportunity formally to enter a plea. On his arrest, the respondent initially declined to comment. However, on 5 January 2005, after consultation with legal representatives, he requested a further interview and made full admissions. He repeated these admissions in a further interview on 10 January 2005, and again on 11 January 2005. These admissions, in my view, made pleas of guilty inevitable, and signalled clearly his intention to enter such pleas. Although the sentencing judge made no express finding to that effect, in my view this Court should proceed on the basis that the pleas were made at the earliest available opportunity. 
     
      
    8 That, however, does not necessarily entail the conclusion that he was entitled to a discount at the very top of the Thomson and Houlton range. Other factors besides timing are relevant to the assessment of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. One is the likely duration and/or complexity of the trial that has been avoided. Another is the potential cost of such a trial – involving circumstances such as the need to transport witnesses long distances, or to assemble complex evidentiary material. Those factors, in this case, do not favour the respondent. The trial would have been neither long nor complex; the witnesses were all local; while video evidence would have been tendered, it does not appear to be such as would have generated great expense. 
     
      
    9 In these circumstances, it was open to the sentencing judge to find, as he impliedly did, that the utilitarian value of the pleas was marginally less than the maximum specified in the guideline. 
     
      
    10 The more substantial issue is whether any error has been shown on the part of the sentencing judge. This Court has recently been forcefully reminded of its role in adjudicating appeals against sentence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 79 ALJR 1048. It is only where some specific error of principle is demonstrated, or the result is unreasonable or “plainly unjust”, that it may interfere. In my opinion the key to the present appeal lies in the principle of totality. The task of the sentencing judge was to impose, in respect of each offence, a sentence appropriate to the criminality disclosed by that offence: The Queen v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. I take this to mean a sentence appropriate to that offence if it were being dealt with in isolation from the others – if it were the only offence for which the respondent stood for sentence. 
     
      
    11 On behalf the Crown it was submitted that the sentences imposed, particularly in respect of the armed robbery offences, were unreasonable in that sense, or “plainly unjust” in the sense that they failed to recognise the level of objective criminality. Adams J finds no error in this respect in any of the sentences imposed. I agree. In coming to this view, I recognise that, having regard to the objective seriousness of (at least) the armed robbery offences, the sentences imposed were very lenient. However, having regard to the other relevant circumstances, particularly the respondent’s 45-year (at the time of the offences) history of abiding by the law, I am not persuaded that they were so lenient as to bespeak error. I would join Adams J in rejecting this aspect of the Crown’s submission. If the offences of armed robbery stood alone, I would regard the sentences imposed in respect of them as lenient, but not appellably so. 
     
      
    12 In coming to that view, I bear in mind that the respondent’s psychiatric condition is relevant: Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21. So also, as I have already mentioned, is his prior good character. Also relevant (marginally) is the ineptitude displayed in the commission of the offences. In one case the respondent sought, by flourishing a knife, to have a service station operator unlock the doors. As Adams J has observed, it is unsurprising that this attempt failed. Only a few minutes later, he managed, by brandishing the knife, to obtain money, but the console operator followed him, armed only with a piece of timber, and was able to retrieve the money. This, perhaps, is some indication of just how threatening the respondent appeared. On a third occasion the respondent demanded money by claiming to be in possession of a gun, but the operator soon realised that this was not the case and refused to produce the money sought. 
     
      
    13 When sentencing for multiple offences, a judge must have one eye on the totality of the criminality. The aggregate of the sentences imposed must match the aggregate of the criminality displayed. 
     
      
    14 That raises the question of accumulation or concurrency. In R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 I observed that whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is an exercise of discretion to be carried out in accordance with established principles. That passage has been adopted on a number of occasions. One circumstance pointing to concurrency rather than accumulation are features common to two or more offences the subject of sentencing. In this case there were many features that were common. The respondent embarked upon a quite inexplicable course of criminal conduct over a very short period of time – just three weeks. True it is that the offences were (for the most part) committed in different places, and involved different victims, but they may properly be regarded, in my opinion, as a single course of conduct. While I recognise that many judges would give greater weight to those features of the offences that were disparate, I am not able to conclude that it was not open to the sentencing judge to regard the respondent’s conduct as a single course of criminal endeavour. That would permit the imposition of fully concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    15 There was thus no error either in the length of the sentences, nor in the conclusion that the circumstances of the offences permitted an order that they be served concurrently. But that then raises the question of totality. I have concluded that, in the light of the total criminality, the combination of very lenient sentences, together with total concurrency, renders the aggregate of the sentences manifestly inadequate. I agree, therefore, that the Crown appeal ought to be allowed in part, and the respondent re-sentenced. The error may be corrected either by extending the sentences imposed in respect of the armed robbery offences, or, as proposed by Adams J, by making some sentences partially cumulative. My preference would be for the former course, but, since the same result is achieved by the orders proposed by Adams J, I am prepared to concur in those orders. 
     
      
    16 I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J. 
     
      
    17 ADAMS J: Introduction 
     
      
    18 On 17 November 2005 the respondent was sentenced following his pleas of guilty on six charges as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) armed robbery (maximum penalty twenty years’ imprisonment) on 30 December 2004 – three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing 31 December 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) armed robbery on 8 December 2004 – three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing 31 December 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) larceny (maximum penalty five years’ imprisonment) on 10 December 2004 – eighteen months with a non-parole period of nine months commencing 31 December 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) armed robbery on 22 December 2004 – three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing 31 December 2004; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) attempted armed robbery (maximum penalty twenty years’ imprisonment) on 30 December 2004 – three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing on 31 December 2004; and 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) assault with intent to rob (maximum penalty fourteen years’ imprisonment) on 21 December 2004 – two years with a non-parole period of twelve months commencing 31 December 2004. 
        
       
      
    19 It will be seen that the effective punishment for the six offences was three years with eighteen months non-parole commencing 31 December 2004, all sentences having been ordered to be served wholly concurrently. The Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice of appeal from all sentences on 23 November 2005. The notice was served on 28 November 2005. There is, I think, an error of one day in the dates specified in the orders of the District for the expiration of the non-parole period.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
        
       
      
    20 The facts of the offences were not in dispute. The following narrative is taken from the reasons for sentence of the learned sentencing judge together with some details from the Crown material which was tendered in the proceedings.  
     
      
    21 At about 9 pm on Wednesday 8 December 2004, the respondent entered a service station in Lanyon Drive, Queanbeyan. He was carrying a kitchen knife with a 30 cm blade. He demanded money from the console operator, screaming (amongst other things), “This is a hold-up. Empty the till and give me the money or I will kill ya.” The respondent ordered the operator to put money inside the plastic shopping bag placed on the counter. The operator complied but the respondent demanded more money, threatening violence and brandishing the knife. The operator placed more money in the bag. The respondent ordered him to lie on the floor and, when he did so, made his escape. The respondent took $300.  
     
      
    22 Two days later, on Friday 10 December 2004 at about 2 pm, the respondent parked in the drive-through area of a tavern at Jerrabomberra, walked through the premises to behind the main bar, picked up a cash tin containing $400 and walked back to his car and drove off. A witness noticed that the registration plate was covered with cardboard.  
     
      
    23 Just over a week later, on 21 December 2004, the respondent returned to the Lanyon Drive service station, pretending to have a firearm concealed in the sleeve of his jacket. He demanded money, saying he had a gun and threatening to kill the console operator. The operator opened the cash register to hand over money but realised that the respondent, in fact, did not have a gun and desisted. The respondent then screamed further threats but walked out when the operator refused to comply.  
     
      
    24 On the following day, 22 December 2004, the respondent approached another service station in Cooma Road, Queanbeyan. The doors were locked as the console operator was closing up. Seeing the respondent at the door, the operator let him in. The respondent concealed his face with the hood of a jumper and produced a kitchen knife with a blade. He said, “I want to kill people, I want to stab people. No, I just want money, give me, give me money.” He handed a shopping bag to the operator and demanded that he put money in it. The operator did so. The respondent then required him to lie on the floor. The respondent fled in a motor vehicle with the number plates concealed with cardboard. The respondent took $900.  
     
      
    25 On 30 December 2004, the respondent approached the locked doors of a service station in Bungendore Road, Queanbeyan. He was carrying a knife with a 30 cm blade and motioned with it for the console operator to open the doors. The operator, not surprisingly, refused. The respondent unsuccessfully attempted to open the doors with the knife and then with his hands. He then left and about ten minutes later went for the third time to the Lanyon Drive service station. Brandishing the knife, he threatened to kill the console operator and demanded money. The operator complied. The respondent left with the money but was followed by the operator who had armed himself with a piece of timber. The operator demanded the return of the money. The respondent told him, “Get away or I’ll fucking kill ya.” However, the operator persisted in his demands for the return of the money and the respondent dropped the bag. He got into his car, parked nearby and drove away. The vehicle’s number plates were covered with cardboard. The operator had placed $200 in the bag.  
     
      
    26 Shortly after the last offence, the police closed off the entry and exit points to the locality. A search of the local area discovered the respondent’s vehicle. He was arrested shortly after. Although he declined to make admissions at first, in early January the respondent spoke to the police at his own instigation and made candid admissions of his involvement in the offences. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features 
       
      
    27 The respondent had no criminal history. Considering the nature of the offences, this was not only most unusual but for reasons I mention later, of some significance. There was no dispute at the sentencing proceeding concerning the subjective features affecting the respondent. The following is largely taken from the reasons for sentence of the learned sentencing judge but I have, once more, added some brief details from the other material that was tendered. 
     
      
    28 The offender was born on 22 June 1959 and, accordingly, was some forty-five years of age at the time of the offences. He was born in Finland and came to Australia with his family in 1961. He had a good employment record, starting with heavy work as a young man and culminating as the manager of a large wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products. The respondent lived in a de facto relationship for over twenty-two years until his excessive drinking and some other factors caused the relationship to break up. At the time, it appeared that the respondent was under intense pressure at his job but he was also gambling, not surprisingly, unsuccessfully. He had a serious problem with alcohol. At the time of the offences he had been consuming four to five litres of cask wine daily for some months. His gambling had resulted in considerable debt.  
     
      
    29 Mr Hugh Jolly, a psychologist, assessed the respondent some three months after the commission of the offences. He was then in prison on remand. The respondent had by then dried out. He expressed contrition, which Mr Jolly accepted as genuine as did the sentencing judge. It was reasonable also to infer that the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation were good. In Mr Jolly’s opinion, at the time the respondent committed the offences, “he was suffering from recognisable psychiatric disorder, probably major depressive disorder, with marked obsessive-compulsive content and alcohol abuse”. Mr Jolly thought that “his cognitive processes were adversely affected by the huge quantity of alcohol he had consumed daily over weeks and months” which severely comprised his ability to reason and plan with any composure. Mr Jolly considered that, when he saw the respondent, he had improved greatly although he remained reactively depressed. He thought that the respondent had “proper awareness” of what had happened in the recent past and, although he was not symptom free, he “no longer assessed him as suffering major psychiatric illness”. Mr Jolly’s report contained a lengthy and detailed history give by the respondent which it is not necessary to set out in any detail. The evidence of severe depression included the respondent’s indifference to chaotic and filthy domestic circumstances and his own personal hygiene. It is sufficient to note that it appears that the respondent’s serious alcohol addiction commenced when he began to drink excessively as a way of dealing with the tensions and demands of his employment, becoming serious perhaps two or three years before the offences but steadily worsening, exacerbated by the respondent’s gambling habit. The break up of his relationship also caused considerable anguish and, in January 2004, he self-mutilated very seriously with a kitchen knife following an argument with his wife.  
     
      
    30 The conclusion that the respondent’s compromised psychological state was a significant contributing factor to the offences is supported, as it seems to me, by the completely aberrant conduct which they comprised, when compared with the law-abiding character of his life hitherto. 
     
      
    31 The probation and parole report contains material along the same lines as that referred to by Mr Jolly. The report added that the respondent had been well behaved in prison. He had been assessed upon his arrival as a suicide risk but within a short time this abated and the prison psychologist who was seeing him at first no longer needed to do so.  
     
      
    32 The respondent expressed profound regret for the offences and particularly for the harm he had caused his victims. He told the probation and parole officer that he was at a loss to understand how his life could have deteriorated to the point where he resorted to committing these serious crimes. The learned sentencing judge concluded (rightly in my view) that the respondent was contrite. I should add that the respondent gave evidence in the sentence proceedings, relating in substance the histories that he had given to Mr Jolly and the probation and parole officer and describing the downward spiral in his domestic and financial position. Not only was he taking alcohol but also up to eight times the prescribed daily dose of Cyprimil (an anti-depressant drug), taking tablets from his employer’s warehouse for this purpose. Cyprimil had been prescribed for him by his doctor but the respondent increased his intake from his employer’s stores when he felt no benefit from taking only the prescribed quantity. 
     
      
    33 There was evidence, accepted by the learned sentencing judge, that the applicant was supported by his siblings who visited him in prison and were assisting him financially.  
     
      
    34 The learned sentencing judge described the offender’s subjective circumstances as “very compelling” and noted that, although the crimes he had committed were serious, they were “nowhere near the higher end of the scale of criminality that one sees in this Court.”  
     
      
       
      Objective circumstances 
       
      
    35 Although it appears that the offences had some elements of planning, for example, the respondent took a knife, wore black clothes and a balaclava on some of the occasions and covered the number plates of his motor vehicle with cardboard. At the same time, the offences were provoked by a degree of impulsivity during occasions when he became extremely depressed. The offences were largely captured on CCTV, the respondent used his own vehicle, which he parked nearby, to escape and, it is obvious from the facts already related, exhibited some marked amateurish features. 
     
      
       
      Events following arrest 
        
       
      
    36 As I have mentioned, the respondent made full and frank admissions about the offences shortly after his arrest. He pleaded guilty to the charges at the committal proceedings and adhered to his pleas in the District Court. As the Crown prosecutor conceded in this Court, he certainly pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The learned sentencing judge allowed a utilitarian discount on the respondent’s sentences of 20%. It is difficult to see why the respondent could not have been given the full usual discount of 25%: see R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 418. The respondent’s pleas saved a considerable amount of court time and, of perhaps greater significance, obviated the necessity for the victims to give evidence. In this Court, the Crown prosecutor candidly conceded that the respondent had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Quite rightly, this matter was not a ground of appeal: allowing the respondent a 20% utilitarian discount was clearly within the learned sentencing judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    37 Given the public policy considerations clearly enunciated in that judgment, especially the importance of transparency, it is most desirable that, where a sentencing Court does not follow what might be thought to be the usual implications of a plea history, the reasons for not doing so are made clear. It should be assumed that counsel for an offender has discussed the significance of a plea with the client and it is important to enable a prediction to be given – of course within a reasonable range, considering the discretion reposed in the sentencing judge – with some certainty. I return to this matter in due course. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    38 The appropriate starting point when considering sentences for armed robbery is, for obvious reasons, the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, especially at 380, where Spigelman CJ said –  
     
      
       
        
        “161 In the cases now before this Court, the Crown has propounded a starting point for New South Wales of six years full term, in circumstances where there is a plea of guilty.  
        
       
       
        
        162 It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline:  
         
         
          
          (i) Young offender with no or little criminal history;  
           
          (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;  
           
          (iii) Limited degree of planning;  
           
          (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;  
           
          (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;  
           
          (vi) Small amount taken;  
           
          (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.  
           
           
          163 Whilst it is possible to determine a starting point in a case of this kind, i.e. a sentence of X years imprisonment, I do not believe that the Court should do so. Rather, I propose the Court should identify a narrow sentencing range within which this Court would expect sentences in such cases to fall.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        164 There are two principal reasons why a sentencing range is appropriate for this offence: 
         
         
          
          (i) The seven characteristics identified above do not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise.  
           
          (ii) Many of the seven identified characteristics contain within themselves an inherent variability, eg different kinds of knives or weapons in (ii); extent of ""limited actual violence"" in (iv); degree of vulnerability in (v); amount in (vi).  
           
          
         
        165 In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term.” 
        
       
      
    39 The circumstances of this case reflect, with one exception, what might usefully be called the Henry factors. The exception is that the respondent was about forty-five years of age at the date of the offences and accordingly could not be regarded as a youthful offender. The Crown has submitted this is a neutral fact. Except in the sense that it gives some insight into a precipitating cause of the respondent’s criminal behaviour, I agree with this submission. The fact that a person of mature years commits serious offences will generally be regarded as more culpable than where such offences are committed by a youthful offender. However, the circumstances here, because of the factors that contributed to the respondent’s offending, do not justify an upward departure from the Henry guidelines because of the respondent’s maturity.  
     
      
    40 It was also suggested during argument that the respondent to some extent was “better off than Henry” because there was no victim impact statement or other material suggesting that the victims suffered, as I understand it, significant anguish or anxiety or psychological injury. A victim impact statement is not evidence of injury, unless the offender consents to its being used for that purpose. More fundamentally, the absence of such a statement does not justify the inference that there was no adverse effect upon the victim caused by the offence. As Howie J said, in Bechar v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 1 at [22], “…the court assumes that the effect upon a victim of an armed robbery is substantial and this is taken into account in the penalty to be imposed…[whilst] evidence of a long lasting effect on the victim…might have been a matter of aggravation”. In this case there was no evidence of aggravation, but the absence of evidence of effect on the victims, let alone absence of a victim impact statement, did not permit any reduction in the application of the Henry guideline. I mention this matter simply to correct an impression that might otherwise have been conveyed by the argument. The learned sentencing judge did not imply in his Honour’s reasons for sentence that he had regard to the absence of material showing the effects of the offences on the victims. 
     
      
    41 The Henry factors, together with other circumstances that might be significant in particular cases, cannot sensibly be weighed with finely adjusted scales. Human motivations, the relationship between psychological dysfunction, adverse life occurrences in domestic or employment contexts, decision-making and moral culpability are, inherently, not susceptible to precise calculation, still less for the purposes of the criminal law. A broad commonsense approach, focused on the purposes of sentencing is called for. So considered, applying the Henry factors to the present case suggests sentences for the armed robberies should be placed at the higher end of the guidelines. 
     
      
    42 However, when allowance is made for the respondent’s psychologically compromised state, the aberrant character of the offences in light of the respondent’s prior good character, the remorse and contrition he has exhibited and his prospects for rehabilitation, I am not persuaded, in respect of the armed robbery offences (including the assault with the intent to commit robbery) that the learned sentencing judge’s apparent starting point, before the utilitarian discount, of just under four years is manifestly inadequate. Even if it were, the inadequacy is not so great as to require this Court to intervene, especially when, (as I think ought to have been done) a utilitarian discount of 25% rather than 20% should have been allowed. It seems to me, furthermore, that no complaint of inadequacy can be made out so far as the offences of larceny and attempted armed robbery are involved. In this respect, I note that the Crown prosecutor in this Court did not press such an argument upon us.  
     
      
    43 Accordingly, I would not vary the lengths of the sentences imposed in the District Court.  
     
      
    44 The question of the extent of concurrency, however, is quite distinct. The learned sentencing judge said that he took the view that “the crimes, all committed over a period of about three weeks, were really all part of the one chapter of criminal activity” and his Honour did not see that accumulation was called for. I respectfully differ from his Honour’s view. It seems to me that the offences committed on 30 December (attempted armed robbery and armed robbery) are so closely connected in point of time and place as to be fairly regarded as a single episode of criminal conduct. Similarly, the offences committed on 21 and 22 December (assault with attempt to rob and armed robbery) warranted concurrency for the same reason. I would not accept that complete concurrency was appropriate in the latter two cases, in particular, because there were two victims but the extent of accumulation would be relatively slight and in the context of a Crown appeal, would not be such as to require the intervention of this Court. The larceny offence committed on 10 December is relatively trivial. Indeed, standing alone, it would, I think, scarcely warrant a term of imprisonment. It was committed only two days after the first offence. In all the circumstances, making the sentence imposed for this offence completely concurrent with that imposed for the first offence was, in my view, correct.  
     
      
    45 This analysis leaves three connected sets of offences. I consider that, some accumulation was required adequately to reflect the criminality involved and that the failure to do so was an error. These sets of offences occurred as distinct episodes of serious criminality, albeit as parts of a series of offences within a limited timeframe. I do not see how the sentences for the second and third episodes could properly have been entirely subsumed in the sentences imposed for the first episode. Of course, this is a matter of fact and degree and there is no bright line. However, so serious are offences that involve threats to life or limb by the use of a weapon, in this case accompanied by the brandishing of a large knife, where they occur on separate occasions and with different victims, some accumulation will usually be necessary to reflect the gravity of the criminality involved. In my view, an accumulation was not only justified in the present case, it was required. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    46 For the sake of completeness I should add that, with respect, the learned sentencing judge’s finding that there were special circumstances justifying a substantial variation of the statutory calculus is correct. In the sentences that I propose, therefore, I have not varied that ratio. As I have mentioned, I think that the respondent was entitled in the circumstances to the utilitarian discount of 25% in accordance with the judgment of this Court in Thomson and Houlton. The proposed sentences include an adjustment in favour of the respondent to reflect this point of view. I have done this by lessening the extent of accumulation which would otherwise have been appropriate. In the nature of the exercise, this cannot be done arithmetically: I have simply made an assessment which reflects the discount. 
     
      
       
      Proposed orders 
       
      
    47 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. In respect of the sentences for the offences committed on 8 December 2004 (armed robbery) and 10 December 2004 (larceny) the appeals are dismissed.  
        
       
       
        
        2.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Susan Betty Rend appealed against her conviction on one charge of robbery. In the event of her appeal against conviction being dismissed, she applies for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on her. 
     
      
    2 The appellant’s trial took place in January 2005 in the District Court before his Honour Judge Nield and a jury. At the trial the appellant was arraigned on an indictment containing three counts, to all of which she pleaded not guilty, namely a charge of robbery while armed with an offensive weapon (count 1), an alternative charge of robbery (count 2) and a charge of larceny of a motor vehicle (count 3). All of the offences were alleged to have been committed on 1 September 2003. The jury found the appellant not guilty on counts 1 and 3 and guilty on count 2. For the offence of robbery Judge Nield imposed a total sentence of four years, with a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 25 January 2005. In ordering that the sentence should commence on 25 January 2005, his Honour took into account periods of pre-sentence custody. For a related offence of driving while disqualified his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for six months also commencing on 25 January 2005. 
     
      
    3 It was the Crown case at the trial that the offence of robbery (if not armed robbery) had been committed by the appellant with a co-offender, a male named Kurt Wormleaton. Wormleaton had pleaded guilty to charges of armed robbery, stealing a motor vehicle and being in possession of implements capable of being used to enter and drive a motor vehicle. He had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, which he was serving at the time of the appellant’s trial. At the appellant’s trial Wormleaton gave evidence for the Crown. 
     
      
    4 On 26 May 2004 the appellant had herself pleaded guilty to a charge of armed robbery on 1 September 2003 and a charge of driving and being carried in a stolen motor vehicle on 1 September 2003. In May 2004 the appellant’s legal representatives were Mr Charles Abbott, a solicitor, and Mr Greg Walsh, a barrister. Mr Abbott had a conference with the appellant on 4 May 2004 at which Mr Abbott took notes and, at Mr Abbott’s request, the appellant prepared a handwritten statement dated 17 May 2004 in which she gave an account of events happening on 31 August 2003 and 1 September 2003. Mr Walsh made notes of conferences he had with the appellant in May 2004. 
     
      
    5 The appellant subsequently applied for leave to withdraw her pleas of guilty. An affidavit by Mr Walsh was filed in opposition to this application. An annexure to this affidavit was a copy of the appellant’s handwritten statement of 17 May 2004. Other annexures to the affidavit included notes by Mr Walsh of conferences he had had with the appellant in May 2004. The appellant was granted leave to withdraw her pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    6 At the trial the principal Crown witnesses were the alleged co-offender Wormleaton and the alleged victim of the robbery, Mr Cade Hampstead.  
     
      
       
      Wormleaton’s Evidence  
       
      
    7 The evidence in chief given by Wormleaton can be briefly summarised as follows. 
     
      
    8 In August 2003 Wormleaton and the appellant were living together in a townhouse at Kingswood. The appellant had two children but Wormleaton was not the father of either child. The first day of September was the birthday of one of the appellant’s children. Neither the appellant nor Wormleaton had any money with which to buy a birthday present for the appellant’s child.  
     
      
    9 On the evening of 31 August 2003 Wormleaton and the appellant left the townhouse together. Wormleaton, at least, had made a decision to rob someone to obtain money. Before leaving the townhouse, Wormleaton took a set of car opening keys and a knife out of a drawer and put them in his pocket. 
     
      
    10 Wormleaton and the appellant went looking for a car to steal. Wormleaton broke into a parked car by using his car opening keys. At the time Wormleaton broke into the car, the appellant was “waiting down the road about 300 metres”. Wormleaton picked up the appellant and Wormleaton drove the stolen car along the Great Western Highway in the direction of Sydney, with the appellant in the front passenger seat. 
     
      
    11 At Parramatta Wormleaton stole registration number plates from another vehicle and substituted them for the number plates on the vehicle which had been stolen. At Wormleaton’s request, the appellant passed to Wormleaton the screwdriver which Wormleaton used to remove the number plates from the second vehicle. Wormleaton disposed of the number plates which had been on the stolen vehicle. 
     
      
    12 Wormleaton drove the stolen car into the city, looking for someone to rob. However, it was “too crowded” in the city, that is there were too many people in the streets for a successful robbery.  
     
      
    13 In the city Wormleaton and the appellant “changed drivers… so it was easier for me to get in and out (of the car) to rob someone”. The car had a manual gear transmission and the appellant had difficulty in driving it. 
     
      
    14 The appellant drove the stolen vehicle into Newtown. Wormleaton spotted a victim, who was a pedestrian walking in the opposite direction to that in which the vehicle was travelling. Wormleaton told the appellant to pull over. Wormleaton got out of the vehicle and approached the victim. Wormleaton drew the knife, asked the victim what money he had and robbed the victim of ten dollars which the victim produced from his wallet. 
     
      
    15 Wormleaton then got back into the stolen vehicle, sitting in the front passenger seat.  
     
      
    16 Wormleaton and the appellant stopped at a shop to buy some cigarettes. They then got back into the vehicle, with Wormleaton taking over the driving. A little later they were stopped by police.  
     
      
    17 In cross-examination Wormleaton agreed that during the day of 31 August 2003 he had seen the appellant consuming tablets but he did not know what tablets she had taken. At different times on the journey during the night of 31 August –1 September he had seen the appellant “on the nod”. 
     
      
       
      Mr Hampstead’s Evidence  
       
      
    18 Mr Hampstead gave evidence that in the early hours of 1 September 2003 he was walking along King Street, Newtown on his way home. He was the only person in the street. A car travelling in the opposite direction passed him, slowing down as it did so. Mr Hampstead kept walking but then heard someone running up behind him. It was a man armed with a knife. Mr Hampstead recognised the man as being the person in the front passenger seat of the car which had passed him. The man asked Mr Hampstead what money he had and Mr Hampstead produced ten dollars. The man took the ten dollars and ran back to the car, which had stopped about fifty metres away. The man got into the front passenger seat of the car. The driver of the car was a female. 
     
      
    19 Very shortly after being robbed Mr Hampstead made an emergency telephone call to police. A tape recording and a transcript of the emergency telephone call were admitted into evidence. In the telephone call Mr Hampstead said that he had just been robbed at knifepoint and was watching the car drive away. When asked how many offenders there were, he said “one driver and one assaulter. Female driver, male assaulter”. He confirmed “one female driver and a male passenger”. Later in the conversation Mr Hampstead said that the car was just driving past him. Mr Hampstead supplied the registration number on the number plates on the vehicle and it was the supplying of this information that led to the vehicle being stopped by police. 
     
      
       
      Other Crown Evidence  
       
      
    20 A police officer Constable Park read, without objection, a statement he had made. In his statement he said that in the early morning of 1 September 2003 he had been in a police vehicle, performing highway patrol duties. The police vehicle had chased the vehicle in which Wormleaton and the appellant were, in a chase beginning in Newtown, and Wormleaton and the appellant had been arrested. Constable Park was briefly cross-examined by counsel for the appellant at the trial. Constable Park was not asked either in examination in chief or in cross-examination any question about any observation he might have made of the state of intoxication or sobriety of the appellant at the time she was arrested. 
     
      
    21 Statements by other police officers were admitted, without objection. None of these officers said anything about any observations which the officer might have made of the condition of the appellant at the time she was arrested. 
     
      
    22 The statement of 17 May 2004 which the appellant had made to her then solicitor Mr Abbott was tendered by the Crown and admitted into evidence as part of the Crown case (exhibit “S”). 
     
      
    23 On the hearing of this appeal it was not disputed that the trial judge had been correct in ruling that client legal privilege had been waived by the appellant by the disclosure and use of the statement in the application for leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty. The trial judge rejected a submission made by counsel for the appellant at the trial that the trial judge should refuse to admit evidence of the statement in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 90 of the Evidence Act. However, the trial judge did exercise the discretion conferred by s 90 in favour of the appellant, so as to reject a tender by the Crown of the notes Mr Abbott had made of his conference with the appellant on 4 May 2004. 
     
      
    24 In the statement of 17 May 2004 the appellant gave a detailed account of what she said had happened on the night of 31 August-1 September 2003. She said that Wormleaton “suggested he would see his friend from the area of Kingswood to get permission to lend his car”. She said that Wormleaton had turned up at the townhouse in a car and had said that the two of them should go to the city to visit a cousin of Wormleaton’s, who lived near Central. While Wormleaton and the appellant were in the car there were arguments between them, because they were unable to find where the cousin lived. The appellant’s statement continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Anyways he kept driving around like we were going in circles and another argument started but bigger and then he stopped the car ordered me to get out and drive, so I drove and then by that stage we were very lost. Now neither of us knew where we were, so then we both took some pills and then kept driving and things became a bit hazy, so I kept driving looking round at the night life around and seemed like we were getting even more lost, then all of a sudden Kurt ordered me to pull over, it was a fairly busy street, even at a late hour he said he seen a telephone box and said wait here, I’ll go and ring my cousin and see if he was still up and to get directions to his house and to see if he still want to go out, while he went to call I waited in the car, Kurt came back jumped into the passenger seat and ordered me to drive so I did, and I noticed he was happy and excited, as I drove on he said to me he had just rolled someone I had been furious with him, so I pulled into a 7 Eleven and was so disgusted in what he told me he’d done in no uncertain terms but I also was disgusted with the situation he’d put me in as a mother and as his friend, and that his stupid criminal act could get me into trouble as well.” 
        
       
       
      The Appellant’s Evidence at the Trial 
       
      
    25 The appellant gave evidence and her evidence was the only evidence in the defence case.  
     
      
    26 In her evidence the appellant said that in August 2003 she had been living in a relationship with Wormleaton. On 31 August 2003 she had taken Valium and “I was on methadone and alcohol”. She was “stoned”.  
     
      
    27 In the afternoon of 31 August Wormleaton went out without her and later returned with a car.  
     
      
    28 Wormleaton suggested that they should go out together in the car and visit a cousin of his in the city. Wormleaton drove the car and the appellant did not drive the car at all that night. She did not see Wormleaton take a knife from the house but later she saw a knife in the console of the vehicle. The appellant did not remember the car stopping at Parramatta. While she was in the car “I was smashed, like on the nod sort of thing, nodding off and waking up”. 
     
      
    29 Wormleaton, who was driving the car, said that he would telephone his cousin and Wormleaton stopped the car and got out. A little later Wormleaton returned to the vehicle and got back into the driver’s seat. Wormleaton stopped the car at a shop to buy cigarettes. Subsequently, the car was stopped by police. The appellant thought that the car had been stopped because Wormleaton, who had been disqualified from driving, should not have been driving. The appellant said that she first learnt about the robbery when she was told by the police that a robbery had been committed.  
     
      
    30 The appellant was then asked questions by her counsel about the statement of 17 May 2004 which she had made to Mr Abbott. The following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And are the majority of the things in it the truth, apart from the areas where you say that you drove the car because Kurt told you to drive” 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
       
       …….. 
       
       
        
        “Q. Why did you say that you drove the car when you’d originally told your solicitor that you didn’t drive the car? 
         
        A. Because um when, I remember being in a conference with him and he’s just more or less told me to tell him what happened”. 
        
       
       
       ….. 
       
       
        
        “Q. So you’re telling the jury is that you decided to change that part of your story because you thought it would be more believable, is that right? 
         
        A. Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you drive that car that night? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
      
    31 In her evidence in cross-examination the appellant said that, while she was in the vehicle on the night of 31 August-1 September, she had been “stoned” and “on the nod”, meaning that most of the time she had been nodding off to sleep and, in that condition, it would have been impossible for her to drive. 
     
      
    32 The appellant was cross-examined about her statement of 17 May 2004 and inconsistencies between that statement and evidence she had given in her evidence in chief. 
     
      
    33 The appellant said in cross-examination that she had not known that Wormleaton was going to get a car, until he came back to the townhouse with a car. What she had said in her statement of 17 May 2004 about Wormleaton saying that he would see a local friend to obtain permission to borrow a car was untrue and she had put that assertion in her statement because Mr Abbott her solicitor had told her to. She had told Mr Abbott what had really happened and “he didn’t believe me”. 
     
      
    34 In cross-examination it was put to the appellant by the Crown prosecutor that she was saying that her statement in her letter was a lie and she agreed. It was put to her that her evidence, that Mr Abbott had told her to say what she had said in her statement, was a lie but she denied that it was a lie. 
     
      
    35 The appellant said in cross-examination that what she had said in her statement of 17 May 2004 about Wormleaton telling her that he had “rolled” someone was untrue and that Mr Abbott had told her to write that. It was put to her by the Crown prosecutor, but the appellant denied, that it was a lie that Mr Abbott had told her to write that in her statement. 
     
      
    36 In cross-examination the appellant denied that she had ever driven the vehicle on the night of 31 August-1 September and she had said in her statement of 17 May 2004 that she had at times driven the vehicle “because my old solicitor told me to”. Mr Abbott had said to the appellant “that would be more believable”. 
     
      
    37 Subsequently in cross-examination the appellant agreed that in her statement of 17 May 2004 she had given a version of events which was full of lies and she had given that version because Mr Abbott had told her to. 
     
      
       
      Crown Case in Reply 
       
      
    38 At the trial the Crown prosecutor indicated that he wished to call Mr Abbott in a Crown case in reply. The trial judge acceded to an application by counsel for the appellant at the trial that, as no statement had been obtained from Mr Abbott, Mr Abbott should first give evidence in the absence of the jury.  
     
      
    39 Mr Abbott gave evidence, in the absence of the jury, that he had asked the appellant for written instructions and had received from her the statement of 17 May 2004. Mr Abbott denied that on any matter he had told the appellant what to say in her statement. 
     
      
    40 After Mr Abbott had given evidence in the absence of the jury, the Crown’s application to call Mr Abbott in a case in reply was argued. As it has not been suggested on this appeal that the trial judge made any error in permitting the Crown to call Mr Abbott in a case in reply, it is unnecessary to review the submissions made by counsel for the appellant at the trial, on the application by the Crown to call Mr Abbott. I will, however, observe that it would appear to me that his Honour’s decision was clearly correct. The Crown could not have reasonably anticipated, before the close of the Crown case and the appellant giving evidence in her own case, that the appellant would allege that assertions in her statement of 17 May 2004 had been made because Mr Abbott had told her to make the assertions. 
     
      
    41 During the argument on the Crown’s application to call Mr Abbott in a case in reply, the trial judge observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: …indeed as I’ve just pointed out, if the Crown wants to call the police to indicate their impression of the accused at the time of her arrest, I can’t see a reason to refuse that either, bearing in mind that none of the police were asked about the apparent state of affectation of the accused at the time of the arrest and now she says she was, to use her words, ‘stoned, smashed and on the nod’”. 
        
       
      
    42 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant at the trial that the prosecution ought reasonably to have foreseen, from the history of the matter and the part of the cross-examination of Mr Wormleaton I have referred to, that is the evidence of Wormleaton in cross-examination that the appellant had taken tablets and at times during the journey was “on the nod”, that the appellant might say that she was seriously intoxicated from drugs on the night of 31 August-1 September. The trial judge replied that Mr Wormleaton had not said, as the appellant herself had said in her evidence, that she was “smashed” or “stoned”. It was also submitted by counsel for the appellant at the trial that any evidence from the police would “not take the matter very far”. 
     
      
    43 The trial judge decided that he would permit the Crown to call a police officer in its case in reply. 
     
      
    44 In the case in reply Mr Abbott gave evidence similar to the evidence he had given in the absence of the jury, that he had asked the appellant to give him detailed written instructions but had not told her what to say on any matter. 
     
      
    45 Constable Pemberton, who had been in the same police vehicle as Constable Park, gave evidence about the police chase. After the chase had ended and the appellant had been taken out of the car in which she and Wormleaton had been travelling, Constable Pemberton supervised the appellant for approximately fifteen minutes, until other police vehicles arrived. Constable Pemberton said that he was familiar with the terms “smashed” and “stoned” and he had not formed a view that the appellant, while he was supervising her, was “smashed” or “stoned”. The appellant had initially sat in a gutter and had then asked whether she could sit on a nearby log fence. Her speech had been coherent and she had sat upright. 
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    46 The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal against conviction:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Crown prosecutor’s address which relied on lies told by the appellant as evidence of the appellant’s guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the learned trial judge to properly direct the jury in relation to lies alleged to have been told by the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The learned trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to call the evidence of Constable Pemberton in reply. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The learned sentencing judge erred when sentencing the appellant by taking into account the appellant’s prior convictions as an aggravating factor. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The learned sentencing judge erred when sentencing the appellant by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The learned sentencing judge erred when sentencing the appellant by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the victim was vulnerable. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon her and that imposed upon the co-offender, Wormleaton. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive”. 
        
       
      
    47 It is apparent that the first three grounds of appeal are grounds of appeal against conviction and the remaining grounds are grounds of appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    48 The first two grounds of appeal are related and were dealt with together in counsel’s written and oral submissions and it is convenient to deal with them together. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal against Conviction 1 and 2 
       
      
    49 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the telling of lies by the appellant had played a prominent part in the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
    50 It was submitted that the Crown had been in the unusual position of having in its possession previous out of court versions by the appellant of what had happened on the night of 31 August-1 September 2003 which the appellant had given to the solicitor or barrister then acting for her and at the trial the appellant had been cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor on inconsistencies between these versions and the evidence she had given in her evidence in chief. It had been put to the appellant by the Crown prosecutor at the trial that some things the appellant had said in her evidence in chief were lies and that her explanation of why she had made certain assertions in her statement of 17 May 2004, which were inconsistent with her evidence and which she now said were untrue, namely that she had been told to make the assertions by Mr Abbott, was itself a lie. 
     
      
    51 It was then submitted by counsel for the appellant that the Crown prosecutor in his closing address to the jury had sought to rely on the telling of lies by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    52 It was contended that any lies the appellant had told did not satisfy all of the conditions for a lie being capable of amounting to evidence of consciousness of guilt and the Crown prosecutor should not have sought to rely on the telling of lies by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Furthermore, the trial judge in his summing-up had not given the jury directions of the kind required when lies are relied on by the Crown as being evidence of consciousness of guilt Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. 
     
      
    53 Alternatively, the trial judge had not given the jury a direction of the kind suggested in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 245, to the effect that where lies are not relied on as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the jury should be directed that they should not reason that, just because the accused has been shown to have told a lie, that is evidence of his or her guilt. 
     
      
    54 It is clear that the trial judge in his summing-up did not give the jury any directions in accordance with Edwards or any directions in accordance with Zoneff. However, a critical question is whether, as was submitted by counsel for the appellant, the Crown prosecutor in his closing address to the jury did seek to rely on the telling of lies by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    55 Counsel for the appellant pointed to five passages in the Crown prosecutor’s closing address, which were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) I want to come briefly to the accused’s evidence. One thing that you can’t do in this trial is say look at Wormleaton, look at Hampstead on one side, put them on that side and then put the accused on this side and say which do I prefer, you cannot do it. It’s the Crown case that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and I as the Crown must prove it and I do that, I attempt to do that with my witnesses but having said that what you can do is this. You can look at Ms Rend because she went into the witness box and she faced cross-examination for an hour or so. You can look at her evidence and you assess it, she is a witness like every other witness when she goes into that witness box. You assess her evidence as you assess all the other witnesses, Hampstead, Wormleaton, … all of them. So look at her evidence and you form a view as to whether she was a witness of truth but even then, even if you don’t think she’s a witness of truth that still isn’t the end of it for you, you still can’t say well I’m satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, you still have to look back at the Crown evidence, always remember that, his Honour will tell you that and I think Mr Gilson will tell you that. But when you look at the Crown evidence you can take into account in your deliberations what the accused has said to you. You’ve heard this morning, you’ve heard the evidence this morning, you’ll remember the inconsistencies.” 
        
       
       
       ……. 
       
       
        
        “(2) Well gee isn’t that consistent with what’s in this document, the document that’s before you, exhibit S, isn’t that consistent with that but no Ms Rend wants to stay away from it, no, no that never happened, I only found out about this at the end because it’s important. It’s important for her defence that she only knew about it at the end, not at any time before. So she distanced herself from it”. 
        
       
       
       ….. 
       
       
        
        “(3) Well you saw and heard Ms Rend this morning and you saw her give her answers. Was she trying to tell the truth, was she a witness of truth, something you’ve got to take into account when you’re looking at the Crown case”. 
        
       
       
       …… 
       
       
        
        “(4) What does she say about that? ‘Mr Abbott told me to say it’, Mr Abbott, criminal solicitor of twenty years told her to tell lies, matter for yourself. Because you see you can understand, can’t you why Ms Rend would want to distance herself from the driving”. 
        
       
       
       ….. 
       
       
        
        “(5) But she drove, if you accept Hampstead. So if you accept that, she knew what was going on because she could drive, she was capable of driving, she was capable of agreeing to commit the crime of robbery. Why is she distancing herself from this driving, for that very reason because if she’s found to be the driver you might take the view that she’s part of the agreement”. 
        
       
      
    56 In my opinion, the first and third passages lend no support to counsel for the appellant’s submissions.  
     
      
    57 In the first passage the Crown prosecutor told the jury that the Crown bore the onus of proof, that the jury would have to assess the appellant’s evidence, that even if they did not think that the appellant was a truthful witness the jury would have to determine whether they accepted the Crown evidence but in determining whether they accepted the Crown evidence the jury could take into account inconsistencies in the appellant’s accounts of what had happened. 
     
      
    58 In the third passage the Crown prosecutor merely reminded the jury that, when determining whether the evidence adduced in the Crown case established the Crown case, they should consider whether the appellant in her evidence was a truthful witness. 
     
      
    59 In my opinion, the critical question to be determined is whether, in the second, fourth and fifth passages which I have quoted, the Crown prosecutor by submitting that the appellant in her evidence had “distanced herself” from knowing about the robbery at or about the time that it happened and had “distanced herself” from being the driver of the vehicle, because if she had been the driver of the vehicle that might show that she was a party to an agreement to rob Mr Hampstead, had sought to rely on the telling of lies by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    60 In determining this question I have taken into account the whole of the Crown prosecutor’s address. The conclusion I have reached is that, when the Crown prosecutor’s address is considered as a whole, the Crown prosecutor should not be regarded as having intended and would not have been understood by the jury as intending, to rely on the telling of lies by the appellant as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    61 A continually recurring theme in the Crown prosecutor’s address was that the jury should find that the appellant had no credibility and her evidence should be rejected. It seems to me that in submitting to the jury that the appellant had “distanced herself” from knowing about the robbery at or about the time it happened and from having been the driver of the vehicle, the Crown prosecutor was doing no more than submitting that her evidence on these matters should not be accepted and suggesting a reason for her having told an untruth, as increasing the likelihood that her evidence was indeed untrue. 
     
      
    62 The expression “distancing herself” was, perhaps, an expression which the Crown prosecutor would better have avoided. It was, however, an expression the Crown prosecutor used freely in the summing-up and not merely in relation to the appellant. For example, the Crown prosecutor said of some evidence given by Wormleaton which the Crown prosecutor submitted the jury should not accept, that Wormleaton in giving the evidence had “distanced himself” from the truth. 
     
      
    63 My view that the Crown prosecutor should not be regarded as having sought to rely on lies as consciousness of guilt is strengthened by the circumstance that it apparently did not occur to either counsel for the appellant at the trial or the trial judge that the Crown prosecutor was seeking to rely on lies as consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    64 The appellant was competently represented by her trial counsel. The appellant’s trial counsel made some, unrelated, applications to the trial judge for further directions after the trial judge had concluded the principal part of his summing-up but did not raise any objection to the Crown prosecutor’s address or make any application for a direction on lies. This Court received an affidavit from trial counsel in which counsel said that he had little recollection of the matter but had not made any conscious forensic decision not to apply for directions about lies. 
     
      
    65 In his summing-up the trial judge said nothing which could have suggested to the jury that it was part of the Crown case that the appellant had told lies in consciousness of guilt. In his summing-up the trial judge told the jury that the Crown relied on the appellant’s statement of 17 May 2004 only to a limited extent, that is only as containing an admission that she was the driver of the vehicle, which would confirm Mr Wormleaton’s evidence and Mr Hampstead’s evidence on that subject. 
     
      
    66 As the Crown prosecutor did not seek to rely on lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the trial judge was not required to give and, indeed, should not have given, directions in accordance with Edwards. 
     
      
    67 The trial judge did not give any Zoneff direction. However, none was asked for and it would appear that no one at the trial thought that a Zoneff direction was needed. 
     
      
    68 It is apparent from the joint judgment in the High Court in Zoneff that it is not mandatory to give a Zoneff direction in every case where it has been suggested that the accused has told lies. The joint judgment speaks of a direction “which might appropriately have been given”. It is a “direction which may well be adaptable” in cases where there is a risk of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies. 
     
      
    69 In R v Douglas [2005] NSWCCA 419 this Court referred with approval to what was said by Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545:- 
     
      
       
        
        ”In my view, even in cases where the lie is relied upon by the Crown only in relation to the credit of the accused, it is best for the judge to direct the jury that they should not find him guilty simply because he has told a lie, but it is not an error where that has not been done, and it is even less meritorious as an appeal point when the trial judge (as here) has not been requested to do so”. 
        
       
      
    70 I would reject the first and second grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal against Conviction 3 
       
      
    71 As I have stated earlier in this judgment, the Crown was permitted by the trial judge to call evidence in reply, including evidence from Constable Pemberton and it was the trial judge himself who suggested that the Crown might call evidence in reply from a police officer about whether the appellant at the time of her arrest appeared to be affected by drugs. 
     
      
    72 The principles that govern the exercise of the discretion of a trial judge to permit the Crown to call evidence in reply are well established. In The Queen v Chin (1984-1985) 157 CLR 671 Gibbs CJ and Wilson J said at 676:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles that govern the exercise of the discretion of a trial judge to call evidence after the close of the case for the defence have been discussed in this Court in  
        Shaw v The Queen 
         (1952) 85 CLR 365 at pp. 378-380, 383-384;  
        Killick v The Queen  
        (1981) 147 CLR 565 at pp. 568-571, 575-576 and  
        Lawrence v The Queen  
        (1981) 38 ALR 1 The general principle is that the prosecution must present its case completely before the accused is called upon for his defence. Although the trial judge has a discretion to allow the prosecution to call further evidence after evidence has been given for the defence, he should permit the prosecution to call evidence at that stage only if the circumstances are very special or exceptional and, generally speaking, not if the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen. The principle applies where the prosecution seeks to call evidence to rebut matters raised for the first time by the defence; if the rebutting evidence was itself relevant to prove the prosecution case (unless, perhaps, it was no more than marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant: … and if, the need to give it could have been foreseen it will, generally speaking, be rejected” 
        
       
      
    73 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the circumstances in the present trial were not “very special or exceptional” and that the occasion for calling Constable Pemberton’s evidence could reasonably have been foreseen. Counsel referred to the evidence given by Wormleaton in cross-examination in the Crown case, that the appellant had been taking tablets on 31 August and that during the journey in the vehicle she was at various times “on the nod”. Counsel referred particularly to annexures to the affidavit by Mr Walsh, which the Crown had had in its possession since the appellant’s application for leave to withdraw her pleas of guilty. Annexure B to the affidavit consisted of the notes made by Mr Walsh of a conference with the appellant on 24 May 2004, in which Mr Walsh had recorded that the appellant had told him that “I nodded off at times. Valium during the day, bong and 80ml methadone”. 
     
      
    74 Annexure C to the affidavit was a letter from Mr Walsh to his instructing solicitors in which Mr Walsh recorded that the appellant “continues to maintain that she was heavily affected by drugs during the whole of the day and evening”. 
     
      
    75 Annexure H to the affidavit was a report from Dr Carne, consultant forensic psychiatrist, in which Dr Carne recorded that “Ms Rend told me that she was a passenger in the car. She told me that at the time of offence she was affected by methadone, diazepam and marijuana”. 
     
      
    76 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that, although the Crown might have had notice that on 31 August 2003 the appellant had been taking drugs and the appellant might have been to some extent under the influence of drugs while in the vehicle, it could not reasonably have been foreseen that the appellant would claim that she was so far under the influence of drugs (“stoned” or “smashed”) as to have been asleep for most of the time in the vehicle and as to have been incapable of driving the vehicle. In the statement of 17 May which the appellant had given to Mr Abbott, which was also an annexure to Mr Walsh’s affidavit, the appellant had given a detailed account of events on the night of 31 August, which, the Crown submitted, would be inconsistent with her having been highly intoxicated or asleep, and had explicitly said that, although she took some pills in the vehicle and “things became a bit hazy”, she had kept driving. 
     
      
    77 It was also pointed out by the Crown that, when Constable Park had given evidence in the Crown case in chief, he had not been cross-examined about any observation he had made of the appellant’s state of sobriety or intoxication. 
     
      
    78 I have concluded that, consistently with the principles I have referred to, I should hold that the Crown should not have been permitted to call Constable Pemberton in a case in reply. It seems to me that it could reasonably have been foreseen by the Crown, before the close of the Crown case, that evidence about the appellant’s state of intoxication or sobriety might be relevant to such issues as whether the appellant had been asleep in the car, whether she had been driving the car and whether she had been a party to a joint enterprise with Wormleaton to rob Mr Hampstead. 
     
      
    79 With regard to a reason given by the trial judge and by the Crown on this appeal, for allowing the Crown to call a police officer in a case in reply, that Constable Park had not been asked in cross-examination about the appellant’s condition, the very existence of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, as applying to an accused in a criminal trial, has recently being seriously doubted by a majority of the High Court. MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74 at (41) per Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    80 I would uphold the third ground of appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    81 It does not, however, follow that the appeal against conviction should be allowed. I would apply the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act in favour of the Crown. Having made my own independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied that the evidence properly admitted at the trial proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellant’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty and that, apart from the admission of Constable Pemberton’s evidence in a case in reply, there was no breach of the fundamental conditions of a criminal trial. I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred. Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81 especially at pars 43-47.  
     
      
    82 The Crown case against the appellant, without the evidence of Constable Pemberton, that the appellant had been a party to an agreement with Wormleaton to rob Mr Hampstead, was overwhelming. The Crown case included the evidence of Wormleaton and Mr Hampstead. There was no suggestion at the trial that Mr Hampstead’s evidence was dishonest and Mr Hampstead’s evidence was strongly corroborated by his recorded emergency telephone call, made almost immediately after the robbery, in which he said that it was the female occupant of the car who had been driving the car. 
     
      
    83 The Crown case that the appellant had been driving the car was supported by the appellant’s repeated assertions in her statement of 17 May 2004 that she had been driving the car. This statement was a statement she had made in writing to the solicitor then acting for her. I would reject, as I am sure the jury rejected, the appellant’s explanation that she had been told by Mr Abbott what to say in her statement. 
     
      
    84 If the appellant was driving the vehicle immediately before and immediately after the robbery, then it was overwhelmingly likely that she had been a knowing participant in the robbery. 
     
      
    85 In the light of the inconsistencies in the appellant’s own versions of what had happened on 31 August-1 September, the appellant’s credibility as a witness was minimal. 
     
      
    86 I have held that Constable Pemberton’s evidence should not have been admitted. However his evidence was brief and, in my opinion, did not have the importance at the trial that counsel for the appellant on this appeal sought to attach to it. 
     
      
    87 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal against Sentence 
       
      
    88 The grounds of appeal against sentence can conveniently be dealt with together. 
     
      
    89 I have already reviewed the evidence in the trial about the offence committed by the appellant. In his remarks on sentence Judge Nield said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obvious, from its verdicts, that the jury accepted Mr Hampstead as a witness of truth and accepted his evidence, rejected the evidence of Wormleaton unless his evidence was supported by other evidence and rejected the evidence of the offender where it was in conflict with that of Mr Hampstead. Specifically, it is obvious that the jury accepted Wormleaton’s evidence that the offender knew that he intended to rob Mr Hampstead and accepted Mr Hampstead’s evidence that the driver of the vehicle when it went past him was female; that the driver of the motor vehicle slowed the speed of the vehicle as it approached and went past him; that Wormleaton, after he had robbed him, returned to the vehicle and entered it through the passenger’s side door of it; and that, thereupon, the driver of the vehicle drove it away”. 
        
       
      
    90 In his remarks on sentence his Honour made some findings about the subjective features of the appellant. She was born on 29 April 1980 and was, accordingly, twenty-four years old at the time of her being sentenced.  
     
      
    91 The appellant’s parents had separated when she was five or six years old. Both her father and the man who became her stepfather were violent men.  
     
      
    92 The appellant had been introduced to drugs when she was only eight or nine years old and she had been subjected to sexual abuse by a relative from the age of seven or eight to the age of twelve.  
     
      
    93 The appellant left school at the age of fourteen years, when pregnant with her first child, who was born in 1995. A second child was born in 1998. To support herself and her children she had resorted to prostitution.  
     
      
    94 The appellant had formed a relationship with Wormleaton, who during the relationship had used drugs and had physically abused her. 
     
      
    95 The appellant had a criminal history, consisting mainly of drug offences and driving offences. In 2001 she had been sentenced to imprisonment for two years, with a non-parole period of eight months, for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. She had two convictions for larceny, for one of which she had been imprisoned for six months. 
     
      
    96 In his remarks on sentence Judge Nield referred to the sentences passed on Wormleaton. Wormleaton received a total discount of 50 per cent for his pleas of guilty and for the assistance he had provided and had undertaken to provide in the prosecution of the appellant. The sentences imposed on Wormleaton were a total sentence of two years six months with a non-parole period of one year six months for the offence of armed robbery and, for the other two offences, fixed terms of imprisonment of one year to be served concurrently with part of the non-parole period of the sentence for armed robbery. 
     
      
    97 Judge Nield said in his remarks on sentence that because Wormleaton was sentenced for the more serious offence of armed robbery and because he had received a discount for his pleas of guilty and his assistance, “the principle of parity of sentencing does not apply”. 
     
      
    98 In his remarks on sentence Judge Nield referred to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and held that the aggravating factors in par (d) (the offender has a record of previous convictions), par (e) (the offence was committed in company) and par (l) (the victim was vulnerable) were present. 
     
      
    99 I will now turn to the grounds of appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 4 
       
      
    100 Counsel for the appellant referred to what has been said by this Court in such cases as R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76 and R v Blair (2005) 152 A Crim R 462, to the effect that under subs (5) of s 21A a court is not to have regard to an aggravating factor in sentencing, if it would be contrary to any rule of law to do so and it is a common law principle that prior convictions do not operate to aggravate an offence but may deprive an offender of leniency or indicate that it is more appropriate to give more weight to some of the purposes of sentencing. 
     
      
    101 In any event, however any permissible use of an offender’s previous criminal history so as to increase a sentence should be characterised, I would not consider that the appellant’s two previous offences of larceny constituted a criminal record such that the sentencing judge was entitled, on that account, to increase the sentence he would impose on the appellant. 
     
      
    102 I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 5 
       
      
    103 The sentencing judge was not entitled to take into account as an aggravating factor that the offence had been committed in company. The appellant had been convicted of an offence under s 94 of the Crimes Act of robbery simpliciter and had not been convicted of the aggravated offence of robbery in company under s 97 of the Crimes Act, which carries a higher maximum penalty. To take into account as an aggravating factor that the offence had been committed in company involved a clear breach of R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 and also of s 21A(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    104 I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    105 I will next consider Ground 7. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 7 
       
      
    106 As I have already indicated, his Honour considered that because Wormleaton had been convicted of a more serious offence and had received a discount for his pleas of guilty and assistance, the principle of parity in sentencing did not apply. However, notwithstanding these differences between the appellant and the co-offender Wormleaton, I consider that it was still necessary for the sentencing judge to impose a sentence on the appellant such that there would be a due proportion between the sentence passed on the appellant and the sentence or sentences passed on Wormleaton Postiglione v The Queen (1995-1996) 189 CLR 295 at 301-302 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. The principle of due proportionality in sentencing co-offenders was applied in Postiglione, notwithstanding a number of differences between Postiglione and the co-offender Savvas. 
     
      
    107 The judge who sentenced Wormleaton quantified a combined discount for Wormleaton’s pleas of guilty and assistance as 50 per cent, so that the sentence which would have been imposed on Wormleaton for the offence of armed robbery, absent the plea of guilty and the assistance, would have been five years.  
     
      
    108 I accept the submission by counsel for the appellant that the sentence imposed on the appellant of four years was unduly severe, when compared with a sentence of five years, which would have been imposed on Wormleaton but for his pleas of guilty and assistance. Wormleaton was sentenced for a more serious offence of armed robbery, whereas the appellant was sentenced for the less serious offence of robbery simpliciter. It is clear that Wormleaton took the leading role in the planning of the offence for which the appellant was sentenced, the preparation for the offence and the actual carrying out of the offence. At the time of committing the offence of armed robbery, Wormleaton was on bail and subject to a bond. The sentence imposed on Wormleaton was partly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the other offences committed by Wormleaton.  
     
      
    109 As, in my opinion, the challenge to the appellant’s sentence based on Postiglione v The Queen has been made good, it is unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal against sentence. I would grant leave to the appellant to appeal against sentence and I would allow the appeal against sentence. It is accordingly necessary for this Court to re-sentence the appellant. 
     
      
    110 I have already referred to the objective facts of the offence and to the subjective features of the appellant and to the sentences passed on the co-offender Wormleaton. I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I would find special circumstances in the circumstances found by the sentencing judge, namely her need for appropriate treatment and counselling to prevent another relapse into the use of prohibited drugs, and I would maintain the same ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence. 
     
      
    111 In my opinion, the appellant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of one year six months with a balance of the term of the sentence of one year six months, making a total sentence of three years.  
     
      
    112 The orders I consider should be made are:- 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
       
      4. Sentence imposed on 7 April 2005 for the offence of robbery quashed. In lieu thereof the appellant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of one year six months with a balance of term of one year six months making a total sentence of three years to date from 25 January 2005. 
       
       
      5. Direct that the appellant be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period on 24 July 2006. 
       
       
      6. Confirm the sentence on the related charge of driving while disqualified and the order for disqualification.

     Leigh Paul PERRIN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     Judgment 
      
    1. McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Smart AJ2. ROTHMAN J: I agree with Smart AJ.3. SMART AJ:  Leigh Paul Perrin seeks leave to appeal, against a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 19 May 2005 and a parole period of 2 years commencing on 19 May 2009 for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, taking into account the offence of aggravated indecent assault. The maximum penalty for the principal offence is 14 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 7 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence taken into account is 7 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 5 years imprisonment. The offences were alleged to have occurred about 4 May 2003.4. On 5 December 2003 the applicant and four other men were each arraigned on three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. A co-accused was also arraigned on a charge of supplying amphetamine.5. In October 2004 there were preliminary proceedings before the trial judge to determine the admissibility of certain materials into evidence and to allow certain Crown witnesses to be examined. On 27 October 2004 the judge ruled, amongst other things, that the record of interview of the applicant was admissible. That led to negotiations between the legal representatives of the Crown and the applicant. On 28 October 2004 a fresh indictment was presented against the applicant only, containing a single count of sexual intercourse without consent. Significantly, the feature of aggravation had been dropped. This meant that the applicant was no longer being charged with committing the offence in company. To this charge the applicant pleaded guilty. He also asked the judge to take into account one count of aggravated indecent assault on a Form One. The count of sexual intercourse involved penile/vaginal intercourse for a relatively brief period. The aggravated indecent assault involved the applicant putting his penis in the face of the complainant without her consent whilst in the company of another.6. After the applicant’s plea was entered his counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the factual basis on which … this offender will be sentenced are those that can be gleaned in the ERISP interview with Detective Craft.” 
         
        
       
      
    7. The applicant’s matter was adjourned. Two of his co-offenders, Robert Shepherd and Scott South went to trial. On 1 December 2004 the jury returned verdicts of guilty of aggravated indecent assault against Shepherd and South. Shepherd was also found guilty of aggravated indecent assault. The other two did not stand trial as the complainant did not feel able to go through, again, the ordeal of giving evidence.8. On 5 May 2005 the sentence proceedings of the applicant and his co-offenders commenced with the Crown tendering the following material against the applicant: Agreed Facts Copy Indictment The Form One 
     
      
       The Criminal Antecedents of the applicant to indicate that he was not known 
      
     The applicant’s recorded interview by the police The Crown also tendered the Pre-Sentence Report of 9 February 2005. The material was admitted without objection. The victim impact statement was admitted against all three offenders. It did not contain an account of the offence. The Agreed Facts read: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour, the Agreed Facts are based on admissions made by the Offender in an ERISP conducted at Campbelltown Police Station on Thursday 29 May 2003. 
         It is proposed that the Crown and Counsel for the Offender will make separate submissions as to what your Honour should find as the conduct surrounding the offences. 
         Sexual Intercourse Without Consent 
         At some point during the period the Victim was in the bedroom, the Offender engaged in sexual intercourse without consent. The subject of his intercourse was referred to inter alia at page 55 of the Offender’s ERISP. He was asked ‘how many times did you put it in? ’and answered ‘I was there for about twenty to thirty seconds, I think, then she turned around and said ‘no no no.’ Then I was just standing in the room because she said ‘no’ because of Romaine.’ That answer (A167) goes on ‘I said “oh don’t worry, don’t worry about Romaine” and she goes ‘no no I can’t do it’ so I thought ‘all right, no worries’. And then she said ‘no so I stopped.” 
         Aggravated Indecent Assault (Form 1) 
         In respect of the second count, despite [the complainant] making it plain that she did not wish to engage in sexual activity with him, at a later point in the night, when he says [the complainant] was alone with Scott, he again attempted to convince her that she should engage in sexual activity with him. As disclosed in his admissions, he went so far as to expose his penis to her, and place it in the vicinity of her face, whilst she continued to indicate that she did not wish sexual activity with him.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9. The judge’s remarks on sentence in which he described what had occurred in general terms did not adequately distinguish between the Crown case against Shepherd and South and that against the applicant. The latter was limited to the material tendered against him. The judge in setting out the facts relied on the evidence which had been adduced at the trial of South and Shepherd. That had not been tendered against the applicant.10. The Court was assured by counsel, and its own reading of the material confirmed, that the applicant’s record of interview did not contain many of the facts set out in the judge’s remarks on sentence. The applicant’s record of interview extends over 100 pages, is repetitive and somewhat difficult to follow. After the introduction and formal parts of the interview had been completed Det Craft asked the applicant to tell him all he could about the sexual assault of the complainant in the early hours of Monday, 4 May 2003 at 33 Denison Street, Ruse, and to give him as much detail as he could. (It should have been Monday 5 May 2003. The “drinks” started late on the previous evening). After the applicant had given his uninterrupted account extending over about 8½ pages, Det Craft took the applicant “back to the beginning just to clarify some points.” 11. In his narration of the facts the judge summarised the account given by the complainant in her evidence. She attributed a bigger and somewhat different role to the applicant than emerged from his ERISP.12. In the ERISP the applicant said: 
     
      
       Sexual Intercourse Without Consent 
       (a) At pp 11-12: 
       
        
         
          
           
           “… one of the guys … was helping her take her pants off, then I tried to have sex with her but as I, as I got, like, sort of started havin’ sex with her, she turned around and said, ‘No, because of my ex, she was friends with my ex girl friend. So I … got off her and then, like, we were all stuffin’, muckin’ around … in the bedroom and that.” 
           
          
          
         (b) At p 54, he was the first person to have sex with the complainant. 
          
          
         (c) At p 55 
          
          
           
           ”Q.166: … how many times did you put it in? 
            
            A. Probably, oh, I was, I was there for about 20 to 30 seconds, I think. 
            
            
            Q.167: OK 
           
           A. --- then she’s turned around and said, No, no, no. And I was just standing in the room, because she said, ‘No’ because of Romaine, rah, rah, rah, and I thought oh, and then, like, I said Oh, don’t worry like, Don’t worry about Romaine, and she goes, No, no, I can’t do it, so I said All right. I was just tryin’ to convince her, she said, No, so I thought, all right, no worries. And then she’s like, said, No, so I stopped …”  
           
          
         
        
       
      
    13. Romaine was the ex girlfriend of the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
         
         (d) At p55, the complainant became involved with Scott South. 
         
        
       
      
     Aggravated Indecent Assault 
     
      
      (a) At p56-57 in answer to Q 170, the applicant continued that when the complainant and Scott were out the back of the house 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “I tried to get her to give, I was seein’ if she’d give me head. She said, No, like she put her lips up … against my dick and then she sort of just went, No, and then we, I went, All right, I’m going inside, so I got up and walked inside.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (b) At pp92-93 in answer to Q 302, the applicant gave substantially the same version of events, but added that he pulled his pants down but she ultimately declined. 
      
    14. Various other allegations of sexual misconduct were put to the applicant, but they were denied by him. While the applicant’s ERISP reveals much unsavoury conduct on the part of those present at the house the applicant, in substance, denied any knowledge of any sexual assaults apart from the two offences admitted by virtue of the agreed facts. He said that the two acts which he committed took place in the context of the complainant having apparently consensual sex with other men.15. The applicant did not give evidence before the judge.16. The applicant told the Probation and Parole Officer that at the time of the offence he was intoxicated, having consumed alcohol, that in the days leading up to the offence he had been using illicit substances and that he believed he was under the effect of those substances at the time of the offence. The Pre-Sentence Report contains this paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         “Mr Perrin stated that prior to the offence he had believed the victim wanted to have sexual intercourse with him. He said that during sexual intercourse the victim did say to him, ‘stop’, however he did not, until she again said ‘stop’ approximately four seconds later when another person entered the room. Mr Perrin informed me that this was the first and only instance of him participating in sexual intercourse in the company of others.” 
        
       
      
    17. The report also comments that Mr Perrin’s interpretation of the offence and the events of the evening of 4 May 2003 appeared to differ from those described in the victim’s statement.18. During the sentence hearing on 6 May 2005 counsel for the applicant reiterated that his client’s plea was based on the matters disclosed in his record of interview and that “the trial evidence was not part of these proceedings against Mr Perrin.” The Crown prosecutor stated “Certainly the Crown says that the pleas were accepted based on the admissions contained in the record of interview of Mr Perrin”. The judge stated (T27 of 6/5/05): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “I don’t think I could find anything adverse to your client [Perrin] if it’s material that arose out of the trial. I don’t think that would be fair and appropriate.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     and 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “… I won’t be taking into account anything adverse to Mr Perrin that might have occurred during the course of the trial but which isn’t part of this material because of the simple reason that he hasn’t had an opportunity to challenge it in any way.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19. During the sentencing hearing the applicant’s counsel stated: 
     
      
       
        
         “I don’t … suggest that every word uttered in the record of interview should be taken as being the uncontested truth … there are not only inferences that can be drawn to his detriment but there is also a broad concession by him, again by inference that he was present at least in or around the house throughout the course of the evening.” 
        
       
      
    20. The Crown acknowledged before the judge that parts of the record of interview were in stark contrast to the evidence. The Crown drew the judge’s attention to the applicant being in the house for the entirety of the evening and being aware of what was happening, yet not coming to the complainant’s assistance.21. The applicant was born on 19 January 1985 and was thus 18 years of age when he committed the offences. He had no prior convictions and there was a body of evidentiary material that he was a person of prior good character. The Pre-Sentence Report stated that enquiries revealed that the applicant was a caring, trustworthy, honest and reliable person in the eyes of his family, his partner’s family and friends. He has a supportive family and his partner’s family is also supportive.22. He completed the School Certificate but did not enjoy school or flourish in the school environment. He completed the TAFE component of his apprenticeship as a butcher, but he is yet to complete sufficient work hours to be entitled to receive his trade certificate. He prefers other work and has held a variety of other positions. He has been keen to work and has been in constant employment. He lost one part time position as a result of adverse publicity arising from the events of 4-5 May 2003.23. The Crown’s position was that his plea of guilty, which came after the conclusion of the voir dire entitled him to a discount of about 15 per cent. The judge accepted that the applicant pleaded guilty at an early point in time but the judge did not regard the plea as being entered at the earliest point of time. The judge did not quantify the discount which he allowed but from his comments it would be less than 25 per cent. The course taken was not erroneous.24. The judge found special circumstances principally to ensure a longer period on parole so as to provide adequate supervision and assistance in the applicant’s rehabilitation and re-integration back into the community. This was the first time in custody for the applicant. 
     
      
      Appeal Ground 1 reads 
       
        
        “His Honour erred in sentencing the applicant on a factual basis not supported by the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    25. Whatever may have been the judge’s stated intention on 6 May 2005, it does appear from the sentencing remarks that he did proceed on the basis of the evidence adduced at the trial, mainly that of the complainant and did not confine himself in the case of the applicant to the agreed facts and those admitted by him in his ERISP. There were significant factual differences as to the role and criminal conduct of the applicant which emerged at the trial and those admitted by him in his ERISP.26. The Crown, correctly, specifically did not attempt to submit that the facts as to the offences narrated in the judge’s remarks or most of them could be found in the ERISP.27. The Crown primarily relied upon the submission that the judge was well seized of the requirement to sentence the applicant only on the basis of the limited evidence tendered against him in the sentence proceedings. Unfortunately, in his remarks on sentence the judge did not do so. It is to those remarks that this Court must look. Those remarks cannot be qualified by earlier statements of intention as to what was intended to be done. This Court is always wary of attaching importance to remarks made by judges during discussions during sentence hearings. During those discussions ideas and tentative views are sometimes raised and then not maintained. Part of the purpose of the discussions is to correct misconceptions and errors. Of course, if the judge gives what amounts to a ruling or direction, or states that particular evidence is rejected or not required, the position may differ especially if it bears upon the course which the proceedings took.28. In his remarks the judge summarised the effect of the three records of interview including the admissions made by Mr Perrin. That does not overcome the judge’s approach as earlier outlined.29. Counsel for the applicant correctly pointed out that, if authority were needed, this Court has held that it is an error for a sentencing judge to sentence an offender on the basis of material not in evidence against that offender, but which emerges in the trial of a co-offender. R v H [2005] NSWCCA 282, esp at [67] to [69]30. The effect of what the judge did was to elevate the proved criminality of the applicant.31. Appeal Ground 1 has been established.32. Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in treating as aggravating factors: 
        (a) the fact that she was vulnerable because of her age, which was 18 at the time of the offence and 
        (b) the fact that what occurred was a series of criminal acts.” 
        
       
      
    33. In his remarks the judge said (12-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have no doubt that the injury and emotional harm caused by the offence was substantial to this victim. I am also satisfied that the victim was vulnerable. She was eighteen at the time. She was clearly affected by drugs and/or alcohol and yet despite her age and despite the obvious effect of what she had consumed, she was taken advantage of. I am also satisfied that in regard to the offending, whilst each offender has been charged with specific offences, what occurred was a series of criminal acts against her.” 
        
       
      
    34. Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Aggravating factors 
         
        The aggravating factors to be taken into account … are as follows: 
         
         … 
         
        (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant); 
         
         
        (m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts.” 
         
        
       
      
    35. The test is that the victim was vulnerable. Some examples are then given but they are not exhaustive. The judge relies on two factors to establish that she was vulnerable, namely, her age of 18 and her being affected by drugs and/or alcohol. I do not regard the age of 18 as being very young. That is the age of adulthood. However, she was vulnerable as a result of what she had drunk. That lowered markedly what she could appreciate and what she could do.36. The applicant’s offence did not involve a series of criminal acts. He made no admissions that he encouraged or was aware of criminal acts being committed by others. Nor is there material from which such an inference could be drawn.37. Appeal Ground 3 reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
     38. The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the count on the indictment was not as suggested by the applicant, “close to the very bottom of the range for such offences.” There was full penetrative penile/vaginal intercourse when the complainant was not consenting and made her lack of consent clear to the applicant. The Crown also submitted that the Form 1 offence was well above the bottom of the range for such an offence. It pointed out that it was necessary to reflect the Form 1 offence in the sentence for the count on the indictment as explained in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518.39. The Crown submitted that the term of the sentence (6 years) was within the permissible range having regard to: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “a. the objective seriousness of the offence on the indictment; 
          b. the available statutory maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for fourteen (14) years; 
          c. the requirement to discount the term of the sentence by reason of the early plea of guilty; 
          d. the standard minimum non-parole period of seven (7) years provided by section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; 
          e. the requirement that the sentence be duly incremented to reflect that the offence on the Form 1 document had been taken into account; and, 
          f. the relevant subjective features of the Applicant including age and the absence of prior criminal history.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    40. The Crown further submitted that the non-parole period of 4 years was also within the permissible range having regard to the finding of special circumstances including: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “a. the age of the Applicant; 
          b. the need for an extended period on parole to facilitate rehabilitation; and, 
          c. that the present will be the first custodial sentence served by the Applicant.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    41. Once the factual basis set out in the judge’s remarks for sentencing the applicant is found to be erroneous and the Court is confined to the material admitted against him, the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive as to the full term and the non-parole period.42. Both the offence on the indictment and that in the Form 1 are matters of considerable gravity. Significant punishment is warranted and necessary.43. A view has earlier been expressed as to the aggravating features. The mitigating features have been taken into account.44. As the Court is re-sentencing the applicant, regard should be had to the affidavit sworn by the solicitor for the applicant and that sworn by the solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions having the conduct of this matter. Upon his reception into custody the applicant applied to be taken into protective custody and his application was approved. He remains in protective custody. He has enrolled in a number of programmes and has been working while in custody. The following details of his conditions of custody have been supplied: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the applicant is held at Long Bay Gaol with a C1 classification in a Special Management Area Placement (SMAP), due to the nature of his offence; 
        (b) there are 60-80 other inmates in the area in which he is held and all of the inmates in the area are SMAP inmates; 
        (c) he has access to other inmates, the opportunity to work in the wing and access to rehabilitation programmes such as education, drug and alcohol counselling and psychological services; and 
        
       
      
     (d) children are not permitted to visit the applicant in custody. The applicant has taken advantage of the programmes and work available. They will help his rehabilitation. The applicant’s conditions of custody are not such as to warrant a further discount.45. There are special circumstances. These include the applicant’s youth, this is his first time in custody and the extended period of supervision required. The full term of the sentence should be 4 years and the non-parole period should be 2 years.46. I propose the following orders: 1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 2. Appeal allowed; sentence quashed. 
     
      
       
        
         3. In lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant is sentenced, taking into account the offence of aggravated indecent assault, as follows: 
         
         
          
          (a) Set a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 19 May 2005 and expiring on 18 May 2007 on which day the applicant will be eligible for release to parole; and 
           
           
          (b) to a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 19 M 
          ay 
           2007 and expiring on 18 May 2009. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         4. The applicant is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and comply with all the reasonable directions of that Service.

     REESE, David Robert v R 
     
     
     Judgment 
    1 SULLY J: The court is in a position to express a view about this application. Justice Simpson will deliver the first judgment.2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 29 April 2005, following his plea of guilty to an offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal and commit a serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence was assault occasioning actual bodily harm; the circumstance of special aggravation was wounding. The offence was committed on 23 September 2004.3 Pursuant to s112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 the offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty-five years. By s54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a standard non-parole period of seven years is prescribed. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years made up of a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two and a half years. In imposing that sentence the sentencing judge, Delaney DCJ, held that the offence was below the mid range of objective seriousness of sentences of that kind. It was, nonetheless, a serious offence.4 It was committed about 3.15am at the home of an acquaintance of the applicant. The victim was watching television. The applicant made two attempts to gain entry by removing flyscreens at the front and the rear of the premises, before forcing the lock of a window and then smashing the glass and entering the unit.5 He attacked the victim, initially, it seems, without a weapon, but subsequently armed himself with an industrial broom that belonged to the victim. He used this to strike the victim around the head and body. He broke the broom handle and continued to use the broom shaft to attack the victim.6 The victim in fact described this part of the attack as the applicant raising the broom handle above his head, pushing the handle towards the victim with a great deal of force and, with the end of the broom handle, stabbing the victim in the top left hand of his head. It was the splintered end of the broom handle that caused a wound to the victim’s head, which subsequently required four stitches.7 The victim fled and was followed by the applicant who pushed the victim through a flyscreen door, damaging the door. In the process the victim ran to a nearby service station where he contacted the police. The applicant was arrested soon after and has remained in custody ever since. 
     
      
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    8 The sentencing judge had the benefit of a pre-sentence report. This disclosed the applicant’s subjective case. He was born on 30 September 1953 and was a week short of forty-one years of age when he committed the offence. He had some record, including offences of break, enter and steal, although these were committed as a juvenile and were dealt with in the Children’s Court in 1979; they can safely be disregarded.9 There are two offences of assault, one in 1985 and one in 1999. There are some drug offences and there are the most recent serious offences which include possession of housebreaking implements, enter building or land with intent to commit an indictable offence and goods in custody. For these he was dealt with in September 2003 and on each of those a bond was imposed. All told, and notwithstanding those last offences, the applicant’s record is relatively minor, although not such as to be entirely disregarded. 10 The applicant came from a dysfunctional family. He is the eldest of three children. His mother was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, following which she refused treatment. Thereafter the applicant and his siblings were placed in the custody of his father.11 His education was very limited. His literacy skills were described as being at survival level only. He has had some employment, but not in the last eight years. He lost his last employment as a result of accelerating drug use. He used cannabis and became addicted to amphetamines. He had used amphetamines and consumed some alcohol on the evening of the offence. At the time of the offence he was homeless, living under a bridge not far from the victim’s home.  
     
      
      Remarks on Sentence 
      
    12 As indicated, Delaney DCJ held that the offence was below the mid range of objective seriousness. In effect, putting the findings so neutrally somewhat understates what his Honour said, which was that while there was no dispute that this was a serious offence in terms of the count under s112(3) of the Crimes Act, the offence could not be regarded in any way other than below the mid range of objective seriousness. For my part I regard this as a rather generous finding in relation to the applicant when considering the ferocity of the attack on the victim. 13 Delaney DCJ recited the objective facts and also the subjective matters that had been placed before him. He made reference on more than one occasion to the applicant’s criminal record. On one occasion, having referred to the record, he said “however, it does nothing to aggravate the offence”, and made a reference to Veen (No 2) v The Queen [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465. 14 He then noted that the applicant was on a bond at the time of the offence and turned a little later again to the applicant’s criminal record. He did this specifically in the context of referring to aggravating factors. Again it is convenient to quote what he said. He referred, as an aggravating feature, to the fact that the applicant was on a bond, and then he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “… he had previous convictions for a similar offence. However, the court is to keep in mind  
        Veen (No 2) v The Queen 
         on this issue.” 
        
       
      
    15 He then referred to the use of the weapon. He noted that the offence was induced by alcohol and drugs and said that he would depart from the standard non-parole period because, among other reasons, of the plea of guilty which he held warranted a reduction in sentence of twenty per cent. The pre-sentence report also included the suggestion that the offence had been committed by way of debt recovery, the applicant believing that the victim owed him money which he refused to pay. His Honour appears to have accepted this as a fact although no direct evidence of it was put before him. His Honour also found that the applicant had expressed remorse for the offence and for the effect on the victim. 
     
      
      The application for leave to appeal 
      
    16 Two grounds were advanced. The first is that the sentencing judge erred in treating the applicant’s criminal record as an aggravating factor. The second is that the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances.17 The first of these, I think, can be dealt with quickly. The reference to the applicant’s criminal record is said to contain an error in the assertion that the applicant had previous convictions for a similar offence. The previous offences were not strictly of the same kind, but there certainly were relevant previous convictions. In any event, that reference was followed immediately by the words I have previously extracted:  
     
      
       
        
        “… however, the court is to keep in mind  
        Veen (No 2) v The Queen 
         on this issue.” 
        
       
      
    18 I do not think his Honour can be taken to have (impermissibly) regarded the previous conviction as an aggravating feature.19 The second ground is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In my opinion this cannot be accepted. The offence itself was extremely serious, even though his Honour concluded that it was below the mid range of objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour was required to bear in mind the seven year standard non-parole period prescribed by s54A of the Sentencing Procedure Act as a guidepost or benchmark.20 It was submitted that when the twenty per cent discount for the plea of guilty is factored in, the starting point for the head sentence was almost seven years. That may be so, but it does not strike me in the circumstances as being manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.21 SULLY J: I entirely agree.22 HOWIE J: I also agree.23 SULLY J: The order of the court will be as proposed by Simpson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of Howie J in draft. But for my comments below I agree with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 Howie J expresses the view that the principles relevant to the admission and use which can be made of context and tendency evidence are uncontroversial. Having regard to the discussion between the members of the High Court in Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106, which were identified but properly put aside by this Court in R v Fraser (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 August 1998), I respectfully doubt whether this area of the law can be so described. Furthermore, the problems experienced by trial judges in correctly identifying whether evidence is context evidence or evidence of a tendency in the accused and giving the appropriate directions, which are apparent from matters argued in this Court, suggests there may be difficulties in both understanding and applying the presently accepted principles. As Howie J points out these difficulties can be compounded if care is not taken to adequately assess whether the evidence should be admitted having regard to s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    3 I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J.4 HOWIE J: The appellant appeared in the District Court on 23 August 2004 to stand trial on an indictment containing 15 counts of child sexual assault offences. Ten of those counts related to AM, a 13 year old female, and five related to MW, a 14 year old male. The Crown sought to run a joint trial of all the counts in the indictment notwithstanding that, shortly after making his complaints to police by way of a video-recorded interview, MW committed suicide. 
     
      
    5 The trial judge, Shadbolt DCJ (“the Judge”), granted an application for separate trials in relation to the allegations relating to AM. His Honour held that it would be unfairly prejudicial for the evidence of sexual assaults allegedly committed by the appellant upon MW to be placed before the jury especially in light of the inability of the defence to cross-examine him. An indictment was then presented containing the ten counts relating to AM. The Crown indicated it intended to play portions of MW’s video-recorded interview on the trial of the charges relating to AM. There was an objection taken by counsel appearing for the appellant but the Judge stated that he had already ruled in favour of the Crown tendering the evidence during the course of determining the separate trial application and confirmed that he would allow the evidence. 
     
      
    6 An edited copy of the video-recorded interview given by MW was played to the jury. It contained allegations made by MW of sexual acts committed by the appellant against AM which were not the subject of the charges on the indictment, complaint by AM to MW about the appellant’s sexual activity with her and an admission allegedly made to MW by the appellant of a sexual act committed by him against AM. 
     
      
    7 Following the opening addresses, the Judge allowed the Crown to amend the indictment to include an additional count that was numbered as “6” and replaced the original count with that number on the indictment upon which the appellant had been arraigned at the outset of the trial. However, the count that had been originally numbered “6” remained on the indictment but was unnumbered and was expressed to be in the alternative to the new 6th count. The appellant was then re-arraigned on the amended indictment. Seven of the counts on that indictment were in respect of offences of aggravated sexual intercourse contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act, three were in respect of offences of aggravated acts of indecency contrary to s 61O(1) of that Act and one was in respect of an offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61O(1) of that Act. Each count referred to the complainant as being between the ages of 10 years and 16 years. The individual counts related to various time frames, however in their entirety they related to the period 1 February 2002 to 9 August 2002. 
     
      
    8 The jury convicted the appellant of each of the numbered counts on the indictment and no verdict was taken in respect of the alternative unnumbered count. 
     
      
    9 The appellant initially appealed against conviction upon four grounds, but abandoned ground 4 at the commencement of the hearing. However the appellant sought leave at the hearing to add two further grounds of appeal. There was no opposition from the Crown and leave was granted. The new grounds became grounds 5 and 6. These two grounds were not argued orally but the Court received written submissions relating to those grounds after it had reserved its decision on the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    10 The grounds of appeal ultimately relied upon by the appellant are as follows: 
     
      
    1. His Honour erred by admitting into evidence the video taped interview between MW and Senior Constable Alison Forbes dated 9 September 2002. 
     
      
    2. His Honour erred by admitting into evidence the portions of the video taped interview between AM and Senior Constable Alison Forbes dated 4 September 2002 wherein AM suggested that the accused had engaged in improper acts with MW and Kristen Andrews; 
     
      
    3. His Honour erred by failing to direct the jury that MW’s evidence relating to uncharged sexual acts was to be used as evidence of the relationship that existed between the appellant and the complainant and could not be used for any other purposes; 
     
      
    4. (abandoned); 
     
      
    5. The trial miscarried because of the failure to deal properly with the complainant’s evidence. Particulars: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The video recordings were admitted into evidence as exhibits. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The videotapes were sent to the jury room. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The transcripts of the tapes were not withdrawn from the jury after first being played. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) The jury were not given a warning pursuant to section 14 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1987 that they should not draw any inference adverse to the appellant or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the evidence being given by video recording. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) The jury were not warned that, if they played the tapes in the jury room they should do so with caution because they would be seeing and hearing evidence of a witness for a second time well after all the evidence and that they should guard against giving it disproportionate weight and they should bear well in mind the other evidence in the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) The jury were not given a warning pursuant to section 25 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1987 that it is standard procedure for children’s evidence to be given by means of closed circuit television; that they should not draw any inference adverse to the appellant because of the use of this technology and that they should not give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because it was given by this means. 
        
       
      
    6. His Honour erred by failing to warn the jury in relation to MW’s evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) that they should not draw any inference adverse to the appellant or give the evidence any greater weight because the evidence was given in video form; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that, if they played the tape in the jury room they should do so with caution because they would be seeing and hearing evidence of a witness for a second time and well after all the evidence and they should guard against giving it disproportionate weight and should bear well in mind the other evidence in the case. 
        
       
      
    11 It is unnecessary to set out the Crown case in any great detail because of the nature of the grounds of appeal relied upon. What follows is a brief summary to place the grounds of appeal in context. The appellant was the owner and director of a theatrical business that operated in Mr Druitt called Starburst Entertainment (“Starburst”). The appellant offered lessons to children in drama, singing and dancing and also staged theatrical productions in which children were involved. The appellant resided in the premises from which Starburst operated in a self-contained flat below the performance hall. The allegations that gave rise to the charges were that the appellant had, on occasions when the complainant attended the premises for lessons or rehearsals or productions, sexually assaulted her in his flat. 
     
      
    12 MW was a male friend of the complainant and slightly older than she. The complainant was born on 27 April 1988 and MW on 18 July 1988. He also participated in productions put on by Starburst. He told police that AM was his “best friend” and that he, AM and the appellant were “really good mates”. The complainant told police that she, MW and the appellant had been “close friends”. 
     
      
    13 It was the Crown case that the sexual relationship between the appellant and the complainant commenced with an act of indecency sometime between February and April 2002 that involved the appellant kissing both AM and MW simultaneously. The incident can be referred to as “the three way kiss” and gave rise to the first count on the indictment. The Crown alleged that the sexual relationship between AM and the appellant progressed through digital penetration of the complainant, cunnilingus, fellatio, and ultimately penile penetration of the complainant’s vagina. Evidence was given by a former teacher at Starburst, Ms Andrews, that on 1 September 2002 the complainant told her that the appellant “had sex and he’s taken me all the way”. Ms Andrews urges the complainant to tell her parents and she did later that day. 
     
      
    14 Police video-recorded an interview with the complainant on 4 September 2002 and again on 6 September 2002. MW was interviewed twice on 9 September 2002. He committed suicide on 13 October 2002. 
     
      
    15 The Crown case was that the complainant’s evidence was supported by the fact that a large number of text messages and telephone calls had been sent from the appellant’s mobile phone and home landline phone to the complainant. Records revealed that for the periods 1 March to 31 May 2002 and 1 August to 30 September 2002 there were 279 text messages or calls from the appellant to AM. Some of these calls were placed in the late evening or early morning hours. A text message received by the complainant from the appellant on 2 September 2002 at 2.20am stated, “Hey, if I can’t hug and kiss you for real then I’ll do it here, kiss, hug, kiss, hug”. 
     
      
    16 The appellant gave evidence and denied a sexual relationship with the complainant. He stated that he was “gay” and had never had any sexual contact with a female. This assertion resulted in the Crown leading evidence in reply from Ms Andrews that the appellant had said to her in early 1999, “I love to have sex with girls …..but I also like to have sex with boys”. In 2002 he told Ms Andrews that he had sex with a female cast member. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 Admissibility of the police interviews with MW 
      
    17 As has already been noted, edited copies of the two videoed interviews which MW had with police on 9 September 2002 were admitted as evidence in the Crown case on the trial of allegations of sexual assault offences committed by the appellant upon AM. The interview did not contain any explicit reference to assaults allegedly committed upon MW by the appellant except that there was an account of an incident that could have been taken to be that giving rise to the first count in the indictment: the allegation of the three way kiss. There was some dispute before this Court as to the details of the matters contained in MW’s interviews, such as whether there was a reference to the incident giving rise to the first count or not. Because I have come to the view that there must be a new trial for other reasons, it is unnecessary for this Court to review the Judge’s exercise of discretion in any great detail. If the Crown presses the tender of MW’s interview at a re-trial, it will be for that trial judge to determine whether to admit the evidence or some part of it. 
     
      
    18 The appeal was conducted on the basis that the edited contents of MW’s interview were admissible because they were relevant and fell within the exception to the hearsay rule found in s 65(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, or that at least it was open to the Judge to find that it was so admissible. The argument before this Court centred on the Judge’s decision to admit the evidence notwithstanding his acknowledgment of its highly prejudicial nature. It was submitted that errors of principle occurred such that the decision to admit the evidence notwithstanding s 137 of the Evidence Act miscarried. It was submitted that the Judge misconceived the proper way in which the jury could use the evidence and that his reasons for admitting the evidence disclosed an inconsistency that went to the very heart of his decision. 
     
      
    19 MW’s interview contained evidence of uncharged sexual activity between the complainant and the appellant. There were allegations that had not been supported by the evidence of the complainant herself. However, they were relatively minor having regard to the complainant’s allegations. Whether such evidence should be admitted will depend upon the purpose for which it is being admitted and the probative value of the evidence to achieve that purpose. If the evidence is being admitted as context evidence, then its probative value will depend upon the need for the complainant’s specific allegations giving rise to the charges in the indictment to be put into context so the jury can understand the full nature of the allegations made by the complainant. If the evidence is being used to prove a tendency of the accused to indulge in sexual activity with the complainant, it has to pass through the test for admissibility under s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act. If it does so, it can be used by the jury as evidence of the commission of the offences charged. 
     
      
    20 Both context evidence and tendency evidence impact upon the credibility of the complainant but in different ways. By providing context to the specific allegations in the charges, the evidence makes the complainant’s account more intelligible and might explain aspects of her conduct, such as the absence of complaint. By proving a tendency of the accused, the evidence makes it more probable that the complainant is telling the truth in respect of the particular allegations because the accused is likely to have acted in the way that the complainant said he did. The principles set out in this and the previous paragraph seem to me to be uncontroversial and were decided some years ago in R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 and confirmed in R v Fraser (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 August 1998). 
     
      
    21 The interview of MW contained four discrete types of evidence relevant to the trial of allegations made by the complainant: direct evidence of one of the counts in the indictment; direct evidence of uncharged allegations of sexual assaults by the appellant upon the complainant; evidence of complaint by the complainant to MW about sexual acts committed by the appellant; and an alleged confession by the appellant to MW of sexual activity with the complainant. Clearly different considerations apply in determining whether to admit these different types of evidence regardless of the issue arising from the fact that MW was deceased and had never been subject to cross-examination. At the trial no attention, or insufficient attention, seems to have been given to the distinction between the different types of evidence and how the jury might use each of them. 
     
      
    22 For example, although there might be some argument as to whether the incident described by MW of the appellant kissing both him and the complainant was that to which the first count on the indictment related, the probative value of the evidence would clearly transcend its prejudicial value. The jury had evidence of such an event from the complainant. If MW was describing that event, as I believe he was, then it was direct evidence with no prejudicial effect other than to prove the allegation. If there were the possibility that MW was referring to some other occasion, then, unless the Crown intended to lead it as coincidence evidence, it had little probative value even though its prejudicial value might not have been great. It added little to what the complainant had said about the relationship between her and the appellant. 
     
      
    23 Similarly there were accounts in the interview of an alleged admission made by the accused to MW of sexual activity with the complainant of a nature similar to that contained in count 4 on the indictment. Clearly that admission might not have been able to be linked to that specific charge but that would not have meant that it was inadmissible. If the admission could be linked to count 4, it was direct evidence of the commission of that offence. If it could not be so linked, it was evidence to prove the sexual relationship between the appellant and the complainant. The evidence would, to my mind, have had little probative value to prove the context in which the complainant made her allegations, and if that was the purpose for which it was led, it seems to me that it should have been rejected because of its highly prejudicial nature in light of the fact that MW could not be cross-examined. It could also have been relied upon as evidence of the sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant. If this was to have been its use, the Crown ought to have issued a tendency notice in respect of that evidence. 
     
      
    24 The uncertainty as to whether the admission might have been linked to a particular charge and whether the account of the three way kiss related to the first count arose because MW’s interview raised particular allegations of other sexual acts between the complainant and the appellant about which the complainant did not give evidence. It was not clear whether the specific acts that were the basis of the charges were the only sexual acts that had been allegedly committed by the appellant against the complainant. The complainant was not asked about the other acts mentioned in MW’s interview during cross-examination. However, the failure of the complainant to mention them did not render the evidence of MW inadmissible. It was evidence of the relationship that existed between the complainant and the appellant other than as teacher and student, or budding actress and producer. It may have been admitted as evidence giving context to the complainant’s allegations or it might have been evidence of the appellant’s sexual interest in the complainant. If it were used as the latter, it was tendency evidence. 
     
      
    25 The material contained in MW’s interview and played to the jury was referred to generally in the trial and in the written submissions of the Crown before this Court as “context evidence”. The trial judge told the jury before the tape of MW’s interview was played as to the use that they could make of it. During these directions he said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is corroborative evidence of part of [the complainant’s] testimony and supports her allegations of a growing relationship between her and the accused. As such, it supports that evidence in [the complainant’s] account of events, which says there was a growing sexual relationship, and the allegations she makes did not just spring, as it were, from nowhere. They were in context. It is admitted and placed before you on that basis. 
        
       
      
    26 In determining to admit the evidence of MW’s interview, the only prejudicial aspect of MW’s evidence considered by the Judge, other than the inability of the defence to cross-examine him, was “a strong emotional demand not to disbelieve the dead”. No apparent regard was given to the prejudicial nature of the evidence, for example, flowing from the fact that the interview contained accounts of uncharged sexual activity to which no reference was made by the complainant. In other words no consideration was given to the fact that the jury might use the evidence or some part of it as tendency evidence if not warned against that approach. 
     
      
    27 Because no attention was given to the different types of evidence contained in the interview of MW when its admissibility was being considered, it was dealt with in a general way by the judge when deciding whether he should exclude it under s 137. Although the judge ultimately approached the question as to whether it should be rejected on the basis of weighing the probative value against its prejudicial effect, I do not believe, with respect, that the Judge paid sufficient regard to the nature of the evidence, the purpose for which it could be used by the jury, and its potential for unfair prejudice having regard to that purpose. If that had been done, I am by no means satisfied that all of the edited interview would have been admitted. For example, as I have already indicated, in my opinion the evidence of the alleged admission had so little weight as context evidence it should have been rejected under s 137. 
     
      
    28 In my opinion the significance of the fact that MW could not be cross-examined differed depending upon what part of his evidence was being considered and the purpose for which it was to be admitted. For example, it seems to me that there was little significance in the fact that MW could not be cross-examined in relation to his evidence of complaint by AM. That evidence was relevant, not because of context, but because it was evidence relevant to the consistency in the conduct of the complainant. The Judge told the jury that they could not use it as evidence of the truth of what the complainant said, so that it had limited probative value. There was other evidence of complaint in any event. However, it seems to me to be a very different matter when regard is had to the allegation that the appellant admitted having committed a sexual act upon the complainant. As I have already indicated, that had limited value as context evidence but was highly prejudicial. I do not see how it was open to a judge to admit the evidence in the absence of an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. 
     
      
    29 The Judge determined that there would be no danger of unfair prejudice inherent in the evidence outweighing its probative value for two reasons. The first was that the jury would be able to see the demeanour of MW in the video-recorded interview. The second reason was that the jury would be directed to take a two-step approach when dealing with the evidence in the Crown case. Firstly, the jury was to consider the evidence led by the Crown disregarding what was contained in MW’s interview. It was then to form an assessment, on the basis of that evidence, of whether they were “comfortably sure that the complainant was telling the truth, and telling it accurately”. If the jury reached that degree of satisfaction they could then have regard to the interview of MW to see whether it raised that belief to belief beyond reasonable doubt. This was how the Judge directed the jury they were to approach MW’s interview, both before the interview was played to them and during the summing up. 
     
      
    30 I understand the genesis of this approach was based upon the fact that the Judge saw MW’s evidence as purely corroborative and corroboration could not support evidence that was inherently unreliable. Therefore, the reasoning proceeds, before the jury could consider the interview of MW, they had to find the complainant reliable. But I believe there are a number of difficulties with this approach. Firstly, as I have already indicated, it blurs the different types of evidence contained in MW’s interview and offers the jury no assistance at all as to how to use the contents of the interview in determining whether it raised a belief in the complainant’s truth and reliability from comfortable satisfaction to belief beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    31 Secondly, it does not recognise that some of the evidence once admitted was not simply corroboration of the complainant but was direct evidence of the commission of the offences charged in the indictment. Nor does this manner of dealing with the evidence take sufficiently into account, in my opinion, the difference in the prejudicial effect arising from various parts of the interview. 
     
      
    32 Thirdly, this type of evidence has not been considered to be corroboration, certainly since the inception of the Evidence Act, and to simply refer to it as corroboration deflects attention from the basis of its admission under the rules of evidence contained in the Act. For example, the use of the term “corroboration” or a reference to the evidence being “corroborative” masks the fact that some of the evidence may have been regarded by the jury as tendency evidence and, therefore, insufficient regard was had to its prejudicial effect as such or to what directions to give about it to the jury. This is a matter raised by the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
    33 Fourthly, although the Judge determined at the outset of his reasons that the evidence had high probative value despite its highly prejudicial effect, he appears to have reduced its probative value by the two-step approach without necessarily reducing its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    34 Fifthly, notwithstanding that the courts consider the effectiveness of directions given to a jury on the basis that the jury will obey them, I believe that it is highly artificial in a case such as this to tell the jury to disregard a significant and prejudicial part of the Crown case while trying to determine whether they are comfortably satisfied with the complainant’s evidence. I also have difficulty in appreciating how evidence that is admitted only to give context to the complainant’s account can elevate her reliability from comfortable satisfaction to proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    35 Although under this ground of appeal complaint was made that the judge did not take into account the possibility that the jury might conclude that MW committed suicide, I do not believe that it would have done so. The jury knew that MW had died, but they did not know when that death occurred. It could have been any time between the taking of the interview and the trial: a period of about 2 years. They were told not to speculate about the cause of his death and, even if they did do so contrary to that direction, I do not believe they would have concluded that he had committed suicide. 
     
      
    36 It was submitted that, when the Judge was considering whether to exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Act, he took into account that the evidence would be subject of warnings under s 165 of the Act but he did not give those warnings in the summing up. Therefore, it was argued, the trial judge’s discretion miscarried. The Judge at the end of his judgment added, perhaps by way of afterthought, that the evidence would be accompanied by warnings under s 165(1)(a), (c) and (d). These are warnings that the evidence might be unreliable because it was evidence of hearsay or an admission (a), because it might have been affected by the witness’s age (c), and because the witness might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events (d). The only warning the Judge gave the jury was that in respect of it being hearsay evidence, untested by cross-examination. Defence counsel sought no other warning. 
     
      
    37 For my part I do not understand why the witness’s age of 14 meant that his evidence might be unreliable. Nor do I understand how the Judge might have warned the jury of the unreliability of his evidence because MW was complicit in the offences committed by the appellant. The Judge had already determined that the statements made by MW were not against interest because MW might not have seen his acts as more than “a breach of proper conduct originated and perpetrated by the accused”. This was hardly a case where the jury had to be warned that MW might have a reason for lying because he wanted to diminish his own criminality by making false allegations against the appellant. There was no error in the Judge not giving these warnings. But in any event, it is clear that the Judge had decided to admit the evidence before he considered that he was going to give warnings to the jury about its potential unreliability. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion the Judge erred in the manner in which he determined and dealt with the issue of whether he should reject the interview of MW under s 137. In my opinion there was a miscarriage of justice by the admission of the evidence and the way that the jury were invited to consider it. True it is that to some degree the Judge reduced the probative force of the evidence by the two-step approach, but the alleged admission made by the appellant to MW was highly prejudicial evidence that in my opinion should not have been admitted and certainly not as context evidence. The ground having been made out, the appeal must be allowed, the verdicts quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, it would be open for a judge on the retrial to admit some parts of the edited interview after a careful analysis of the contents of that interview and a proper assessment made of the probative value of its various parts as against their prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    40 The fact that the defence could not cross-examine MW was an important consideration but not necessarily a decisive one. However, as was pointed out in R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 82 at [127], each case has to be determined on its own particular facts depending upon the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect. Suteski was a very different case to the present. In the present case the fact that the defence could not cross-examine MW might have had more significance when considering some part of his evidence than it would when considering some other part of it. For example, it might be considered that it had more prejudicial impact in regards to the alleged admission rather than it did to the evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    41 Before leaving this ground of appeal, I should mention one matter that was not the subject of any argument but it may be a matter that should be considered if the Crown makes application to adduce the evidence at a retrial. The videotaped evidence of MW was made in accordance with s 7 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1977. The section in effect requires a police officer questioning a child under the age of 16 years to ensure that any representation made by the child during the questioning is recorded. The recording can be played as evidence in chief of the child under s 9. However s 11(2) requires that the child who gives evidence by that procedure be available for cross-examination and re-examination in the courtroom or by alternative arrangements such as video link. I understand that the evidence of MW’s interview was not played under these provisions, but it may be a relevant factor to be considered under s 137 of the Evidence Act that the legislature has mandated that in the normal case the child be available for cross-examination at the trial where a tape, made in accordance with s 7, is played to the jury. 
     
      
    42 It is very unsatisfactory that the appeal should be allowed because of the Crown’s desire to have MW’s interview admitted notwithstanding that he could not be cross-examined. In my opinion the Crown case against the appellant was a strong one even without that material having regard to the evidence supporting the complainant’s account. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 Admissibility of particular parts of AM’s interview 
      
    43 There were objections taken at the trial to particular questions and answers in AM’s interviews on the basis that they raised allegations of improper conduct by the appellant against Ms Andrews and MW. 
     
      
    44 The complainant gave evidence as to the circumstances in which she came to complain to Ms Andrews as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        So she [Ms Andrews] drove over from Narellan and she got there and then she told me everything that he had done to her, and then I said to her, “We’ve had sex and he’s taken me all the way” and I told her about [MW]”. 
        
       
       
      Later she said: 
       
       
        
        [Ms Andrews] said we can’t wait because if he does it to someone else he’s going to think he can get away with it and he’s going to think he’s had the better of that and we can’t let that happen. 
        
       
      
    45 It was submitted that these two portions of the interview were irrelevant but raised a suggestion that the appellant had been acting in a similar way with Ms Andrews. In fact Ms Andrews had alleged that the appellant had physically assaulted her, there had been a trial of that allegation and the appellant had been acquitted. Ms Andrews gave evidence at the trial and the jury were informed that she made “allegations of assault” against the appellant “but those allegations of assault were not of a sexual nature”. The Judge did not believe that it was appropriate for the jury to be told that the appellant had been acquitted of those allegations. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion it was open to the Judge to allow this evidence. As his Honour recognized, the evidence was significant because it was part of the circumstances in which the complaint to Ms Andrews arose. It helps explain why the complainant made her complaint to the other woman. Although it was prejudicial to the applicant, that prejudice was not great in the circumstances of this particular case. It was open to his Honour to come to the view that it should not be rejected under s 137. I do not have the same misgivings as his Honour did of the jury being informed that a jury had acquitted the appellant of any charge based upon those allegations. But even without that knowledge, I do not believe that the jury would have used that evidence to the prejudice of the accused such as to bring about a miscarriage of justice. Evidence was led that the appellant had no convictions and was a person of good character. Appropriate directions were given as to the use the jury was to make of that evidence. 
     
      
    47 The second passage quoted above does not in my view raise by itself or with the other passage a suggestion that the appellant had been misconducting himself with anybody but the complainant and perhaps Ms Andrews. Again it was open to his Honour to admit the evidence as part of the circumstances leading up to the complaint to AM’s parents. 
     
      
    48 The criticism in respect of the evidence relating to MW is the reference to him in the first passage quoted above. It was submitted that this was a reference to an earlier question and answer, excised from the interview placed before the jury, where the complainant had made a reference to the appellant sexually assaulting MW. Of course the jury were not aware of any of the allegations made by either AM or MW of sexual assaults against MW and one should have cared about reading too much into what was put before the jury with knowledge that the jury did not have. Again I do not believe that the Judge was required to reject that part of the conversation under s 137 on the basis that the jury might conclude that the complainant had told Ms Andrews about sexual assaults against MW. The jury did know of two incidents that did involve MW in allegations of sexual assaults upon the complainant from that portion of his interview placed before them. The jury could easily have concluded that this was what the complainant was referring to. 
     
      
    49 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 Directions concerning the interview of MW 
      
    50 It is unnecessary to determine this ground of appeal. It will be a matter for the trial judge to formulate what warning and directions to give to the jury if any part of the edited version of MW’s interview is admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    51 The chief criticism made of the present summing up was that the trial judge did not repeat to the jury the basis upon which they were to use the evidence of MW as context evidence and did not warn the jury against using it as a basis for propensity reasoning. No such direction was sought. It might be thought inadvisable in some cases to introduce the notion of tendency or propensity reasoning to the jury simply to warn them against such reasoning. However, it seems to me that the evidence of other sexual acts is so prejudicial when it comes from someone other than the complainant that such a warning should always be given because there is a very significant risk that the jury might use it in that way without understanding that they were prohibited from doing so. 
     
      
    52 During the summing up the Judge repeated to the jury the two-step approach they were to undertake with regard to MW’s evidence without indicating again the purpose for which that evidence was before them and at least warning the jury that it could not be used for any other purpose. In my opinion what the Judge said during the summing up or when the evidence was first introduced to the jury was insufficient to warn the jury against using the evidence in some other way. There was a real risk in this case that the jury might use the evidence or part of it by way of tendency reasoning and the jury should have been warned against such an approach. There was no need for the Judge to direct the jury against using any of the allegations of other sexual acts made by MW to replace any of the counts on the indictment because there was no real risk that they would do so. 
     
      
    53 It is unnecessary to consider any other challenge made to the directions given to the jury. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 5 and 6 
       
      Failure to give warning and directions with respect to the form of the evidence of the complainant and MW 
      
    54 It seems to me to be convenient to deal with these grounds together because the arguments in respect of them are largely identical. 
     
      
    55 The complainant gave evidence in chief substantially by the playing of her video-recorded interview with the police. She then gave further evidence by way of closed circuit television (CCTV). These procedures could be adopted by reason of the provisions of the Evidence (Children) Act 1977. This was because the complainant was under the age of 16 years at the time of the trial; see s 6. The recording of the complainant’s interview was admissible as evidence in chief under s 9(1)(a). She was entitled to give evidence by CCTV under s 18 of that Act. 
     
      
    56 In relation to the evidence given by playing the videotaped interview s 14 of that Act applied. That section states: 
     
      
       
        
        14 Warning to jury 
         
        If a child gives evidence of a previous representation wholly or partly in the form or a recording made by an investigating official in accordance with this Part in any proceedings in which there is a jury, the judge must warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the evidence being given in that way. 
        
       
       
      It should be noted that the section is in mandatory terms. 
       
      
    57 No such warning was given at any time during the trial in respect of the playing of the complainant’s videotaped interview. 
     
      
    58 MW’s videotaped interview with police was also played to the jury. The question arises whether s 14 applies. The Crown submitted that it does not because the evidence was admitted under s 65 of the Evidence Act and not under the provisions of the Evidence (Children) Act. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether the section does apply, but it would be a cautious approach to give such a warning whenever evidence is given in this form. In this particular case, the failure to give the warning, even if required under s 14 could not have led to a miscarriage of justice. As the jury knew that MW was dead, they could not have drawn any adverse inference about the use of that procedure against the appellant. The rest of the warning was concerned with the weight to be given to the evidence and the only prejudice to the appellant could be that the jury were not warned against giving greater weight to the evidence because it was in this form. In light of the directions given about the hearsay nature of the evidence and the fact that MW could not be cross-examined, no prejudice could have been suffered by the appellant by the failure to give this warning. 
     
      
    59 The written submissions received from both parties assume that the Judge failed to give the jury a warning in relation to the fact that the complainant gave evidence by way of CCTV. Section 25 of the Evidence (Children) Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        25 Warning to the jury 
         
        (1) In any criminal proceeding in which the evidence of a child is given by means of closed-circuit television facilities or any other similar technology (by virtue of section 18), the judge must: 
         
          
          (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure for children’s evidence in such cases to be given by those means, and 
           
          (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the use of those facilities or that technology. 
          
         
        
       
      
    60 During the course of his opening remarks to the jury the Judge told them, “some of this trial will be heard by way of CCTV”. He then went on to direct the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The complainant will be in another room, not very far from here because when exhibits are taken you can see the sheriff’s officer appearing on the screen. I would ask you not to draw any adverse inference against the accused because this device is being used, it’s a normal way these days in which evidence is taken in these cases – in this category of cases. Nor do I ask you to draw any inference adverse to the witness. I can assure you that these cameras are quite sensitive, they follow whoever is speaking, so if the barrister speaks at this end of the bar table the camera focuses on him and the young person in the room can see him. Or if the Crown speaks then it focuses on the Crown. And the barristers are very used to using this kind of technique these days and it’s really no inhibitor of cross-examination. And indeed I think that you probably get a better view of the witness using this technique than you do perhaps from the witness box. At least it does appear that it saves emotional upset in the sense of the young person having to give evidence before you twelve people sitting there and it is really devised for that purpose. I must say that we are having a let fewer breaks in the course of evidence because of this so I think perhaps it is an improvement on the older system. In all events I just ask you to regard it as a way in which it is done, no inference is to be drawn either way. 
        
       
      
    61 This direction only in part complied with s 25 as the Judge did not direct the jury that they were not to give more or less weight to the evidence because it was being given by this method. So far as the failure to comply with s 25 might have prejudiced the appellant, the only relevant omission was to tell the jury that they were not to give the evidence more weight because it was being taken by CCTV. In my view the risk of the jury giving that evidence more weight for that reason was so slight that the failure to give the part of the warning did not result in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    62 Insofar as the judge failed to warn the jury as required by s 14 in respect of the playing of the video tape of the complainant’s interview with police is concerned, it does not appear to me that the failure could have resulted in any miscarriage of justice in light of the warning that the Judge gave to the jury in relation to the complainant’s evidence being given by way of CCTV. The jury had been warned not to use the fact that the complainant was giving evidence by CCTV as giving rise to any adverse inference to the appellant and it is inconceivable, in my view, that the jury would, notwithstanding that direction, have treated in some way the use of the videotape recording as adverse to the appellant. 
     
      
    63 I do not believe that taken by itself the failure of the Judge to warn the jury against placing too much weight on the evidence in the complainant’s videotaped interview would have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. But when the absence of that warning is seen in the context of the failure to comply with the preferred procedure in relation to the use of videotaped interviews set out in R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278 the absence becomes more problematic. The preferred procedure in NZ requires the judge to warn the jury against giving too much weight to the videotaped interview if they were to be given access to it during the course of their deliberations. That warning was not given and therefore the jury were never warned about giving too much weight to the videotaped evidence. 
     
      
    64 As in my view there must be a retrial, it is unnecessary for any further consideration to be given to these grounds of appeal. However, it should be noted that it is unsatisfactory, to say the least, that neither counsel ensured that the Judge complied with ss 14 and 25 of the Evidence (Children) Act. The principal responsibility to ensure that there is compliance with the law in this regard falls upon the Crown. The Crown was calling the complainant as a witness and the Crown was seeking to have the tape of MW’s interview played to the jury. It was the Crown’s responsibility to ensure that the procedure adopted accorded with the Act and, therefore, that mandatory warnings were given to the jury as was required by the Act. 
     
      
    65 I propose that the appeal be allowed, the convictions and sentences be quashed, and that there be a retrial.

    3 HOWIE J: On 16 March 2006 this Court dismissed an appeal against conviction by each of the four appellants and indicated that it would publish its reasons later. These are the reasons for which I joined in the order dismissing the appeals. 
     
      
    4 The four appellants and a fifth accused, BD, were arraigned before a jury and Judge Keleman SC (the Judge) on an indictment containing seven counts to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Robbery of Mr Li while armed with an offensive weapon, being a knife (s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        2. Robbery of Mr Hu while armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife (s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        3. While in company of each other detained Mr Li with intent to obtain a financial gain (s 86(2)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        4. While in company of each other detained Mr Hu with intent to obtain a financial gain (s 86(2)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        5. By threat of unlawful violence to Mr Li and his family, compelled him to affix a name to a paper with intent to defraud (s 103 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        6. By threat of unlawful violence to Mr Li and his family, compelled him to endorse a valuable security with intent to defraud (s 103 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
         
        7. By threat of unlawful violence to Mr Li and his family compelled him to endorse part of a valuable security with intent to defraud (s 103 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        ). 
         
        
       
       
      Each of the appellants and the co-accused pleaded not guilty and was tried before the Judge and the jury. 
       
      
    5 On day 13 of the trial and after the Crown's principal witnesses, Mr Li and Mr Hu, had given evidence, the Crown applied pursuant to s 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act for leave to amend the indictment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Counts 1 and 2: the word ""firearm"" to be substituted for the word ""knife"". 
         
         
        Counts 6 and 7: the words ""write upon a paper"" to be substituted for the words “indorse a valuable security"". 
        
       
       
      The application was opposed by counsel for the appellants principally on the basis that it would result in an injustice in light of the manner in which the witnesses had been cross-examined. However, the Judge permitted the Crown leave to amend the indictment and it was amended accordingly. 
       
      
    6 The jury convicted each of the appellants and the co-offender of all counts on the indictment. The appellants have appealed against their convictions on a single ground that asserts that the Judge erred in the exercise of his discretion by allowing the amendment and as a result there was a miscarriage of justice insofar as the appellants were convicted on the amended charges. 
     
      
    7 By reason of the nature of the ground of appeal relied upon, the facts can be dealt with very briefly. The appellant James Borodin owned a company that manufactured formwork for building construction. The company entered into a contract with a building company with respect to a large residential unit development. However, a dispute arose between the two companies and as a result the contract was terminated in June 2001. Mr Borodin’s company then commenced civil proceedings for the return of building materials said to be worth over $1 million. 
     
      
    8 Mr Li conducted an accountancy practice and was the accountant for the building company and the developer. Mr Hu was employed in that practice. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case was that in the early evening of 12 July 2002, the appellants and ED, the teenage daughter of the Borodins, entered Mr Li’s offices where Mr Hu was present at the time. Mr Borodin was armed with a gun that had a silencer fitted and a magazine. The appellant Bogomiagkov, at Mr Borodin’s direction, handcuffed Mr Li and then Mr Hu. Bogomiagkov, who had a knife secreted on him, at some stage briefly threatened the two victims with it. 
     
      
    10 Mrs Borodin told Mr Li that they wanted money. ED attempted to operate a computer in order to gain access to on-line banking facilities but was unsuccessful. At Mrs Borodin’s direction, Bogomiagkov searched the two men and money was taken from Mr Li and a bankcard from Mr Hu. The theft of this property gave rise to the two counts of armed robbery. Mr Li said he did not have a credit card, but he was accused of lying and threatened that, if he did not reveal the password for his credit card, his family would be harmed. 
     
      
    11 At Mrs Borodin’s direction, Mr Li accessed on his computer a form for the electronic transfer of funds from the building company's account. The form was printed and signatures were photocopied on to it from a similar form that had previously been used to transfer money from the building company to Mr Borodin’s company. This conduct gave rise to count 5 on the indictment. Also, at Mrs Borodin’s direction, Mr Li drew a cheque from the developer’s account and forged the signature upon it. This conduct gave rise to count 7. Further, at her direction, Mr Li signed a cheque on his business’s account for $85,000 without filling in the name of the payee. This gave rise to count 6. Mr Li at gunpoint sent the forged transfer form by fax. 
     
      
    12 Mr Borodin and Bogomiagkov then forced the two men into Mr Li’s motor vehicle and they drove to the Borodin's family home in a suburb on the outskirts of Sydney. This conduct gave rise to counts 3 and 4 on the indictment. Before leaving, Mr Hu had divulged his PIN for the stolen bankcard and Mrs Borodin and ED went to an automatic teller machine and withdrew $1000. They then travelled independently to the family home. There, during lengthy discussions, Mr Li explained that he was not responsible for the termination of the contract nor had he access to money relating to the building project. After giving assurances that they would not report what happened to the police, the two men were released. 
     
      
    13 The police were contacted a short time later and eventually the appellants and ED were arrested. Mr Borodin in a recorded interview denied the accusations. He maintained that he was at home on the night of the incident. Mrs Borodin also told police that she was at home on the night in question and denied that she had ever been in Mr Li’s offices. Mr Bogomiagkov said that on the relevant day he had been working at Silverwater and then travelled to a friend’s place at Toongabbie with ED where they spent the evening until about 11.30pm. ED gave a similar account saying that she had been studying at home before going with Bogomiagkov to his friend’s home. She said they arrived back home about 11.30pm. 
     
      
    14 The only accused to give evidence at the trial was Mrs Borodin. She denied the offences, raised good character and gave evidence of an alibi. She said that she had received a letter threatening to kill them if they did not drop the civil action. She also maintained that her husband had gone missing for two days in September 2002 and was later found lying injured and half-conscious in their driveway. 
     
      
    15 The defence case for each of the appellants was that the evidence of Mr Li and Mr Hu was fabricated and that telephone and commuter records had been tampered with in order to support their account. 
     
      
    16 In answer to the Crown’s application for leave to amend the indictment, written submissions were prepared by one of the two defence counsel setting out the history of the matter and the changing positions of the Crown as to the particulars of the offences with respect to the weapon said to have been used in the robbery. Under the heading “A brief analysis of the evidence of robbery armed with a firearm” is the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The evidence of both Li and Hu is to the effect that the accused James Borodin stood in the area in or near the doorway to the office of Jerry Li and was either holding or pointing the gun whilst the subject property was stolen. 
         
         
        Each of the alleged victims was cross-examined in a manner which encouraged each of them to highlight the role of the gun at that point in the alleged chain of events. This was done with the forensic purpose (and one hopes the effect) of distracting each of the alleged victims from the role, if any, of the knife or that the young male could still be said to have possession of the knife. 
         
         
        Similarly, each of the alleged victims was encouraged in cross-examination to the view that the young male searched the alleged victim Hu (and therefore engaged in the activities) with both hands and with both such hands being covered by surgical gloves. This again was done with a view to raising some doubt as to the role, presence or possession of the knife. 
        
       
      
    17 As Mr Bodor SC counsel for the appellants explained, defence counsel had cross-examined the two witnesses based upon an allegation that the weapon used for the purpose of achieving the robbery was the gun and not the knife. This was so that a submission could be made to the jury that they would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the victims parted with their property by reason of the threat of violence arising from Bogomiagkov’s use of a knife, as alleged in the counts in the indictment, but rather because of the threat arising from Mr Borodin's use of the firearm. In this way it was to be argued that, even if the jury might be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the account given by Mr Li and Mr Hu was reliable, the Crown case should still fail on the armed robbery counts. 
     
      
    18 In relation to counts 6 and 7, the written submissions for the defence stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Li gave evidence to the effect that he filled out part only of the cheque forms. 
         
         
        Counsel for these accused immediately apprehended that the documents may not satisfy the definition of ""valuable security"" or even ""part of a valuable security"" as averred to in the indictment. 
         
         
        A forensic decision was taken to substantially leave this area of the allegations to one side in cross-examination and seek verdicts by direction as to Counts 6 and 7 at the conclusion of the Crown case rather than cross-examine. In taking such a forensic decision the time involved in the witness (sic) giving all of their evidence, and in particular the time spent under cross-examination give (sic) rise to the need for trial counsel to balance the need to cross-examination against the risk that the witness will attract the sympathy of the jury due to the sustained and lengthy nature of cross-examination. 
         
         
        These accused have lost the opportunity to cross-examine on a range of significant matters going substantially to the credit of the witnesses Li and Hu. Such lost opportunities include: 
         
         
          
          (i) cross-examination seeking to drawing (sic) attention to the role of the knife in an endeavour to distract attention from the use of the gun (and seek to raise doubts as to the use of the gun). 
           
           
          (ii) the manner of the use of the gun. 
           
           
          (iii) the testing of the nature of content of what was written on the cheque forms or if anything was written on them at all 
           
           
          (iv) any inconsistencies between Li and Hu in this regard. 
           
           
          (v) a further exploration (and forensic exploitation) of Hu’s relatively less certain view of any dealings with cheque forms. 
           
           
          The above list is far from exhaustive and presents but a few examples. 
           
           
          The Crown failed to amend the indictment in a timely fashion. The authorities speak of a likely unfairness when such amendments are sought in the later stages of the trial. The loss of opportunity to cross-examine on issues of credit due to a substantive failure of the Crown to disclose relevant matters represents an unfairness to the accused – see  
          Grey 
           v  
          The Queen 
           [2001] HCA 65. 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 The Judge gave reasons for permitting the amendment. Mr Bodor did not, in either his written or oral submissions to the Court, identify any error in the reasons given by the Judge. When asked what was the error in the exercise of the discretion in accordance with the test propounded in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, Mr Bodor replied in effect that the amendments had brought about an injustice by depriving the appellants of tactical decisions made by defence counsel. 
     
      
    20 The Judge noted that the relevant principles were contained in the decision of R v Stuart (NSWCCA, unreported, 8 March 1996) in the following passage quoted by his Honour in the course of his judgment (citations not produced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        An indictment may be amended in order to cure a defect contained in it even at a late stage of the trial. Permissible amendments are not limited to formal matters, but may deal with substantial matters. A count may be substituted where the facts proved justify conviction under the amended count. The question which the trial judge must answer in exercising discretion whether to allow the required amendment is whether it can be made without injustice. 
        
       
      
    21 The Judge came to the view that, despite a complaint by defence counsel that they would have cross-examined the two witnesses differently had the charge referred to the gun rather than the knife, no injustice would be caused by the amendment of the indictment. He offered to have the two witnesses recalled for further cross-examination but this offer was not taken up. 
     
      
    22 In relation to the amendment to counts 6 and 7, the Judge noted that the amendment was to change one of the elements of the offence, as set out in s 103 of the Crimes Act, so that each count accorded with the evidence but without changing the actual conduct that was the subject of each of the charges: the signing of the relevant cheque. In R v Cook (NSWCCA, unreported, 9 May 1990) the amendment to the indictment was made at the end of the Crown case. Notwithstanding the lateness of the change to the wording of the charge, it was held that there was no injustice arising because the factual basis for the charge did not change and the wording of the charge more appropriately reflected the evidence in the Crown case. The Court rejected an argument that the power to amend an indictment was limited to technicalities. 
     
      
    23 In cases such as the present there is strictly speaking no appeal against the exercise of the Judge’s discretion. The appeal is concerned with whether there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the amendment of the indictment. A miscarriage of justice will be shown where the amendment resulted in an unfair trial, whether that unfairness was a result of tactical decisions made by defence counsel based upon the wording of the charge or otherwise. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion it is impossible to see how the amendments resulted in an unfair trial. The only prejudice suffered by the appellants was that the counts in the indictment were to be determined on their merits. With respect I agree with the Judge that it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how, in light of the nature of defence case, the cross-examination might have been significantly different had the indictment been amended at an earlier point in the trial. In any event the Judge offered to have the witnesses recalled and I do not understand how the appellants would have been further prejudiced by that offer being taken up. 
     
      
    25 Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act permits the court to make orders for amendment of an indictment where to do so would not result in injustice. Relevant injustice does not arise simply because the amendment of the charge deprives the accused of taking a technical point based upon an inconsistency between the statement of the charge and the evidence in support of it. Tactical decisions may have been made by the defence upon the basis of the wording of the charge, but it does not follow that the trial judge should refuse leave to amend the indictment simply because those tactical decisions will be rendered fruitless. It will only be in a case where the accused would be irreparably prejudiced in meeting the charge as amended that leave should be refused. 
     
      
    26 In the present case there was no miscarriage of justice resulting from the amendment of the indictment and, therefore, the ground of appeal should be rejected.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Le Huynh applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 2 December 2004 by his Honour Judge Shillington, after he had pleaded guilty to four charges, namely:- 
     
      
       
      1. Supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) on 21 June 2004. 
       
       
      2. Supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) on an ongoing basis on three or more separate occasions between 3 June 2004 and 19 June 2004. 
       
       
      3. Possessing a pistol on 21 June 2004, without being authorised to do so. 
       
       
      4. Goods in custody being an amount of cash. 
       
      
    2 For each of the offences of supplying a prohibited drug and supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years commencing on 21 June 2004, the date on which the applicant had been arrested and from which he had remained in custody. For the offence of possessing a pistol without being authorised his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment, also commencing on 21 June 2004. 
     
      
    3 For the offence of goods in custody which was dealt with in accordance with Div 7 of Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of six months, also commencing on 21 June 2004. 
     
      
    4 Supplying a prohibited drug is an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fifteen years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.  
     
      
    5 Supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis is an offence under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty years and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units. 
     
      
    6 Possessing a prohibited firearm or pistol without being authorised to do so is an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fourteen years. There is a standard non-parole period of three years for an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act. 
     
      
    7 In the proceedings on sentence a statement of the facts of the drug offences and a statement of the facts of the firearms offence were admitted without objection and in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge briefly summarised those statements. The following statement of the facts of the offences is largely derived from his Honour’s summary. 
     
      
    8 On each of 3 June, 9 June, 18 June and 19 June 2004 the applicant supplied a quantity of approximately .2 of a gram of heroin to an undercover police operative for a price of $50 or, in one case, $70. These supplies gave rise to the charge of supplying on an ongoing basis.  
     
      
    9 On 21 June 2004, after the applicant had agreed to supply the undercover operative with a further amount of heroin, the applicant was arrested. 
     
      
    10 When the applicant was searched after having been arrested, a plastic bag containing heroin and two other small plastic bags containing heroin were found. The total amount of heroin found was 8.53 grams. The possession of this amount of heroin, which exceeded the trafficable quantity for heroin of 3 grams, gave rise to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    11 After he had been arrested the applicant informed police of the presence of a pistol in a safe at his home. Police applied for and were granted a warrant to search the applicant’s home. When the warrant was executed police located the safe. The applicant assisted police in opening the safe by entering the correct combination. Inside the safe police found a pistol with two live rounds in the magazine well of the pistol. The serial number of the pistol had been obscured. The applicant did not hold a licence for the pistol under the Firearms Act. 
     
      
    12 When the applicant was searched police found a total of $3,550 in cash in one of his pockets. The possession by the applicant of this cash gave rise to the charge of goods in custody. 
     
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence Judge Shillington noted that a controlled operation had been set up by police, after information had been received about drug transactions occurring at or near premises in Punchbowl occupied by the applicant’s mother. The supplies of heroin to the undercover operative on 3, 9 and 19 June had occurred in the vicinity of those premises. The supply of heroin on 18 June 2004 had occurred at Roselands Shopping Centre. His Honour noted that the applicant had arrived at Roselands driving a BMW car. 
     
      
    14 In his remarks on sentence his Honour rejected a submission made by the applicant’s counsel in the proceedings on sentence that, having regard to the small quantities of heroin supplied, the applicant should be regarded as a street dealer. His Honour concluded that the applicant’s role was “a more significant” one. His Honour found that the possession of a firearm was consistent with the applicant being “a serious operative in the drug trade”. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was born in Vietnam on 2 June 1981. He came to Australia when he was three years old. When the applicant was in primary school his mother had become seriously disabled as a result of her attempting to commit suicide and sustaining burns to 80 per cent of her body. The applicant’s father died of cancer about four years prior to the applicant being sentenced. 
     
      
    16 The applicant obtained a school certificate but was suspended on a number of occasions and finally expelled from school. After leaving school, he had only short periods of employment. At the time he was arrested the applicant was in a relationship with a young woman. 
     
      
    17 The applicant began using cannabis at the age of nineteen and became seriously addicted. The applicant began using heroin in 2004 and he and his partner became addicted to heroin. The sentencing judge noted in his remarks on sentence a claim by the applicant that his own addiction was the reason why he was involved in the sale of drugs to others. His Honour made no express finding about whether he accepted this claim. 
     
      
    18 The applicant had a substantial criminal record, including convictions for drug offences and for firearms offences. His criminal history included the following entries. 
     
      
    19 In 2002 the applicant had been sentenced for a number of firearms offences to concurrent terms of imprisonment of sixteen months, commencing on 17 September 2002 with non-parole periods of twelve months expiring on 16 September 2003.  
     
      
    20 In 2003 for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug the applicant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eighteen months commencing on 17 March 2003 with a non-parole period of nine months expiring on 16 December 2003. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was released on parole on 16 December 2003 and was on this parole when all of the present offences were committed. On 29 July 2004 his parole was revoked and the applicant was required to serve a balance of parole, being a fixed term of three months seven days commencing on 22 June 2004 and expiring on 28 September 2004. 
     
      
    22 In his remarks on sentence Judge Shillington found that the pleas of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity, that the applicant had co-operated with police in informing them about the pistol and that these facts suggested some contrition on the part of the applicant. His Honour found special circumstances in the applicant’s youth and his need for supervision on his release from prison. His Honour stated that the two drug offences arose from the same criminal activity and for that reason the sentences for the two offences should be served concurrently. 
     
      
    23 On this appeal the applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentences imposed for deemed supply of heroin and ongoing supply of heroin are in error in regard to the application of proper principle as to totality in sentencing. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence imposed for deemed supply of heroin is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentence imposed for ongoing supply of heroin is manifestly excessive”. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    24 The essence of counsel for the applicant’s submissions on this ground was that the sentencing judge had failed to apply the principles of sentencing stated in the well known passage in the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 (45), where their Honours said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality”. 
        
       
      
    25 It is true that in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346 the High Court held that, while it is preferable for a judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence to apply the principles stated in Pearce, a judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence is not prohibited from achieving an appropriate total sentence by the means of lowering the sentences for the individual offences and then aggregating them (Johnson at par 26). However, in the present case it is clear that the sentencing judge did not proceed by adopting this means of sentencing. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion, there are, as was submitted by counsel for the applicant, strong indications in the sentences imposed that the sentencing judge did not apply the principles stated in Pearce. The sentences for the two drug offences, regardless of any differences between them, were made of equal length and the sentences were made fully concurrent with each other. The sentence for the firearms offence was made fully concurrent with the first three years of the sentences for the drug offences.  
     
      
    27 I would uphold the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    28 The supply of heroin for which the applicant was sentenced was a deemed supply under s 29 of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act. The quantity of heroin in the possession of the applicant was 8½ grams, which, according to an analyst’s certificate, had a purity of only 28 per cent. 
     
      
    29 Under the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act the trafficable quantity for heroin, the possession of which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of having possession for supply, is 3 grams and the commercial quantity for heroin is 250 grams. Hence, the quantity of heroin in the applicant’s possession was little more than the trafficable quantity and close to the bottom of the range of quantities which give rise to an offence under s 25(1) of the Act (but not an offence under s 25(2) of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of the drug). 
     
      
    30 It is true that in sentencing for drug offences there are other factors to be taken into account, apart from the quantity of the drug involved, but the quantity of the drug involved remains important and in the present case there were no special circumstances which would make the supply of a relatively small quantity of a drug an offence of greater than usual objective seriousness. Compare Markarian v The Queen (2005) 215 ALR 213 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ at (33). 
     
      
    31 In the present case the applicant had pleaded guilty and the sentencing judge had found that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity and had demonstrated some contrition, with the consequence that the applicant should have received a discount in sentencing for his plea of guilty and contrition. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion, notwithstanding the presence of some aggravating factors to which the sentencing judge referred in his remarks on sentence, a sentence of eight years for an offence of a deemed supply of 8½ grams of heroin of a purity of 28 per cent, to which the applicant had made an early plea of guilty and where there were no circumstances rendering the offence especially objectively serious, was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    33 I would uphold the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    34 I have upheld the first two grounds of appeal, namely that in sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge failed to comply with the principles of sentencing in Pearce and that the sentencing judge imposed a manifestly excessive sentence for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. The sentencing judge made the sentence for the offence of the ongoing supply of drugs equal to, and fully concurrent with, the sentence for supplying a prohibited drug. In all of these circumstances, I consider that it should be held that the sentencing of the applicant miscarried generally and this Court should intervene generally and re-sentence the applicant for all of the offences, without it being necessary to consider whether the third ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
    35 I have earlier in this judgment set out the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant and there is no need to repeat these matters. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account the principles of sentencing stated in Pearce and the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is convenient to deal first with the offence under the Firearms Act. 
     
      
    36 I would not impose any different sentence for the offence under the Firearms Act from that imposed by the sentencing judge, that is a fixed term of imprisonment (or a non-parole period) of three years. This sentence is equal to the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act.  
     
      
    37 There were aggravating factors in that the firearm contained two live rounds and the serial number had been obscured and the applicant had previous convictions for firearms offences.  
     
      
    38 On the other hand, the applicant had informed police about the firearm, the firearm was being kept securely in a safe, the applicant assisted police by opening the safe and the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence.  
     
      
    39 I will now consider the sentence which this Court should impose for the offence of the ongoing supply of drugs. 
     
      
    40 In submitting that the sentence imposed by the primary judge was manifestly excessive, counsel for the applicant had stressed that the quantity of the drug supplied on each occasion was very small. 
     
      
    41 Counsel for the applicant submitted to the Court a table setting out short particulars of twenty-eight cases which have come before this Court of sentences for offences under s 25A of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act. Of these cases the sentence imposed on the applicant by the primary judge is the heaviest sentence which has been imposed on any offender, apart from the two co-offenders in R v Huang: R v Lin [2001] NSWCCA 76. It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the criminality of both Huang and Lin was at a much higher level than the criminality of the applicant. 
     
      
    42 Other cases to which the Court’s attention was particularly drawn by counsel for the applicant were R v Jordan [2002] NSWCCA 228, R v Siljanovski: R v Kostadinovic [2003] NSWCCA 38, R v Koklas [2003] NSWCCA 302, R v Mucenski [2004] NSWCCA 299. 
     
      
    43 A number of submissions were made by the Crown about the sentencing of the applicant for the offence under s 25A. 
     
      
    44 It was submitted that s 25A is not primarily concerned with the quantity of the drug supplied. In R v Giang [2005] NSWCCA 387 Hulme J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at paragraph (18), with respect to sentencing for offences under s 25A:- 
     
      
       
        
        “While quantity is a relevant consideration in the determination of the proper penalty, it is wrong to look merely at the quantity supplied and to attempt to judge an offender’s conduct by that quantity and those provisions of the Act which impose penalties for supply and grade those penalties by reference to quantity. The persons at whom the section is directed are those who are indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs – see  
        Simiroldo  
        (2000) 112 A Crim R 47 at 50-51 (15);  
        R v Hoon 
        ;  
        R v Pouoa 
         [2000] NSWCCA 137 at (39) et seq.” 
        
       
      
    45 The Crown submitted that it was clear, and the sentencing judge had found, that the applicant had engaged in the selling of drugs on more than simply the four occasions relied on to establish the offence. This was a matter which could properly be taken into account in sentencing the applicant (Giang at par 17). 
     
      
    46 The sentencing judge had found that the applicant’s role was “more significant” than that of being a mere street dealer and that the applicant’s possession of a firearm was consistent with his being a serious operative in the drug trade. 
     
      
    47 As the applicant had previous convictions for the supply of drugs, more weight could properly be given in the sentencing of the applicant to some of the purposes of punishment, such as individual deterrence. 
     
      
    48 The offence had been committed while the applicant was on parole and the fact that the offence had been committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty was an important circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    49 Even if the sentencing judge should be taken as having accepted the applicant’s claim that he had engaged in drug dealing in order to support his own addiction, that was not a circumstance of mitigation R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
    50 As regards the submissions made by counsel for the applicant on the basis of the table of cases put before this Court, the cases in the table were limited to cases which had come before this Court and did not extend to sentences for offences under s 25A generally. As this Court has repeatedly said, the penalty which a court should impose in a particular case cannot, except in the case of co-offenders, be arrived at by a detailed comparison of the particular case with some other case or even a number of other cases. 
     
      
    51 I have taken into account the submissions made on behalf of the parties. 
     
      
    52 I accept that caution should be exercised in considering the other cases of sentences for offences under s 25A which were submitted to this Court by counsel for the applicant. However, these other cases (and counsel for the Crown on this application did not refer the Court to any other cases) do appear to me to indicate that the sentence imposed by the primary judge on the applicant, even if not manifestly excessive, was very severe and higher than this Court should impose. 
     
      
    53 In R v Huang: R v Lin the two applicants were co-offenders. Huang supplied heroin on three occasions to an undercover operative, the heroin being provided by Lin. Each of Huang and Lin pleaded guilty to a charge under s 25A. The sentencing judge sentenced Huang to a term of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of six years and Lin to a term of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. For a separate offence Lin was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years upon which the sentence for the offence under s 25A was made fully cumulative. Appeals by Huang and Lin against the severity of their sentences were dismissed by this Court. 
     
      
    54 In Huang and Lin the quantities of the drug supplied were very much greater than the amounts in the present case, being 27.9 grams, 83.5 grams and 346 grams and the degree of purity of the drug was much higher, namely about 70 per cent. The amount paid for the drug supplied on the last occasion was $72,000. Even though the quantities of the drug supplied are by no means the only matter to be considered when sentencing for offences under s 25A and effect must be given to the evident purpose of s 25A, I consider that it is of some significance in the present case that the quantities supplied were so small and that the degree of purity of the drug was so low. 
     
      
    55 Taking into account the objective facts, the subjective features of the applicant, the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the submissions of the parties, I consider that a total sentence of six years should be imposed for the offence under s 25A. 
     
      
    56 Taking the same matters into account, I would impose a sentence of a non-parole period or fixed term of imprisonment for three years for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. I would impose the same sentence as the primary judge for the offence of goods in custody. 
     
      
    57 I would find special circumstances in the circumstances found by the sentencing judge to be special circumstances and I would maintain approximately the same ratio between the total effective sentence and the total effective non-parole period. 
     
      
    58 In accordance with the statement of principles of sentencing in Pearce, I have regard to questions of totality and cumulation and concurrence of sentences. 
     
      
    59 In my opinion the following orders should be made. 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal against sentence allowed and the sentences imposed by Judge Shillington on 2 December 2004 quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced:- 
       
       
        
        (i) For the offence under s 7(1) of the  
        Firearms Act 
         to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 21 June 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) For the offence under s 25(1) of the  
        Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act  
        to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing on 21 December 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) For the offence under s 25A of the  
        Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act  
        to a non-parole period of three years four months commencing on 21 June 2005 and a balance of term of two years eight months. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) For the offence of goods in custody to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months commencing on 21 June 2004. 
        
       
      
    60 The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 20 October 2008. 
     
      
    61 The total effect of the sentences would be that the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with non-parole periods or fixed terms totalling four years four months.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
      Nature of claim 
       
      On 2 May 2001 between 5pm and 10pm the plaintiff suffered injuries when he fell approximately four metres down an embankment into a creek bed. At the time he and his wife were lessees of premises known as Lot 1, Old Princes Highway, Broughton Village in the State of New South Wales. This was a one acre rural property in the Kangaroo Valley area. 
       
      
    2 The defendants are the owners and the lessors of that property. The plaintiff has brought a claim in negligence against them on the basis that they were in breach of the duty, which they owed to him as lessors, in that they failed to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury. 
     
      
    3 The essence of the plaintiff’s complaint is that water was supplied to the property from a nearby creek by means of a pump situated above that creek. It was necessary on a frequent basis to prime the pump in order to maintain a supply of water. It was the plaintiff’s case that the pump was located so close to the edge of the embankment above the creek that a person priming the pump was exposed to the risk of falling and that this is what happened on 2 May 2001. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    4 Although there were a number of disputed issues of fact, the general background was relatively uncontroversial. I have indicated those matters which were in dispute. Except as otherwise indicated, I find the factual background to be as set out in the following paragraphs. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff was born on 6 July 1972. At the end of 1990 he left Bomaderry High School, having completed year 12. He travelled to the United Kingdom and after some months returned home. Thereafter he worked in the following capacities: February 1991 – casual security guard; October 1991 – casual farmhand; December 1991–March 1992 – casual fruit picker and February 1992 – casual labourer. 
     
      
    6 In March 1992 the plaintiff applied to join the Navy. The application was successful and on 20 July 1992 he entered the Navy. He was discharged from the Navy on 11 September 1996. During his period with the Navy, the plaintiff served in the submarine branch of that service. Although he enjoyed that work, he resigned from the Navy because he was almost constantly at sea and had very little shore time. While in the Navy he worked mostly as a sonar operator. 
     
      
    7 Although the plaintiff had completed a number of courses in the Navy and during his last posting had been typing letters for superiors, I formed the opinion that his skills were essentially manual. Not only did he have no interest in sedentary work but had shown little aptitude for it. The examples of his written work, which were placed before me, supported that conclusion. 
     
      
    8 In relation to his health, the plaintiff was only prepared to concede an irritable bowel syndrome during his naval service and some football injuries. The plaintiff did, however, refer to a fall down some stairs but little detail was provided. 
     
      
    9 Under cross-examination it emerged that the fall down the stairs had occurred in May 1996 and had been quite serious. It was associated with an episode of binge drinking. The plaintiff suffered injuries to his back and neck and thereafter experienced back pain on an intermittent basis. He also suffered a head injury with loss of consciousness and some post-traumatic amnesia for about six days. At the time of his discharge from the Navy, he was still complaining of back pain. 
     
      
    10 It also emerged that shortly after his discharge from the Navy, he had been assaulted and severely beaten while in Kings Cross. He had lost consciousness in the course of that assault and required a laparotomy. This incident formed the basis of a claim to the Victims’ Compensation Tribunal. 
     
      
    11 Another incident occurred in June 1999 in Dubbo. The plaintiff was assaulted by four assailants. He was struck on the right side of the face by a wooden post, fell to the ground and was kicked. He lost consciousness and was not aware of anything until he woke at the Dubbo Base Hospital. He was discharged after 24 hours. He suffered injuries to his head, face and low back. A CT scan of the brain and other x-rays showed no abnormality. He was left with some numbness in the face. 
     
      
    12 Between September 1996 and May 2001 when the accident occurred, the plaintiff suffered from intermittent back pain. On occasions he wore a back brace. This back pain did not prevent the plaintiff from engaging in heavy labouring work. The plaintiff agreed that while in the Navy he had engaged in binge drinking while on shore leave but said that otherwise his consumption of alcohol was moderate. 
     
      
    13 I formed the opinion that the plaintiff had not been entirely candid with the court when giving evidence in chief as to previous health problems. 
     
      
    14 After his discharge from the Navy, the plaintiff went back to farm labouring work. He did work repairing tractors for a period of time. During 1998 and early 1999 he worked at the Cudgegong Abattoirs at Mudgee. For over six months during 1999 the plaintiff worked for Blue Line, an air conditioning company. He met his wife, Kellie, in 1999 and they were married on 15 April 2000. After meeting Kellie the plaintiff moved to Sydney where he worked as a baggage handler at Sydney Airport. He did not like living in the city. 
     
      
    15 In early 2000 the plaintiff and Kellie formed the intention of moving to the Kangaroo Valley area. The plaintiff had large dogs which required considerable space – three Great Danes and a Kelpie. They found that landlords were reluctant to lease premises where the proposed lessees had large dogs. It was also the plaintiff’s intention to start a business of his own in which he would perform contract labouring and other work for landowners in the Kangaroo Valley area. By June 2000 the plaintiff had commenced his business but he and Kellie had been unsuccessful in obtaining suitable premises from which he could run that business and care for the dogs. 
     
      
    16 In mid June an advertisement in a post office came to the plaintiff’s attention. It had been placed by the tenants of the property, the subject of these proceedings, who wanted someone to take over their lease. As a result of that advertisement the plaintiff and his wife inspected the property, contacted the agents, who were Ray White at Nowra, and on 26 June 2000 entered into a residential tenancy agreement (exhibit E). Although the tenancy agreement was signed on 26 June 2000, the plaintiff and his wife did not actually occupy the property until 6 July 2000. When the lease term expired in February 2001, the plaintiff and his wife remained on the property on a monthly tenancy. 
     
      
    17 The property comprised an old house, an old shed, a small garage and an elevated water tank, which held between 400 and 500 gallons. A fuller description of the property is contained in Exhibit L, a report of Dr Neil Adams and Associates, dated 9 July 2002. That report also contains useful photographs of the property. 
     
      
    18 The evidence of the plaintiff was that he was told by the former tenant that there was a pump by the creek but that he did not inspect it before entering into the lease. The rent was $150 per week, which in his opinion was about average for the area. It was not unusual in that area to have a pump system for the supply of water. He and his wife were eager to enter into the lease. This was because the property was suitable for his business and they needed a place for the dogs. 
     
      
    19 There were no direct negotiations with the defendants. The plaintiff did not meet Mr Mitchell until he had been in occupation for about two weeks. All the negotiations in relation to the lease were carried out by Kellie with the Ray White Real Estate Agency. The plaintiff’s only participation was to sign the lease and assist Kellie in making a list of defects in the premises before the lease was signed. 
     
      
    20 There was no mains water supply to the house. Water came from a nearby creek (Broughton Creek) by means of a pump to the water tank. Water came to the house from the water tank by gravity flow. The water tank was located approximately 200 metres from the house. There was no means of determining how much water was in the tank. When the tank overflowed it was full, when water ceased to flow it was empty. It took more than four hours to fill the tank.  
     
      
    21 Water was supplied to the tank by means of an electric pump. The pump was located in a small tin shed, approximately 4-5 metres above the creek. An inlet pipe ran from the pump into the creek. At the end of the inlet pipe was a non-return foot valve, which was protected by a metal grate. The theory was that water could flow into the pipe but not out. In reality from time to time the valve became blocked with pine needles and other litter in the creek so that it became jammed open. The pump would not properly operate until the obstruction was removed. 
     
      
    22 An outlet pipe went from the pump to the tank. There was no evidence as to the distance between the pump and the tank, but from exhibit 20 (a diagram which was not to scale) the distance appears to have been in excess of 200 metres. There was also no evidence as to the distance between the pump shed and the house. Again, exhibit 20 suggests that the distance was in the order of 400 metres. 
     
      
    23 Each side tendered photographs of the pump shed and the pump. All of those photographs were taken after the plaintiff’s accident on 2 May 2001. Apart from the photographs in exhibit L (the report of Dr Adams), it was not clear when the other photographs relied upon by the plaintiff were taken, except that they were taken before he left the premises at the end of October 2001. For example, a number of photographs of the pump show modifications, which were not there at the time of the accident. It seems to me that the most accurate depiction of the pump at the time of the accident and when the plaintiff and his wife were in occupation of the property, is that shown in exhibits F(4) and F(5). 
     
      
    24 Although it is dangerous to draw conclusions from photographs, particularly when those photographs were taken some time after the events they are meant to depict, it seems to me that some conclusions can be drawn as to the position of the pump shed and the pump in relation to the embankment. Some approximate measurements were made by Dr Adams and exhibit M(1), which shows Kellie holding a bucket next to the pump, provides a reference point as to the dimensions of the pump. For completeness I find that the rock shown in Exhibit M(1) was not present at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    25 With that qualification it seems to me that exhibits M(1) and photographs 4, 5 and 6 in exhibit L provide an accurate depiction of the position of the pump and pump shed in relation to the embankment. The pump was attached to a concrete base and was positioned approximately 1 metre from the edge of the embankment. At the entrance to the pump shed, where one would normally stand to prime the pump, the ground was level but then immediately fell away in a gradual downward slope towards the creek. 
     
      
    26 When the tank was empty it was necessary to walk to the pump shed and to turn on the pump by means of a switch attached to the wall of the pump shed. This would start the pump, which would continue to move water from the creek to the tank until it was turned off. As indicated, the only way the occupants of the house knew that the tank was full was when it commenced to overflow. It was then necessary to walk back to the pump shed and turn off the pump. That was how the water supply system was meant to operate. The pump and pump shed had been in that position for at least 20 years when the plaintiff and his wife commenced occupation. 
     
      
    27 The reality was somewhat different. According to the plaintiff, the pump only operated when the switch was turned on approximately 10% of the time. The evidence of Mr Mitchell, the first defendant, was that the pump operated most of the time when switched on. The evidence of Mr Hinkley, who was a handyman contractor who worked for the defendants, was that the pump operated correctly about one third of the time. 
     
      
    28 I prefer the evidence of Mr Hinkley. After the plaintiff’s accident it was Mr Hinkley who operated the pump so that water could be supplied to the plaintiff and his wife over the next five-six months. There was no reason why he would tell anything other than the truth. I found him to be an impressive witness. 
     
      
    29 It was the plaintiff’s evidence that a full tank would last between two and four days so that it would be necessary to turn on the pump two to three times a week. The evidence of Mr Hinkley was that after the plaintiff’s accident he found it necessary to turn on the pump once or twice a week. Once again I prefer the evidence of Mr Hinkley. 
     
      
    30 If the pump failed to operate correctly when turned on, it was necessary to prime it manually. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he used follow a diagonal path down to the creek from the pump shed and fill up two plastic buckets. It seems to have been common ground that this was a tedious but not dangerous activity. Although there was some controversy about the size of the buckets, they seem to me to be standard 15 litre buckets. The plaintiff would remove a lid from the top of the pump using a spanner, open the valve on the inlet pipe and pour the buckets of water down through the opening at the top of the pump until water spilled out. He would then screw the cap back on and start the pump. He would put his head down to listen at the inlet and outlet pipe to hear the flow of water to ensure that the pump was operating correctly.  
     
      
    31 Mostly the pump would operate correctly the first time it was primed but on occasions it would be necessary to prime it a second time. This was described by Mr Hinkley as “missing the prime”. If the pump still did not operate, it was usually because pine needles or some other obstruction had jammed the valve in the creek. It would then be necessary to go into the creek to clear the obstruction. 
     
      
    32 The plaintiff’s evidence was that no matter how one carried out the priming function, there would always be water on the ground at the feet of the person performing that task. He described the ground at his feet as muddy and slippery when carrying out the priming of the pump. 
     
      
    33 There were two other versions of how the pump could be primed. I disregard the version given by Mr Mitchell since it is clear that the only occasions that he had primed the pump were when he first acquired the property in the early 1980’s. Even using his method there would still be a lot of water on the ground at the feet of the person carrying out the priming. 
     
      
    34 The method used by Mr Hinkley was as follows. He would check to see whether there was water in the inlet pipe by removing a cap on that pipe. If there was water in the inlet pipe, he would simply turn on the pump. If there was no water in the inlet pipe, this meant that the pump would have to be primed. 
     
      
    35 His method of priming was different to that of the plaintiff. He would open the valve on the outlet pipe thereby allowing water which was in that pipe to run back through the pump into the inlet pipe. When the inlet pipe was filled, the valve on the inlet pipe would be closed so that water would then flow into the pump. If there was not sufficient water in the outlet pipe, or the pump missed its prime, it would still be necessary to go down to the creek and fill up buckets of water. Whichever method was used, the priming of the pump was difficult. Mr Hinkley described it as “a mongrel pump to start” (T.258). Nevertheless, none of the suggested methods made it necessary to go to the back of the shed, ie that side of the shed which faced the creek. 
     
      
    36 An issue arose as to whether this method of priming the pump had ever been explained by Mr Hinkley to the plaintiff. Mr Hinkley’s evidence was that he had no recollection of having done so but he thought he must have explained it to the plaintiff, otherwise the plaintiff would not have known how to prime the pump. 
     
      
    37 The plaintiff in his evidence in chief and cross-examination made no mention of Mr Hinkley or anyone else explaining to him how to prime the pump. His evidence was that there was a similar pump on his parents’ property and he had 20 years’ experience in priming such pumps (T.25-26). That evidence was confirmed under cross-examination (T.74-75). 
     
      
    38 After Mr Hinkley had given evidence as to how he primed the pump, the plaintiff was recalled. His evidence on this occasion was that Mr Hinkley had shown him exactly how to prime the pump when he first occupied the premises. He said that he tried to use the technique suggested by Mr Hinkley of using the water in the outlet pipe, but he found that it very rarely worked. When pressed under cross-examination the plaintiff was somewhat vague as to exactly what had been said to him by Mr Hinkley.  
     
      
    39 The importance of this issue in the plaintiff’s case was because of the evidence by the plaintiff that following the priming of the pump, he would always listen to the inlet pipe and outlet pipe to ensure that water was flowing through the pump (T.28). It was the plaintiff’s contention that the activity of placing his ear near to the inlet pipe would force him to stand on the sloping and broken ground next to the inlet pipe. The method suggested by Mr Hinkley did not involve such an activity. 
     
      
    40 I have concluded that although this issue goes to the plaintiff’s credit, it is something of a false issue insofar as liability is concerned. Whichever method was used to prime the pump, I am not convinced that there was ever any need to place one’s ear next to the inlet pipe. If water was flowing through the outlet pipe then as a matter of physics it must have been flowing through the inlet pipe. I am not persuaded that the plaintiff always placed his ear next to the inlet pipe as well as the outlet pipe after priming. 
     
      
    41 On the credit issue I am not satisfied that the plaintiff did receive any instruction from Mr Hinkley as to how to prime the pump. Mr Hinkley had no recollection. It is surprising that if such instruction had been given, the plaintiff made no mention of it either in chief or under cross-examination when a clear opportunity was available to do so. When recalled on this point, the plaintiff’s evidence did not persuade me that Mr Hinkley’s method of priming the pump had ever been explained to him. I formed a clear impression from the plaintiff’s evidence that when he commenced occupation of the premises because of his prior experience on his parents’ property, he considered that he knew how to prime such pumps and did not require or seek any assistance in doing so. 
     
      
    42 The plaintiff was the person who would prime the pump. Kellie had never performed that function. The plaintiff’s evidence was that it was his invariable practice to switch the pump on or prime it during daylight hours. If the pump had to be primed, it was not possible to hold a torch and properly carry out that activity at night. If the tank commenced overflowing at night, he would usually not turn off the pump until the next morning. 
     
      
    43 It was common ground that Mr Mitchell told the plaintiff that if he had any problems, he was to raise them with him or Mr Hinkley and not the real estate agents. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he had spoken to Mr Mitchell about the pump on dozens and dozens of occasions, at least fifty or more. The substance of those complaints was that he had to prime the pump on a frequent basis and the difficulties associated with that task. The plaintiff said that he made the observation to Mr Mitchell that the pump was in a dodgy position. Under cross-examination the following evidence was given: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I want to suggest to you that you made no complaints to Mr Mitchell concerning safety in the operation of this pump. Do you understand the question? 
         
        A. Yeah, I’m thinking. No, I can’t specifically remember saying that, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If you complained to Mr Mitchell it was about the pump being inconvenient to you because of either the way it was set up or because the foot valve was clogging or matters of that kind? 
         
        A. Yeah, yeah. Just complained about having to prime it all the time. I have said it was in a dodgy position to him, though. Because we had both spoken about the bank being eroded and I can remember saying it was in a dodgy position, but I never said it was dangerous. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You never asked him to remove it, did you? 
         
        A. He said it should be moved back. I never said it, but he said it should be moved back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did he say that? 
         
        A. I couldn’t tell you when. That was when we were talking about the bank being eroded away, it had been there so long it should be moved back, but this new pump is going up in the shed, so it doesn’t matter. I can remember that.” (T.86) 
        
       
      
    44 The reference to a new pump in that last answer is a reference to evidence given by the plaintiff that in the course of conversations with Mr Mitchell concerning the pump, Mr Mitchell told the plaintiff that he had another pump in a shed, which was a self priming pump and that he would replace the old pump with it. 
     
      
    45 It was the evidence of Mr Mitchell that the plaintiff had only mentioned the pump once or twice. It seems to me that the true position lies somewhere between the evidence of Mr Mitchell and that of the plaintiff. I have no doubt that the plaintiff did complain to Mr Mitchell on a number of occasions about difficulties which he was experiencing in priming the pump, both as to the need to do so on a frequent basis and because the job itself was difficult. I am equally sure, however, that the number of complaints was considerably less than the fifty or more suggested by the plaintiff. I formed the view that both these witnesses tended to give evidence in such a way as they perceived would favour their case. 
     
      
    46 While I accept that the plaintiff did not in terms ever say to Mr Mitchell that he considered the priming of the pump to be dangerous, I do accept the plaintiff’s evidence that on one occasion he made an observation to Mr Mitchell to the effect that the pump was located in a dodgy position. Mr Mitchell agreed that a remark to this effect had been made: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In addition to having complained about having to prime it, did Mr Butler complain to you that the pump was in a dodgy position? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he ever have a discussion with you about the bank being eroded? 
         
        A. Yes he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the conversation? Who said what? 
         
        A. He thought the bank – he thought the pump was too close to the bank. The reason it was put close to the bank was to give it more of an advantage to pump the water up. The closer to the bank, the better advantage for the water to be pumped up.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say to you? Just break it down into its components if you would. You are there with him. He is saying something to you about the position of the pump house. What is your best recollection about the words he said? 
         
        A. Oh “I think the pump is too close to the bank”.” (T.308) 
        
       
      
    47 It was suggested to Mr Mitchell that he must have understood the remark that the pump was too close to the bank to mean that there was some danger of falling down the embankment. Mr Mitchell denied that this was his understanding. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When Mr Butler said to you something like this, “I think the pump is too close to the bank” did you understand him to be referring to the safety of the pump? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, when he said “too close to the bank” what did you understand him to be suggesting? 
         
        A. I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, what did you think he was suggesting? 
         
        A. I don’t know what he was suggesting. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ask him? 
         
        A. No I didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So when he said to you “I think the pump is too close to the bank” you had no idea what he was on about?  
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did it occur to you that safety might have been one of the factors that he had in mind? 
         
        A. No, because we had never had a problem with the safety, with the … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So his meaning was completely obscure to you? 
         
        A. Yes.” (T.324) 
        
       
      
    48 I do not accept that Mr Mitchell had no idea what the plaintiff meant when he referred to the pump being too close to the bank. The only reasonable interpretation of the comment, in the context in which it was made, was that the plaintiff was concerned to some extent about safety aspects of the pump being so close to the edge of the creek bank. This is despite the fact that the plaintiff did not in terms refer to safety. It is true that the plaintiff may also have had in mind the difficulty of priming the pump when it was in such a position but the use of the word “dodgy”, which I accept was used by the plaintiff, does import some concern for safety. In my opinion Mr Mitchell should have been on notice that the plaintiff had some concerns as to his safety because of the position of the pump. 
     
      
    49 I am not prepared to make a positive finding that the creek bank below the pump had eroded with time, but it seems likely that some erosion would have occurred. When that proposition was put to Mr Mitchell he responded in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now during the course of your occupation of the property has there been any erosion to your observation, any erosion of the creek bank adjacent to the pump house? 
         
        A. Very little. The creek changes. It keeps, all creeks change their stream of line and they could change six months, twelve months. But there’s been no erosion on that side of it. There’s a few she-oaks in front of it which holds the bank up quite well.” (T.303) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. It is true, is it not, that in the 20 year or so period before the Butlers arrived, there had been some erosion of the creek bank immediately closest to the point where you need to prime the pump? 
         
        A. I don’t know about that. It could have been. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t deny that possibility? 
         
        A. It could, yes.” (T.339) 
        
       
       
      That was the only evidence on the subject.  
       
      
    50 It was Mr Mitchell’s evidence that he had never promised the plaintiff that he would replace the existing pump. He agreed that he did have another pump in a shed on his property but that this pump was not self-priming and belonged to the previous owner, a Mrs Blow. Mr Mitchell agreed that he discussed that pump with the plaintiff, but in the context of “it would be nice to get that pump hooked up” (T.304) or “eventually I’ll get a new pump one day” (T.306). He denied that he had ever made any promise or commitment to replace the old pump. 
     
      
    51 In the course of argument it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that Mr Mitchell had deliberately led the plaintiff on by promising to replace the old pump when he had no such intention. I do not accept that as a correct characterisation of what took place. A conversation concerning a replacement pump clearly took place but I do not accept that any firm commitment to do so was made by Mr Mitchell. No motivation has been established for why Mr Mitchell would act in such a deliberately deceitful way. 
     
      
    52 A more accurate characterisation of Mr Mitchell’s approach to complaints about the pump is to be found in the following question and answer: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And what was the nature of his complaint, put it in your own words, what was he saying to you? 
         
        A. He probably complained about the priming, it had to be primed. He would have liked the pump on the place with a pressure that he just had to press a button on the farm. It don’t work that way because you still get the needles in the foot valve and so forth, even if you had that bigger pump on the farm. It still wouldn’t make any difference. You still had to prime the pump.” (T.306) 
        
       
      
    53 I gained the impression that Mr Mitchell regarded the need to prime the pump as a fact of life when living on a rural block. I believe that he was somewhat dismissive of the complaints of the plaintiff concerning difficulties associated with the priming of the pump and did not really turn his mind to the problem. 
     
      
    54 That he should have been aware of the potential risk of injury associated with the priming of the pump had he turned his mind to the question, emerged clearly from this exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In any event, you agree that the footing underneath the person priming the pump would, in the ordinary course, become wet and slippery from time to time? 
         
        A. I agree on that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was apparent to you that there was, when the Butlers came on the scene, at least a potential for someone to slip on that slippery footing? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No chance at all? 
         
        A. There would be a chance of anything, but no chance of that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry could you repeat your answer? 
         
        A. I’d say there would be a chance. It could happen, but nobody – it happened to nobody else that primed the pump. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But it was obvious to you was it not, at the time the Butlers came, that there was a chance that someone could slip while they were priming the pump? 
         
        A. Yes. There could have been a chance. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And a slip so close to the edge of the bank could have severe consequences for that person, couldn’t it? 
         
        A. It could, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you appreciated that the pump house would be much safer in its operation if it was moved a couple of metres away from the bank? 
         
        A. It would have been yes.” (T.377-338) 
        
       
      
    55 The plaintiff has little recollection of what he was doing on the day of the accident. Mr Hinkley was able to say that the plaintiff and his father-in-law were unloading posts on Mr Mitchell’s property at 1pm. The plaintiff’s father-in-law, Mr Bruce, gave evidence that they were still carrying out that activity between 3 and 3.30pm when he left. The plaintiff’s movements between that time and when he was found by his wife at approximately 10 pm are not known except that he must have been lying in the creek bed for some hours before his wife found him. 
     
      
    56 The plaintiff’s evidence on this subject is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As far as the day of the accident is concerned do you have any recollection of going down to, or in the area of the pump? 
         
        A. No. I can remember priming the pump; that is about all I can remember. I can’t remember walking down there. I can’t remember going down to the creek. I can remember priming the pump. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is your last clear recollection before you had your accident? 
         
        A. Leaving work that afternoon, getting home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you recall what time of day that was? 
         
        A. Just after 5 o’clock. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And can you recall what if anything you did at home before you went down to the pump, or close to the pump? 
         
        A. No.” (T.31) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. I want to ask you some questions about the day of the accident. You told us that you don’t remember very much at all. You think you remember coming home from work but you’re not certain of that? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And apart from that, you don’t remember what you did during the day before that time, nor what you did thereafter? 
         
        A. Don’t remember what I did in the day. The only thing I have a clear memory of that day is, my last memory is standing over the pump and also taking my jumper off because it was cold – it was cold so I had a jumper on and I got hot from carrying the buckets of water and I took it off. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re certain in your memory it was that day? 
         
        A. Positive. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were standing over the line did you say? 
         
        A. Over the pump priming it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time of the day was that? 
         
        A. Right on dusk. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But I take it it was still daylight? 
         
        A. It was still daylight. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As you said earlier, you wouldn’t have done that in the dark? 
         
        A. No I would not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time of day would that have been, as best you can now say? 
         
        A. Somewhere from I suppose half past four to six o’clock.” (T.95) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. You have no idea how you came to fall into the creek have you? 
         
        A. No I can’t tell you that either, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it you have tried to remember what happened? 
         
        A. Yes I have lots. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have given doctors various versions of what happened but that, I take it, was not based on any actual memory that you had? 
         
        A. No, the only specific memory that I’ve got is standing over the pump priming it and taking my jumper off down there. They’re my last memories. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Anything you said to doctors about how you came to fall in the creek is only an assumption on your part not based on any actual memory. That’s right, isn’t it? 
         
        A. There would be pictures that came into my head but no, I couldn’t tell you a hundred percent. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have just got no memory of it? 
         
        A. No exact memory but I get pictures in my head but they are different pictures. I can’t say a hundred percent whether that’s what I did. I think over and over it and through it again and again but I won’t say no, this one happened.” (T.98) 
        
       
      
    57 There was evidence from Kellie Butler that when she arrived home at approximately 9.45pm the dogs were loose. The water tank was overflowing. The lights were on in the house and there was a fire lit in the barbeque. That latter observation was confirmed by Mr Hinkley who described a large log which was well alight in the barbeque which was a cut down 44 gallon drum on its side on welded legs. Some rissoles, which Mrs Butler had made the night before, were sitting on the bench and there were some vegetables chopped up prepared to be cooked. Again this latter observation was confirmed by Mr Hinkley whose evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you see on the stove? 
         
        A. Vegetables all ready to eat, still in the pot.” (T.273) 
        
       
      
    58 The evidence of Kellie Butler and Mr Hinkley was that the plaintiff was found in the creek bed almost directly below the pump shed. When Kellie found the plaintiff, the dogs were standing around him. 
     
      
    59 Mrs Butler ran back to the house, telephoned the Hinkleys and then telephoned an ambulance. Mrs Hinkley telephoned the SES. The plaintiff was not responsive to attempts to rouse him. It was necessary for the SES to set up a tripod and pulley system in order to winch the plaintiff from the creek bed so that he could be placed in the ambulance and then taken to hospital. 
     
      
    60 It was submitted by the defendants that at the time of his fall the plaintiff was intoxicated and that this had caused, or contributed to, the fall. The evidence of Mr Hinkley was that when he left the plaintiff and his father-in-law at about 1pm on the day of the accident, they appeared to be drinking beer. He was unable to say how much. Mr Hinkley observed a longneck beer bottle next to the barbeque on the night of the accident and an empty stubby in the pump house when he went to the plaintiff’s assistance. Mrs Hinckley, who was a registered nurse, smelled alcohol on the plaintiff’s breath and noticed bubbles coming from his mouth when he was being removed from the creek bed. 
     
      
    61 On the other hand, the Wollongong Hospital notes indicated a negative result for “alcohol on breath”, and a negative result for alcohol having been consumed in the preceding twelve hours. Counsel for the defendants identified some inaccuracies in the Wollongong Hospital notes. I was asked to infer that there was a strong likelihood that the notes were incorrect when they recorded the absence of alcohol on the plaintiff’s breath on admission. 
     
      
    62 Even taking the evidence referred to by the defendants at its highest, I am not persuaded that alcohol played any part in the plaintiff’s accident. There was no evidence as to whether the beer bottle observed near the barbeque was empty or full, nor that anything had been consumed from it on the night of the accident. There was no evidence that the empty stubby observed in the pump shed had been consumed on the night of the accident. The evidence of Mr Hinkley goes no further than to establish that at approximately 1pm after performing heavy work, the plaintiff and his father-in-law consumed some beer. The evidence of Mrs Hinkley concerning the smell of alcohol on the plaintiff’s breath goes no further than to establish that he had consumed some alcohol, probably beer, before the accident. The observation of bubbles coming from the plaintiff’s mouth is quite neutral. 
     
      
    63 The plaintiff was admitted to the Wollongong Hospital early on 3 May 2001 and discharged on 10 May 2001. The plaintiff was complaining of significant pain in the right hip, cervical spine and low back. He had suffered a head injury. He required large doses of opioids for his pain. On discharge he was suffering from significant pain in his lower back and over the sacro-iliac joint regions. He had retrograde amnesia for the day of the accident and post traumatic amnesia for at least 7 days following. 
     
      
    64 After discharge the plaintiff was able to do very little for himself. He had difficulty in mobilising. He was in considerable pain. Assistance was provided to him by his wife and his mother. The need for substantial assistance in the daily activities of life continued for about six months. Because of his head injury, he lost his driver’s licence. He was no longer able to conduct his business. During that time he received treatment from Dr Rajoram, a general practitioner, Dr Cossetto, an orthopaedic surgeon and Ms Musico, a psychologist from the Illawarra Area Health Service. 
     
      
    65 At the end of October 2001 the plaintiff and his wife left the leased premises and moved to Dubbo. By that time the plaintiff was able to do most things for himself, but still required some assistance. He had regained his driver’s licence in late 2001. In 2002 he enrolled in a course to qualify him as a primary school teacher at the Charles Sturt University. He completed a year of that course, but failed all of the exams. His evidence was that he was unable to understand the concepts in the course, had memory problems and was unable to get his assignments in on time. I will deal with that and the plaintiff’s other health issues more fully when dealing with the question of damages. 
     
      
    66 Before the accident the plaintiff owned approximately 100 acres of land in the Dubbo area. That is where the plaintiff and his wife moved to. They live on the property in a caravan which has an annex. The plaintiff’s wife was working at the time of the accident and continued to work until May 2003. On that date she experienced some form of breakdown and ceased work. She resumed work some four months later on a part-time basis and continues to perform part-time work at the present time. That work requires her to spend four days away from the plaintiff every fortnight in Cobar. 
     
      
    67 The plaintiff has not engaged in any remunerative work since the date of the accident. In 2004 the plaintiff commenced a course in agriculture at the Dubbo Tafe. The course required attendance once per week for four hours. The course started in March and finished at the end of the year. The plaintiff obtained a certificate in agriculture.  
     
      
       
       
       
      Liability 
       
      
    68 Although the plaintiff at all times carried the onus of establishing liability, it is convenient to deal with a preliminary point raised by the defendants. The defendants submitted that because of the absence of evidence as to what caused the plaintiff to fall, it was not possible for the court to find that liability had been established. To do so would involve speculation. For the same reason, it was submitted, the Court could not find that the plaintiff had established that any fault on the part of the defendants was causative of his injury. 
     
      
    69 The defendants submitted that there were scenarios available which offered explanations for the plaintiff’s fall which were not consistent with negligence, but were just as likely to have occurred as the scenario suggested by the plaintiff, ie that he slipped or tripped while performing some function associated with priming the pump. The scenarios suggested were: 
     
      
      (a) The plaintiff was affected by alcohol. 
       
      (b) His dogs knocked him off balance. 
       
      (c) Contrary to his usual practice, he went to the creek in darkness. 
       
      
    70 I have already rejected the submission that the plaintiff was adversely affected by alcohol at the time of the fall. The suggestion that his dogs were in some way involved in the fall is speculative and not supported by any evidence. Those scenarios can be readily dismissed. 
     
      
    71 In relation to the scenario that the plaintiff went to the pump shed when it was dark, the defendants relied upon the plaintiff’s evidence that it was his invariable practice to turn the pump on or prime it during daylight. The defendants submitted that this occurred on the day of the accident and the plaintiff thereafter returned to the old house. He then prepared vegetables, laid out the rissoles, lit the barbecue and for some reason not known, went back to the pump shed during darkness and fell in circumstances which will never be known. 
     
      
    72 It seems to me that this scenario also involves a significant amount of speculation, rather than inferences which can be properly drawn from known facts. The fact that the dogs were still loose does not support this scenario.  
     
      
    73 The plaintiff’s case was put in this way. He was found directly below the pump shed. It can be inferred, therefore, that he was engaged in a pump related activity when he fell. He must have successfully primed the pump at a time more than four hours before his wife discovered him at 10pm, because when she arrived at the house the tank was overflowing. This conformed with the plaintiff’s recollection of standing over the pump at dusk and removing his jumper at that time. The fact that vegetables were in the pot, the barbeque was lit and rissoles were laid out is equally consistent with the plaintiff having performed those tasks before he realised that there was no water as with him having done so after priming the pump. 
     
      
    74 The court was asked to infer that following the actual priming of the pump, something occurred either by way of a trip or a slip, which was directly related to that activity. It was submitted that following the priming of the pump, it was necessary to turn on the pump by means of the switch in the pump shed and to listen at the outlet pipe and possibly the inlet pipe to ensure that water was flowing through the pump. The plaintiff could have tripped or slipped during one of those activities. Alternatively, it was suggested that the plaintiff could have simply tripped or slipped whilst moving away from the pump given the rough and sloping nature of the terrain and the fact that the ground around the pump would inevitably have been wet and slippery. 
     
      
    75 I accept the submission put on behalf of the plaintiff. In my opinion the inferences which the plaintiff suggests should be drawn from the evidence are not only open but seem to represent the most likely sequence of events. Just because the plaintiff cannot describe the actual mechanism of his fall does not mean it is not possible for him to establish his case. I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that his last recollection before his accident was of standing over the pump at about dusk removing his jumper. That evidence together with where the plaintiff was found and the fact that the pump had clearly been primed at some time before 6pm, all support the inference that he either tripped or slipped within a very short period of time after he had successfully primed the pump whilst he was positioned close to the pump and pump shed. 
     
      
    76 On the alternative scenarios, the only one which carries any credibility is that for some unknown reason the plaintiff returned to the area of the pump and pump shed some time after he had primed the pump and that it was darkness and lack of visibility which caused the fall. 
     
      
    77 As indicated, not only is there little evidence to support that scenario but it is contrary to the plaintiff’s evidence that he would not go near the pump or pump shed during darkness. It is also contrary to the evidence of the plaintiff and his wife (which was not challenged) that consistent with that practice, even if the tank commenced overflowing during the night, the plaintiff would not go to the pump shed to turn off the pump until morning. 
     
      
    78 Having accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the plaintiff’s fall occurred very soon after he had carried out the actual priming of the pump whilst he was still positioned in and about the pump, it seems to me that causation is also established. Applying the practical test for causation prescribed by March v E and MA Stramare Pty Ltd (1991) 171 CLR 506 it seems clear that the plaintiff’s fall was due in part to the rough and sloping terrain combined with the wet and slippery ground conditions. It was the priming activity which caused water to flow onto the ground around the pump thereby making it wet and slippery, and it was only the need to prime the pump which caused the plaintiff to be in that location. I find that causation has been established. 
     
      
    79 That does not end the matter. The question of a landlord’s liability to a tenant in tort is a developing area of law. The leading case remains Jones v Bartlett and Another (2000) 205 CLR 166. That case while authoritatively establishing that a landlord does owe a duty of care to a tenant of domestic premises left open, depending upon the facts of each individual case, what the content of that duty of care should be. 
     
      
    80 Sakoua v Williams [2005] NSWCA 405 per Mason P provides a useful summary of the law as it has developed and been interpreted since Jones v Bartlett: 
     
      
       
        
        “3 Jones v Bartlett (2000) 205 CLR 166, [2000] HCA 56 established that the lessor of residential premises owes a duty of care to an incoming tenant (and by extension to the tenant’s visitors). The scope of that duty was not, however, formulated in identical terms by their Honours. 
        
       
       
        
        4 The Court discussed the content of the duty, with respect to the condition of the premises at the inception of the letting. Three justices in the majority favoured a duty expressed in terms of one to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury, leaving the practical content of the duty to be governed by the circumstances of the case (per Gleeson CJ at 184[56]-[58], per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 213[168]-[169]). 
        
       
       
        
        5 Two justices in the majority favoured slightly narrower formulations of the duty, referring to a duty to put and keep the premises in a state of safe repair (per Gaudron J at 192[88]-[93]), or to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury from defects of which the landlord was on notice or of which (by appropriate inspection) the landlord would reasonably become aware (per Kirby J at 240[252]). Callinan J expressed no opinion beyond the tentative statement that if any duty were owed, a matter of which he was far from convinced, he would define it as no more than a duty to provide, at the inception of the tenancy, habitable premises (at 252[289]).  
        
       
       
        
        6 McHugh J dissented, for reasons to which I refer below. 
         
         
        7 It can therefore be seen that, for Kirby and Gaudron JJ, the concept of a dangerous defect was central to the narrower duty of care that they favoured. For Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ the presence of such a defect at the inception of a tenancy was seen as highly relevant to a finding of breach of the more generally expressed duty of care that they favoured. 
        
       
       
        
        8 On my reading, none of the justices in the majority went so far as to take any duty to repair beyond requiring the lessor to address  
        defects 
         of which he or she was aware, or ought to be aware. And each of their Honours defined “defect” in this context to mean something more than a condition capable of causing injury (see Tina Cockburn, “Duty of Care of Landlords of Residential Premises” (2001) 20 U Tas LR 205 esp at 223-6; Sharon Erbacher, “Unsafe leased residential premises: A landlord’s liability in negligence to injured occupants” (2002) 13 ILJ 134). 
         
         
        9 In  
        Ahluwalia v Robinson 
         [2003] NSWCA 175, this Court held (at [23] per Hodgson JA, with whom Sheller JA and Bryson JA agreed): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          Jones v Bartlett 
           makes it clear that, in the absence of a contract supportive of a higher [duty], the duty of a landlord in relation to the safety of premises does not in general require a landlord to commission experts to inspect premises to look for latent defects, nor is it a duty to make premises as safe as reasonable care can make them. In general terms, the duty of the landlord is to be determined by reference to foreseeable risk of harm and what a reasonable person would do in response to that risk.”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    81 Applying those principles to the facts of this case, it was foreseeable that a person might trip or slip so as to fall while priming this pump. It was foreseeable because of the closeness of the pump to the edge of the embankment, the sloping and rough nature of the terrain and the fact that the priming operation would inevitably result in the ground surrounding the pump becoming wet and slippery because of the spillage of water. This fact was acknowledged by Mr Mitchell [54]. 
     
      
    82 It was not just a bare possibility but it seems to me that there was a high likelihood of such a fall occurring. I appreciate that during the twenty years that the defendants had owned the property no such fall had occurred. During that twenty years the premises had been occupied by a long-term tenant for most of the time and for about a year by the persons whose advertisement the plaintiff had seen in the post office. That is not decisive because the situation in relation to the pump and the bank was not static over that period. 
     
      
    83 It is clear from the evidence of Mr Hinkley that this was an old pump and that it required priming more often than it should have, ie two-thirds of the time that it was turned on. There was also the possibility that over that twenty year period the bank of the creek had eroded somewhat thereby reducing the distance between the pump shed and the edge of the bank. 
     
      
    84 Leaving aside those matters, however, the photographs persuade me that even for a person taking proper care for him or herself while priming the pump, there remained a real risk of falling into the creek. The more often the priming task had to be performed, the greater the risk of a fall occurring. There was no issue that this dangerous situation existed at the commencement of the tenancy. 
     
      
    85 The fact that the risk of falling down the embankment was obvious does not assist the defendants. For the house to be habitable, the plaintiff and his wife had to have access to a regular supply of water. This meant that the plaintiff had no choice but to go to the pump shed once or twice a week in order to prime the pump. On each of those occasions there existed a real risk of a fall, even for a person taking care for his or her safety. 
     
      
    86 Although the plaintiff did not in terms make any complaint to Mr Mitchell concerning safety aspects of priming the pump, he did bring to Mr Mitchell’s attention that the pump was in “a dodgy position”. Even if he had not otherwise given consideration to that question, this put Mr Mitchell on notice that there was a potential safety problem when priming the pump. Even if the plaintiff had not raised this issue with Mr Mitchell, a brief visit by him to the pump shed before or at the time that the lease was entered into would have revealed the real risk of injury for a person priming the pump in that location. 
     
      
    87 Mr Mitchell’s response was to do nothing. Was that a reasonable response in the circumstances? Applying the approach in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 one has to assess the reasonableness of Mr Mitchell’s response by reference to the magnitude of the risk, the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which Mr Mitchell might have had. 
     
      
    88 The magnitude of the risk was significant. If a person fell into the creek it was most likely that such a person would suffer serious injuries. As indicated, I am of the opinion that there was quite a high likelihood of such a fall occurring. There seems to have been little expense, difficulty or inconvenience associated with alleviating the risk. 
     
      
    89 In relation to that latter consideration, the only alternative which was costed was moving the pump a couple of metres away from the bank. This was a relatively simple task and the evidence was that it would cost no more than $1,000. Two other alternatives suggested by Dr Adams also seem to be reasonable, although they were not costed, ie the construction of a safety fence next to the pump between the pump and the bank and reconfiguring the shed so that the opening to the pump was on the side opposite to the creek. There were no persuasive reasons offered by Mr Mitchell as to why those alternatives could not be implemented. His excuses concerning the hundred year flood or that the efficiency of the pump might be adversely affected were not persuasive. 
     
      
    90 The pump and its location would not constitute a “defect” in the classic sense in that it operated correctly. The need to frequently prime it, however, brought about a dangerous situation of which the defendants knew or should have known. The location of the pump and the need to regularly prime it were not merely capable of causing injury, but were likely to do so. In that circumstance a reasonable landlord in the position of the defendants was required to take alleviating action. 
     
      
    91 The conclusion which I have reached is that there was a foreseeable risk of injury to a tenant in the position of the plaintiff at the time when the lease was entered into and that reasonable care required that action be taken to alleviate that risk. The simplest response was to move the pump some metres away from the creek bank.  
     
      
    92 The defendants pleaded contributory negligence. The case was, however, run on the basis of negligence or no negligence. Of the matters raised in argument the only basis for any finding of contributory negligence was if the plaintiff suffered his injuries by attempting to prime the pump at night, or if he had been adversely affected by alcohol when attempting to do so. I have rejected both those scenarios. It follows that I find that contributory negligence has not been established by the defendants. 
     
      
       
      Injuries and disabilities 
       
      
    93 I have found it difficult to identify with any precision the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The discharge summary from Wollongong Hospital refers to fractures of the right and left femoral shaft, but no subsequent medical report makes any reference to this. No other fractures were identified by the hospital. I am not satisfied that the plaintiff suffered any fractures in his fall. CT scans arranged by Dr Cossetto in May 2001, showed no bony abnormality or significant ligamentous injury to the right hip and femur and sacro-iliac joint. A cranial, facial, cervical, spinal and abdominal CT scan revealed no significant post traumatic abnormalities. Clearly, however, the plaintiff must have suffered significant musculo ligamentous damage as a result of the fall. He appears to have been in considerable pain while in hospital. 
     
      
    94 Given those findings on x-ray, it is difficult to understand where Dr Gordon who examined the plaintiff on 29 April 2002, obtained his information that the plaintiff had suffered a fractured pelvis, a fractured right femur and a crush fracture of the spine in the fall. This understanding by Dr Gordon would seem to have been based on what he was told by the plaintiff and is incorrect. When the plaintiff consulted Dr Gordon he was complaining of low back pain and pain going into the right leg. The right leg on occasions became numb. Those complaints accord with the plaintiff’s evidence in these proceedings. Dr Gordon found the plaintiff’s symptoms difficult to explain on the basis of a radiculopathy and he wondered whether the plaintiff may have suffered an injury to the lumbo-sacral plexus. 
     
      
    95 Ultimately Dr Gordon was not able to reach a firm diagnosis. He thought the EMG studies suggested a chronic neurogenic disorder of the right leg, involving the L4, L5 and S1 derived fibres associated with the plexus rather than the nerve root level. 
     
      
    96 The diagnoses of Drs Buckley and Jenssen are of little assistance since both these doctors are rehabilitation experts and each was relying upon medical reports of other specialists in reaching their conclusion. 
     
      
    97 Dr Teychenne in his report of 8 May 2005 referred to an MRI scan of the lumbo-sacral spine showing a small right posterior paracentral disc protrusion at the L5/S1 level with a minor mass effect on the proximal right S1 nerve root. The MRI scan also showed some moderate dehydration of the L2/3, L3/4 and L5/S1 discs. A copy of that report was, however, not tendered by anyone in the case. Such findings are equally consistent with disc degeneration as with trauma. 
     
      
    98 Dr Teychenne arranged for a further EMG nerve conduction study to be carried out in relation to the plaintiff’s legs. He was of the opinion that the findings of that examination were consistent with compression of the L4/5 and S1 nerve roots within the lumbar spine. He thought the plaintiff had persisting L4/5 and S1 nerve root damage which was secondary to pathology within the lumbar spine. 
     
      
    99 The plaintiff was seen on behalf of the defendants by Dr Brian Stephenson, an orthopaedic surgeon, in December 2003. Relying upon the discharge summary from the Wollongong Hospital and on the reports of Dr Cossetto, Dr Stephenson was of the opinion that there was little wrong with the plaintiff from an orthopaedic and musculo-skeletal point of view and that by the date of the examination he should have recovered from the physical effects of his fall. 
     
      
    100 The plaintiff was seen by Dr Mellick, a consultant neurologist, on behalf of the defendants on 21 March 2005. Dr Mellick had available to him all of the examinations, including CT scans and MRI scans of his back, EMG test results and bone scan test results. On examination Dr Mellick found no abnormality of gait or of leg or back movements. In particular he noted the plaintiff was able to assume the seated position on the examination couch with hips flexed and knees extended, and appeared in no discomfort in that position. Straight leg raising was, however, limited to less than five degrees on the right and to approximately twenty five degrees on the left. There was no paravertebral muscle spasm. The plaintiff explained the limited spinal movements on the basis that he was fearful of producing pain. 
     
      
    101 Dr Mellick made no specific comment in relation to the MRI scan findings, but said the following in relation to the EMG tests: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the EMG findings reveal evidence of a plexopathy, there is no clinical evidence currently of plexopathy. Accordingly the changes which were noted when that electro physiological test was done in July 2002 might have been of organic origin, however those features are now not associated with any collateral supporting evidence of clinical abnormalities involving the L4, L5 or S1 innervated musculature. Any past nerve fusion in the pelvic plexus should therefore be regarded to have fully resolved.” 
        
       
       
      Dr Mellick concluded that the plaintiff was no longer physically disabled in relation to his back or legs from performing physical work. 
       
      
    102 It seems to me that there is some force in the assessment by Doctors Stephenson and Mellick. Doctor Cassetto could find little objectively wrong with the plaintiff in the months following the accident. The assessments of Dr Gordon and Dr Teychenne depend very much upon EMG testing and bone scans, which at best produce equivocal results. The contrast between the plaintiff’s limited straight leg raise and his ability to sit with hips flexed and knees extended without discomfort when examined by Dr Mellick is rather stark. 
     
      
    103 On the other hand, I gained a distinct impression at the end of the second day of hearing (T.130) that the plaintiff was genuinely in pain and was not doing himself justice when answering questions while under cross-examination. Having said that I also formed the view that some of the plaintiff’s presentation in February after the adjournment, which consisted of frequently getting up and down in court, walking about and wincing in pain were rather histrionic and did not genuinely reflect his physical condition.  
     
      
    104 Another matter which needs to be kept in mind is that the plaintiff did have some pre-existing back problems. Although these did not prevent him from engaging in heavy labouring work up to the time of the accident, it is clear that his back was from time to time symptomatic. It is somewhat doubtful, in my opinion, that the plaintiff would have been able to continue with heavy labouring work to age 65, even had he not been injured. 
     
      
    105 The conclusion which I have reached is that the plaintiff did suffer injuries in the nature of a plexopathy, such as were assessed by Dr Gordon and to a more limited extent, by Dr Mellick. Contrary to the opinion of Dr Mellick, however, I accept that the effects of that plexopathy are continuing and that the plaintiff does continue to suffer low back pain with some effect on his right leg, but not at the level of the intense pain which the plaintiff suggested in his evidence. 
     
      
    106 It follows that I reject the assessment of Dr Teychenne that the plaintiff suffers from compression of the L4/5 and S1 nerve roots. This was a diagnosis rejected by Dr Gordon and it is not consistent with either the CT or MRI scans of the plaintiff’s low back. 
     
      
    107 The plaintiff also complained of erectile dysfunction following the injury. In February 2003 he told Dr O’Neill, a urological surgeon, that he had not had a normal erection since being discharged from hospital. On occasions Viagra worked, but on other occasions it did not. The plaintiff told Dr O’Neill that his main problem was a complete lack of desire. 
     
      
    108 It was the opinion of Dr O’Neill that the cause of the plaintiff’s problem was not organic, but was psychogenic. He recommended consultations with a specialist psychosexual counsellor. That has not occurred. Apart from the report of Dr O’Neill there is no other information on this topic. I have concluded that the plaintiff has suffered some erectile dysfunction and that this is related to the accident. In accordance with the assessment of Dr O’Neill I am of the opinion that this problem has a psychological basis. 
     
      
       
      Did the plaintiff suffer brain injury? 
       
      
    109 The most contentious medical issue was whether or not the plaintiff had suffered brain damage. The plaintiff’s submission was that he suffered from both psychological problems (depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder) and from traumatic brain injury of such severity as to significantly affect his ability to function. Short-term memory loss was a significant feature. 
     
      
    110 On behalf of the defendants, it was submitted that the plaintiff had not suffered brain damage but that matters such as memory loss and lack of anger control were either feigned or psychologically rather than organically based. Reliance was placed upon the neuropsychological reports which indicated that the plaintiff’s performance had deteriorated since the first testing by Ms Musico three months after the accident. This, it was submitted, was inconsistent with an organic brain injury which tended to either remain static or to improve. 
     
      
    111 There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a head injury or that he had suffered a degree of retrograde amnesia in that he could not remember how the accident occurred and what he was doing for some time before his fall. He was unconscious for some hours and experienced two seizures at the accident site. There also seems to have been some post traumatic amnesia, although the exact length is not clear. I am of the opinion that it was in the order of seven days which is the history recorded by doctors who saw him in 2001. The history of twenty one days PTA is one which has developed in later years. His Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was 15 (which is normal). A CT scan of the brain taken at the Wollongong Hospital showed no abnormality. 
     
      
    112 On 7 and 29 August 2001 the plaintiff underwent neuropsychological testing by Ms Musico. The results of those tests indicated that his rate of learning was slow for his age and that his visual memory was below average for immediate recall. His speed of processing information on a number of tasks was also reduced. Otherwise his response appeared to be normal, particularly in relation to immediate auditory memory. Ms Musico thought the plaintiff’s memory functioning was sufficient to enable him to engage in study in 2002, although she recommended that he only do a few subjects in a year while he adjusted to the memory deficit which she found. She thought that further recovery was to be expected. Attached to her report were the test results which the plaintiff achieved at that time. 
     
      
    113 The evidence of the plaintiff’s wife was that following the accident there had been behavioural changes. She identified self-centred behaviour, inflexible thinking and the inability to consider the impact of his behaviour on their relationship. He lost his temper very easily. She also gave evidence of problems with concentration and memory, particularly in relation to the plaintiff losing things. She said that the plaintiff had lost contact with most of his friends. 
     
      
    114 The plaintiff underwent further neuropsychological testing by Ms Alexandra Walker on 17 October 2003. Ms Walker had available to her the test results obtained by Ms Musico in August 2001. Ms Walker noted in relation to intellectual functioning that the plaintiff “surprisingly” performed at a much lower level on a visuospatial problem solving task of putting puzzles together. In relation to attention and information processing, there had been a considerable improvement. In respect of frontal and executive function, his capacities were assessed as generally being intact. The test results for memory were variable and “below expectation”. He showed an apparent decline in the capacity to retain information over time on most of the memory tests that he was given. Ms Walker attributed the reduction in those tests directed at intellectual functioning and memory as due to moderate levels of depression and anxiety which she detected in him. 
     
      
    115 The plaintiff was tested by Dr Arthur Shores, consultant neuropsychologist, at the request of his solicitors on 21 January 2004. Dr Shores carried out a number of tests to assess whether the plaintiff was making a genuine effort to complete the tests. In four out of the five tests administered to him, Dr Shores concluded that the plaintiff was not attempting to do his best. Accordingly Dr Shores thought that he would need to proceed cautiously when interpreting the other neuropsychological tests undertaken by the plaintiff on this occasion. 
     
      
    116 In relation to the initial testing conducted by Ms Musico, Dr Shores was of the opinion that it revealed “only subtle signs of cognitive impairment”. He noted that Ms Musico had found no evidence of mood or anxiety disorder. In contrast the plaintiff had performed very poorly on tests of memory function and had reported extremely severe levels of psychological distress when tested by him. Dr Shores concluded that the plaintiff’s condition appeared to be much worse now than when tested by Ms Musico. Like Ms Walker, Dr Shores was of the opinion that this was most unusual in brain injury patients. He thought the explanation for the poor performance was lack of full effort on the part of the plaintiff, which could be explained by psychological distress. 
     
      
    117 The strongest evidence for the plaintiff having suffered organic brain damage comes from the reports and evidence of Dr Bell, psychiatrist. He saw the plaintiff in March 2004 and April 2005 and gave evidence in the proceedings. The effect of his evidence rose no higher than to establish that the fall was capable of causing organic brain injury. When setting out his reasons for concluding that the plaintiff had suffered brain injury, Dr Bell referred to deficiencies in the early clinical notes and engaged in a process of speculation as to what would have been found had more extensive examinations taken place. He entirely disregarded the neuropsychological test results. In particular he disregarded the extraordinary unanimity in opinion of the neuropsycholigists to the effect that the plaintiff was not doing his best in the tests conducted by Ms Walker, Dr Shores and Dr Roberts. I do not accept the opinion of Dr Bell that the plaintiff sustained severe brain damage. 
     
      
    118 I do, however, accept Dr Bell’s rejection of PTSD as a possible diagnosis of the plaintiff’s psychological problems. An essential ingredient of PTSD is a persistent involuntary recollection of the life threatening or traumatic event. It is a contradiction in terms to offer PTSD as a diagnosis where the particular person has no recollection of the traumatic event. 
     
      
    119 The plaintiff also relied upon a report of Mr Anthony, psychologist, dated 12 July 2005. There are a number of problems with that report. The most obvious is that Mr Anthony was not provided with any of the earlier neuropsychological test results. He was accordingly dependent entirely upon the honesty and accuracy of the plaintiff when undertaking the tests. Also Mr Anthony did not attempt to validate the genuineness of the plaintiff’s effort, as did Dr Shores and Dr Roberts. 
     
      
    120 Doctor Roberts in her report of 17 February 2006 carefully analysed the report of Mr Anthony (report pp 17-22) and identified deficiencies in it of a technical kind insofar as the tests were concerned. Dr Roberts also set out in table form a comparison of the test results obtained by Mr Anthony with those obtained by the other psychologist who had examined the plaintiff, ie Ms Musico, Ms Walker, Dr Shores and herself. I accept the conclusions of Dr Roberts in relation to the report of Mr Anthony and I find the report to be of little assistance. 
     
      
    121 By and large the medical evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants does not support the plaintiff having suffered a brain injury. 
     
      
    122 Doctor Blum, a neurosurgeon, who saw the plaintiff in December 2003 noted that the plaintiff had suffered a concussive head injury and on the basis of his history, thought that he had suffered a moderate degree of brain injury.  
     
      
    123 Doctor Potter, psychiatrist, thought the plaintiff was suffering from an adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety but not brain damage. 
     
      
    124 Doctor Roberts, clinical psychologist, carried out a full range of neuropsychological tests in July 2004. She took a much less charitable view of the results than did Ms Walker and Dr Shores. She was of the opinion that the plaintiff was deliberately seeking to achieve a low result so as to create a false impression as to the level of his disability. Doctor Roberts, who also gave evidence in the proceedings, was of the opinion that the plaintiff had not suffered any cognitive defect and doubted whether there were any genuine memory or concentration problems. 
     
      
    125 Doctor Mellick, a consultant neurologist, also gave evidence in the proceedings. Although he was sceptical as to the conclusiveness of neuropsychological testing as a means of determining the existence of brain damage, he did note that none of the tests (excluding Mr Anthony) pointed to the presence or possibility of “severe brain injury”. The basis for Dr Mellick’s opinion was the absence of any objective signs of brain damage in the plaintiff. To the extent that the plaintiff’s complaints were genuine, Dr Mellick was of the opinion that they could be explained on psychological grounds. 
     
      
    126 The plaintiff’s performance when giving evidence over a number of days did not persuade me that he was suffering from brain damage. I also saw no evidence of memory or concentration difficulties. I did see evidence of some personality problems, particularly relating to anger control. This was evidenced when the plaintiff was being cross-examined. 
     
      
    127 The conclusion I have reached is that if the plaintiff did suffer brain damage as a result of the fall, its effects had largely resolved by the time he saw Ms Musico and had certainly resolved by the time he saw Dr Shores. I do accept that for a number of years following the accident, particularly during 2003 and 2004, the plaintiff experienced significant psychological difficulties, which were directly related to the accident. These manifested themselves in outbursts of temper and the personality difficulties identified by his wife. By the time of the trial, these psychological difficulties had significantly improved. 
     
      
       
      Assessment of damages 
       
      
    128 The calculation of damages is governed by the Civil Liability Act 2002. The plaintiff was born on 6 July 1972 and was therefore 29 when he was injured. It was agreed between the parties that the plaintiff’s life expectancy is 46 years, which under the 5% tables gives a multiplier of 956. As of the date of trial, it was 31.35 years until the plaintiff would turn 65, which under the 5% tables give a multiplier of 838. 
     
      
       
      Non-economic loss 
      
    129 As indicated in the analysis of injuries and disabilities, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has a continuing problem with his low back and right leg in the nature of a plexopathy. In the first couple of years following the accident I accept that the plaintiff did suffer intense pain as a result of this condition. While I do not accept that the plaintiff’s present condition is as severe as he sought to persuade the Court, I do accept that it is continuing and that it will continue for the rest of his life. He is only a young man and pain of that kind even though with the passage of time he will develop strategies to better deal with it remains a very significant detriment which will affect his amenity and enjoyment of life. 
     
      
    130 He has suffered severe psychological trauma, although again I am of the opinion that this had greatly improved as of the date of trial. What I found disturbing in relation to this aspect of the plaintiff’s claim was what I perceived to be an attempt on the part of the plaintiff to exaggerate his disabilities, particularly in relation to memory problems and concentration problems. Nevertheless I am prepared to accept that anyone who has permanently lost his ability to fully engage in physical work is likely to develop anxiety and depression from time to time. 
     
      
    131 Accordingly, taking those matters into account together with my assessment of the medical evidence, I would assess the plaintiff as entitled to damages for non-economic loss by reference to 32% of a most extreme case, ie $124,800.00 
     
      
       
      Out-of-pocket expenses 
       
      Past 
      
    132 This was agreed at $20,979.40. Of that amount, $7,235 was paid by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to interest on the amount which he has paid. The parties agreed that the relevant interest rate under the Act was 5.91%. Applying that interest rate to the unpaid out-of-pocket expenses for 4.75 years, an amount of $2,031 is produced. 
     
      
       
      Future 
      
    133 The plaintiff claimed medication at a cost of $40 per week. This medication comprised Epilim to prevent seizures, Trammell or some other powerful analgesic such as Endone and Endep, Tryptanol or some similar medication for his psychological difficulties and Panadeine Forte. In view of my findings as to the plaintiff’s disabilities, I do not consider that level of analgesia to be reasonably necessary and certainly not for the rest of the plaintiff’s life. He does not seem to have had a seizure since the date of the accident and I would expect the Epilim to cease in due course. He will no doubt require some form of analgesic support, but not at the level he is said to be currently using it. He may need Tryptanol or some similar substance from time to time in the future, but not on a regular basis. Taking those matters into account, it seems to me that a figure of $20 per week is appropriate, ie $19,120. 
     
      
    134 The plaintiff claims for general practitioner review six times per year at $40 per visit for the next 46 years. There was no evidence from the plaintiff as to how often he currently sees a general practitioner. It can be inferred that it would have to be at least once every two months to obtain prescriptions for his medication. I have already found that his consumption of medication is likely to reduce in the future. Taking that into account and also my assessment of the plaintiff’s level of disability, it seems to me that over the next 46 years an average of four consultations per year rather than six is reasonable, ie $2,942. 
     
      
    135 The plaintiff claimed for counselling at $172 per month. The basis for this claim was the recommendation by Dr Jenssen in his report of 15 May 2003. What Dr Jenssen actually said was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not sure how long he would require these counselling sessions but given his current psychological stresses perhaps for the next year or so he would benefit from regular counselling at least monthly.” 
        
       
       
      I propose to allow the plaintiff two years of counselling, ie $4,000. 
       
      
    136 The plaintiff has claimed for twelve sessions of physiotherapy per year at $60 per session. This was also based on the recommendations of Dr Jenssen in his report of May 2003. In view of my assessment of the plaintiff’s level of disability, it seems to me that twelve sessions per year is excessive, but I do accept that he may well suffer periods of exacerbation of his back pain in the future, which will require physiotherapy from time to time. It seems to me that six sessions per year for the next 46 years would adequately cover that eventuality, ie $6,618. 
     
      
    137 A claim was made for $5,000 for pain management. This was based on the assessment of Dr Buckley in May 2004. To date the plaintiff does not appear to have gained any benefit from the use of pain management techniques. Nevertheless, pain does seem to be a problem for him despite what I perceive to be some exaggeration in his presentation. Accordingly I propose to allow the two attendances provided for by Dr Buckley, ie an initial attendance cost of $950 and a subsequent review cost of $536, a total of $1,486. 
     
      
    138 The plaintiff’s claim for access to heated swimming facilities by way of membership of a gym plus travel expenses of $200 per year was accepted by the defendants as reasonable. Accordingly I include in the plaintiff’s damages an amount of $14,340 to cover that claim. 
     
      
    139 In summary I award in favour of the plaintiff the following amounts in respect of future out-of-pockets:

      Domestic Assistance 
       
      
    140 There is no claim for any paid care in relation to the past. The plaintiff’s claim was for 20 hours of unpaid assistance per week for the past. Reliance was placed upon the evidence of the plaintiff, his wife and his mother. The entitlement to damages for such services is covered by s15 of the Act, which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “15(1) In this section “attendant care services” means any of the following: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) services of a domestic nature,  
         
        (b) services relating to nursing, 
         
        (c) services that aim to alleviate the consequences of an injury. 
        
       
       
        
        “Gratuitous attendant care services” means attendant care services: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that have been or are to be provided by another person to a claimant, and  
         
        (b) for which the claimant has not paid or is not liable to pay. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) No damages may be awarded to a claimant for gratuitous attendant care services unless the court is satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) There is (or was) a reasonable need for the services to be provided, and

        (c) the services would not be (or would not have been) provided to the claimant but for the injury. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Further, no damages may be awarded to a claimant for gratuitous attendant care services, if the services are provided or are to be provided: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) for less than 6 hours per week and 
         
        (b) for less than 6 months. 
         
        …” 
        
       
      
    141 According to the Wollongong Hospital notes the plaintiff was ambulant when he was discharged on 10 May 2001. The hospital notes also suggest that he was able to carry out a number of basic self-care tasks for himself. Nevertheless I am satisfied by the evidence of the plaintiff’s mother and his wife, that he did require a significant amount of assistance in the first six months after his discharge from hospital. It seems to me 20 hours per week is reasonable for that period. I am not satisfied, however, that following that six months period he continued to require that level of assistance. That does not accord with contemporary medical material and does not accord with the nature of the injury suffered by the plaintiff. I do, however, accept that he would still have required some assistance and I assess that at 10 hours per week for a further six months. Thereafter I am not persuaded that there was a reasonable need for attendant care services to be provided to the plaintiff at a level of 6 hours or more per week. During that period until May 2003 the plaintiff’s wife continued to work. In late 2003 she again resumed work and spends four days away from home during which time the plaintiff appears to be able to adequately look after himself. I am satisfied from his presentation in court and from the medical material that he is fully able to look after himself. I am satisfied that if he were on his own, he could adequately perform housework, cooking and basic household repairs which did not require repetitive bending or heavy lifting. 
     
      
    142 In view of the findings which I have made in relation to loss of earning capacity, both past and future, there would be adequate time available to the plaintiff to perform whatever domestic tasks were necessary for him even allowing for the fact that he might have to perform those tasks more slowly because of his disability. To the extent that he has received attendant care services in the past, I find that any such services at the level of 6 hours or more per week after the initial 12 months were not reasonably necessary. 
     
      
    143 Accordingly I award in favour of the plaintiff $14,103 for past gratuitous attendant care services. The hourly rate which I have used is $18.08. 
     
      
    144 The plaintiff claimed 20 hours per week for future attendant care services. It follows from the above analysis that this claim is rejected. As indicated, to the extent that the plaintiff does require attendant care services in the future, I am of the opinion that this need will not amount to 6 hours or more per week. This includes any need for handyman services and the like. 
     
      
       
      Economic loss 
      
     Past economic loss145 It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that uninjured the plaintiff would have been earning at the rate of $800-$1100 per week on the basis that his business was profitable and growing. If the Court were not prepared to accept that proposition, it was submitted that the Court should use average weekly earnings as the reference point for what the plaintiff would have earned uninjured. It was submitted that the plaintiff was totally incapacitated for all work for which he was suited. 
     
      
    146 When formulating economic loss one needs to have regard to two considerations. The first is the extent to which a plaintiff’s capacity to work has been reduced. The second is what use the plaintiff would have made of that capacity had he or she not been injured. Put another way, one has to have regard to what the plaintiff would have earned uninjured (Husher v Husher (1999) 197 CLR 138 at [6]-[8]. What the plaintiff did in the past will usually provide important guidance as to the plaintiff’s earning capacity and what economic capacities will probably flow from damage to that capacity. 
     
      
    147 The only time the plaintiff was making consistently high earnings was when he was employed by the Navy in the submarine service. Both before and after he joined the Navy he engaged in labouring tasks which of their nature are not particularly remunerative. Although the plaintiff’s business was reasonably successful, it could not be said that at the time when he was injured, he was making large sums of money. 
     
      
    148 The defendants tendered (exhibit 23) a report dated 6 December 2005 from Messrs Crispin and Jeffery, chartered accountants. That report analysed the earnings of the plaintiff’s business since he commenced it in early 2000. I was also provided with some profit and loss accounts prepared by the plaintiff’s wife in relation to the business. For the financial year that the plaintiff was operating his business until he was injured, he had a gross income of $25,400 before expenses and $13,653 after expenses. The profit and loss accounts indicated that work was increasing in the months leading up to the accident. The plaintiff’s gross earnings, after the deduction of expenses but before taxation in that period, were $315 per week and after taxation, $282 per week. 
     
      
    149 It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that because the amount of work which he was performing was increasing, that the Court should infer that had the plaintiff not been injured, the business would have increased to the level suggested in submissions or to a level which would have brought to the plaintiff average weekly earnings, ie between $861 and $1000 per week for the period 2001 – 2006. No basis for this submission was established other than the fact that the amount of work being performed by the plaintiff was increasing in the months leading up to the accident, that the plaintiff had shown he was a hard worker and that average weekly earnings would provide a proper guide for what he would have earned uninjured. 
     
      
    150 No evidence was called as to the availability of work in this area. It seems to me that performing contract labouring work in a rural area such as the Kangaroo Valley, is not a unique undertaking and that there would be competition from other sources. There is, of course a finite limit to the amount of work which one person can perform. Had the plaintiff sought to expand his business and employ other persons, other considerations apply which have both positive and negative features when calculating likely income. Other than the plaintiff’s actual earnings from the business, his case on economic loss was imprecise and vague. 
     
      
    151 There is another consideration. It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff did not like working in the city and preferred a rural lifestyle. This was not only because of the nature of the life, but because he loved his dogs and he loved hunting with them. This was an activity which could not be performed in the city. It seems to me that the plaintiff had made a clear lifestyle choice when choosing to leave the city and live in a rural area. The downside of such a choice is that work is not as plentiful, nor is it as well paid in such rural areas.  
     
      
    152 I do not accept the submission made on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff’s economic loss, both past and future, ought be calculated only by reference to the actual earnings of the business in the brief period that it was operating. I am satisfied from the increased work which the plaintiff was performing in the months leading up to the accident that the business would have expanded beyond what it was earning at that time. I am not prepared to find that the business would have been so successful as to enable the plaintiff to earn somewhere between $800 and $1100 after expenses. It seems to me that uninjured the plaintiff’s business may well have reached a stage where he was earning $600 per week after expenses, ie that it would have been twice as successful as it was at the time when he was injured. After tax the earnings of the business would have been $490 per week. I find that uninjured the plaintiff would have reached a stage when he was earning $490 net per week from his business. 
     
      
    153 The next question is the extent to which the plaintiff’s capacity to work has been damaged. As indicated the plaintiff’s case was that he was totally incapacitated for all work. The defendants submitted that the plaintiff was not totally incapacitated, but that he could do clerical work and in particular could do work involving a computer.  
     
      
    154 In relation to that latter submission, the defendants relied upon the evidence of Mr Rowe, an investigator who had interviewed the plaintiff in February 2002. Mr Rowe’s evidence was that when the plaintiff was asked how he spent his day, the plaintiff told him that he watched videos and that he spent approximately 2 hours per day on the computer, mostly on the internet.  
     
      
    155 This conversation was denied by the plaintiff. He asserted that he spent very little time using a computer and was not able to spend as long as 2 hours in such an activity. It would cause him too much pain to do so. 
     
      
    156 I found Mr Rowe a convincing and believable witness and I do not accept the plaintiff when he says that such a conversation did not take place. Having found that such a conversation took place, I also accept that the plaintiff is capable of spending at least 2 hours per day working on a computer. 
     
      
    157 Even though I have found that the plaintiff does have some computer skills, and that his back and right leg disabilities are not as great as he would have the Court believe, this does not mean that the plaintiff is necessarily employable on the open labour market. I accept that the plaintiff does have a level of continuing pain in relation to his low back and right leg. I am satisfied that his disability is such that he will never again be able to engage in heavy labouring work and work involving bending and lifting and work which will place a strain upon his low back and sacroiliac area. 
     
      
    158 This in effect disqualifies the plaintiff from most work in a rural area, which is his lifestyle of choice. The very limited nature of the work suggested by the Vocational Capacity Centre in its report of July 2005 confirms that. The sort of employments identified as being within the plaintiff’s capacity were voluntary clerical, product grader, industrial spray painter, betting agency counter clerk and service station attendant. 
     
      
    159 The plaintiff was very definite in his evidence that he disliked inside work, was not qualified to perform clerical work and would be very unhappy to do so. He also opined that if he were performing such work he would need to get up and down on a frequent basis and may need to rest if his back became stiff. I do not think that clerical work of any kind would be a suitable employment opinion for the plaintiff even if he could perform it on a fulltime basis, which I doubt. 
     
      
    160 The plaintiff has his driver’s licence and has been driving since the end of 2001. He still walks his dogs. I believe he is capable of light maintenance work about the house. He does have some computer skills. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that even though the plaintiff is not fit for fulltime work on the open labour market in rural areas such as Dubbo, he would be fit from time to time to perform some work but only on a part-time basis. Fulltime work will, however, be permanently beyond his abilities. 
     
      
    161 As indicated by the medical material, and my findings in relation to the plaintiff’s back injury, his recovery was gradual until it reached the state which I have described above. It is difficult to determine when it could be said that the plaintiff had a residual earning capacity. Doing the best I can, I find that the plaintiff’s back condition had stabilised so that he had a residual earning capacity as of January 2004. I assess that residual earning capacity from 1 January 2004 at $100 net per week. 
     
      
    162 In relation to the plaintiff’s earnings uninjured, it would have taken the plaintiff’s business some time to build up to a level which would have enabled him to earn from it $490 net per week. Although this is of necessity somewhat arbitrary, I would assess the plaintiff’s earnings from his business if he had not been injured as follows: 
     
      
       
      Remainder of 2001 - $300 net per week. 
       
      2002 - $350 net per week. 
       
      2003 - $400 net per week. 
       
      2004 and following $490 net per week. 
       
      
    163 On the basis of those findings I assess the plaintiff’s past economic loss at $94,740. Interest on past economic loss is $11,899.00. 
     
      
       
      Future loss of earning capacity 
      
    164 In terms of s13 of the Civil Liability Act I find that uninjured the plaintiff would have continued his farm-labouring business and that the business would have been sufficiently successful so as to enable the plaintiff to earn from it approximately double the amount which he was earning at the time that he was injured, ie $490 net per week. I find that the likelihood of that occurring was extremely high and with one exception I do not propose to apply any further discount in relation to it other than the conventional discount for vicissitudes of 15%. 
     
      
    165 As indicated, in relation to the plaintiff’s residual earning capacity, I find that in the future he would be able to earn from part time work an amount which would average $100 per week. It follows that I find that he has suffered a continuing economic loss for the future of $390 net per week.  
     
      
    166 I have referred to the question of vicissitudes in the context of s13 of the Civil Liability Act. I have to also have regard to the question of vicissitudes when considering the effect of the plaintiff’s pre-existing back injury. 
     
      
    167 I have found that the plaintiff did suffer from a pre-existing pain injury which caused him pain from time to time and caused him to wear a back brace. The injury was not sufficiently severe to prevent him from performing heavy labouring work on a consistent basis up to the date of his injury. The fact that he had been experiencing symptoms in relation to his back since before he left the Navy, albeit on an intermittent basis up to the time of the accident, persuades me that it would have been most unlikely that the plaintiff would have been able to perform heavy labouring work of the type which his business required up to age 65. Accordingly I propose to increase the level of vicissitudes from 15% to 20% to have regard to the real chance that the plaintiff’s back problems would have forced him to give up labouring work in his business before age 65. 
     
      
    168 Accordingly, I calculate the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for future loss of earning capacity to be $261,456, ie $390 per week for 31.35 years less 20% for vicissitudes. 
     
      
    169 The plaintiff’s claim included an amount for loss of superannuation benefits. This was put on two bases. The first was that some allowance should be made for a loss of superannuation in order to have regard to the possibility that the plaintiff may have ceased being self-employed and decided to work for someone else. I do not accept that argument. The plaintiff’s case on economic loss was put on the basis that uninjured he would have been self-employed. No specific employment scenario was suggested other than an alternate claim for economic loss based on average weekly earnings. 
     
      
    170 The second basis was that as a self-employed person, it was open to the plaintiff to so structure his affairs by setting up his own superannuation fund that he could gain a taxation benefit. It was submitted that allowance should be made under the heading of “superannuation loss” for this lost benefit.  
     
      
    171 There are a number of problems with this submission. The first is that it indirectly involves a claim for the loss of investment opportunities relating to his private superannuation fund. There was no expert or other evidence as to how such a fund would be set up and how much would be paid from the plaintiff’s weekly income towards it. Finally, the plaintiff has had the whole of his weekly income brought to account in the calculation of future loss of earning capacity. If some allowance were to be made for superannuation as a self-employed person, the claim for future loss of earning capacity would have to be reduced by the amount to be deducted weekly as a contribution to his private superannuation fund. Accordingly, apart from the problem created by the absence of evidence, the submission involves double counting. The claim for loss of superannuation is rejected. 
     
      
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    172 My assessment of the plaintiff entitlement to damages is as follows:

    173 No submissions were made to me as to costs. Accordingly, I propose to reserve that question and give to the parties liberty to apply if any special costs orders are sought. 
     
      
    174 The orders which I make are:

      2005/1092 REGINA v John HOHAIA 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 1] - Application by Mostafa Abdulkader under s108(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: During the course of a trial for murder, application was made on behalf of Mostafa Abdulkader, one of the accused, for leave under s108(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") to tender a statement of a witness, Robert Dibb. After argument, I made a ruling, refusing leave. I stated that I would give my reasons later. I now set out those reasons. 
     
      
       
      The Trial. 
       
      
    2 Mostafa Abdulkader and John Hohaia were jointly indicted for the murder of Alexander Szirt at Belmore on 3 December 2003. On the evening of 2 December 2003 at about 10.30 pm, Alexander Szirt went to premises known as 52 Lucerne Street, Lakemba, the home of John Hohaia's mother. At some time after 1.35 am the following morning, 3 December 2003, he was brutally assaulted. He was then bundled into the back seat of the vehicle which he had driven to 52 Lucerne Street, either unconscious or already dead. The vehicle was then driven by one or other of the accused to Wiley Park. It was observed at Wiley Park at 5.15 am. Mr Szirt's body was ultimately discovered by passers-by at about 3.00 pm. The police were called and an investigation into his murder began. 
     
      
    3 The issue arose after the Crown had completed its case. Before the trial began, notice was given on behalf of Mr Abdulkader that he would rely upon an alibi (Exhibit U). Mr Abdulkader gave evidence in which he raised alibi. He acknowledged that he had been at 52 Lucerne Street on the evening of 2 December 2003 and had been introduced to Alexander Szirt. However, he said he left the premises at approximately 12.15 am, before any violence. He then walked to Haldon Street Lakemba where he worked in Moussa's Bakery. He began work at 1.10 am. On his way to work he saw a friend, Robert Dibb, at about 1.00 am. Mr Dibb was driving a vehicle in Haldon Street, Lakemba. Mr Dibb stopped the vehicle and they spoke. Indeed, he was offered a lift to work. However, he declined that offer, saying that the bakery was only a short distance away. 
     
      
    4 The deceased was certainly alive at 1.35 am. His father, Mr Bella Szirt, telephoned him at approximately that time on his mobile phone. There is also credible evidence that the deceased was alive at 3.30 am and relatively unharmed. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence of Robert Dibb. 
       
      
    5 Robert Dibb has given evidence that he was at home on the evening of Tuesday 2 December 2003. He decided at about midnight to get something to eat. He then drove to a 7/11 store in Canterbury Road, taking a direct route. He made his purchase, which he then ate in the carpark. Some time between 12.30 am and 1.00 am he began the journey home. He chose a different route for no particular reason. His return journey took him down Haldon Street, Lakemba, past Moussa's Bakery. He saw Mr Abdulkader walking towards the bakery in Haldon Street. He stopped and talked. Mr Abdulkader gave the appearance of someone who had been drinking. He said that he had been at a party. They chatted for a time before Mr Dibb drove off. 
     
      
    6 The Alibi Notice nominated Mr Dibb as a witness. Having been served with the notice, the police endeavoured to interview Mr Dibb. He declined their request. When cross examined by the Crown, Mr Dibb was asked the following: (T 845/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Why didn't you want to speak to the police? 
         
        A. Because I already made a statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You hadn't made a statement to the police? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They didn't know what was in your statement? 
         
        A. I don't know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You think by giving them a copy of your statement, they might have been able to check what was recorded in your statement to verify to see if it was true or not? 
         
        A. I don't know."" 
        
       
      
    7 Mr Dibb said the statement had been made to a solicitor on 29 July 2004 (T 842). The Crown did not call for the statement. Nor did it enquire whether Mr Dibb had used the statement for the purposes of refreshing his memory, and thereby seek access to it. There was therefore no cross examination on the statement. 
     
      
    8 In the course of his evidence, Mr Dibb described the circumstances in which he became aware of the arrest of Mr Abdulkader. He said this: (T 841) 
     
      
       
        
        ""SCRAGG: Q. Did you become aware that Mostafa Abdulkader had been charged in connection with the death of Alex Szirt or he had been charged in relation to the death of a person; did you become aware of that? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you become aware of that? 
         
        A. Roughly about a week later. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A week after what? 
         
        A. After I had seen him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember how you became aware of that? 
         
        A. Yes, I read it in The Torch."" 
        
       
      
    9 The Torch is a newspaper which circulates in the Lakemba area, which is published weekly on a Wednesday. Alexander Szirt died in the early hours of Wednesday 3 December 2003. Mr Abdulkader was arrested on the late afternoon of Wednesday 10 December 2003. It follows, as Mr Dibb acknowledged, that the edition reporting the arrest of Mr Abdulkader must have been published on Wednesday 17 December 2003. 
     
      
    10 The Crown, in these circumstances, sought to understand, first, how Mr Dibb was able to say on 17 December 2003 that he had seen Mr Abdulkader on Wednesday 3 December, and secondly, how he knew that the sighting of Mr Abdulkader, whenever it took place, was at a time relevant to the charge against Mr Abdulkader, that is, the time that the deceased had been assaulted and died. In other words, how did he know when Alexander Szirt had died? 
     
      
    11 As to the first issue, Mr Dibb said he just remembered (T 851). He was not working at the time. He was living with his parents. He was asked: (T 851/2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. How did you fill your time in? 
         
        A. Just normal stuff. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What distinguished one day to the next in your life in December 2003? 
         
        A. What do you mean, as in December 2003? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you doing; how did you spend your time? 
         
        A. At home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What would you do at home? 
         
        A. Sit on the computer, sit around the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Watch TV? 
         
        A. Watch TV. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have friends over? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Go to friend's places? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. This would not have been the first time that you had been to the Seven-Eleven store? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    12 When pressed further by the Crown (T 853) how he was able to fix Wednesday 3 December as the day he saw the accused, Mr Dibb simply said he ""knew, he remembered"" that day because the date appeared on his computer screen (T 853). 
     
      
    13 Passing to the second issue (how did Mr Dibb know when Alexander Szirt was assaulted and had died?), the Crown put the following questions to Mr Dibb in cross examination: (T 863/4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did somebody tell you it was Wednesday 3 December that it was alleged that he was at a house where the deceased had died? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did the solicitor ever explain that to you? 
         
        A. No he didn't. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you couldn't possibly be mistaken you say? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you regard yourself as a close friend of the accused, do you? 
         
        A. Just to say hello to him, just to see him occasionally. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Friends of his father? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did his father ever pay you any expenses to go to the solicitor? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. None at all? 
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
       
      The Applicant's Submission. 
       
      
    14 Upon the basis of this material, the applicant sought leave under s108(3) of the Act to tender the statement made by Mr Dibb to the solicitor on 29 June 2004. The statement began with these words (MFI 33): 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. On Wednesday 3 December 2003, at approximately 12.00 midnight I was at my house at 53 Barremma Road, Lakemba."" 
        
       
      
    15 The remainder of the statement simply described, in terms similar to Mr Dibb's evidence, his visit to the 7/11 restaurant at midnight, the journey to Haldon Street, Lakemba, the sighting of Mr Abdulkader and their conversation. 
     
      
    16 Mr Scragg of counsel for Mr Abdulkader relied upon s108(3)(b). It is convenient to set out the entire section which is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s108(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) (Repealed).  
        
       
       
        
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
        
       
       
        
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement."" 
        
       
      
    17 Since leave is required, s192 is also relevant and is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s192(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
        
       
       
        
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
        
       
       
        
         (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
        
       
       
        
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."" 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Scragg acknowledged that the Crown had not suggested fabrication. The Crown had, or would, in final address, suggest that Mr Dibb had either identified the date (3 December 2003) as a result of suggestion, or that his evidence was the product of reconstruction. 
     
      
    19 The words of s108(3)(b) are very broad, extending beyond the questions asked of the witness, to implications arising from such questions. Here it was not put, in terms, that the recollection of Mr Dibb was either the result of suggestion or the product of reconstruction. Nonetheless, that is the implication. The Crown will undoubtedly ask the jury to infer mistake by Mr Dibb, either as the result of suggestion or reconstruction. The words of s108(3)(b) are therefore satisfied. The issue arises whether leave should be given. 
     
      
    20 In Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ identified two important issues in the exercise of the discretion under s108(3). Their Honours' said this: (para [8]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[8] In exercising the discretion under s108(3) to permit the adducing of evidence of a prior consistent statement, it is important to bear two matters in mind. First, s108 creates an exception to the 'credibility rule' - the rule that evidence that is relevant  
        only 
         to a witness's credibility is not admissible (s102). Second, it is important to identify how the evidence relates to the statutory premise for its admission. Whether, if admissible, the complaint becomes evidence of the truth of what is asserted is not relevant to the exercise of the discretion to give leave under s108. The exercise of the discretion under s108 depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication."" 
         
        (emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
    21 Dealing with the first issue, Howie J made the following observations in DBG  (2002) 133 A Crim R 227: (at 241) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... Further the evidence is not being admitted in order to show consistent conduct on the part of the complainant following the incident alleged in the complaint but rather to restore the complainant's credit that has been impugned either by proof that the witness has made a statement inconsistent with the evidence now being given or an allegation that the evidence that is being given is a fabrication, reconstruction or the result of suggestion."" 
        
       
      
    22 The second issue in Graham concerns the importance of identifying the statutory basis for admission and the capacity of the material to address that issue. Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ dealt with that issue, in the context of the case before them, as follows: (para [9]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[9] How does the making of a complaint six years after the events bear upon that question? Unless the making of the complaint can be said to assist the resolution of that question, the evidence of complaint is not important (cf s192(2)(c)) and would do nothing except add to the length of the hearing (cf s192(2)(a)). And in this case, it is by no means clear that the making of a complaint six years after the event does assist in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her evidence. Although trial counsel for the appellant suggested to the complainant, by his last question in cross examination, that she was 'making it all up' the allegation of fabrication of evidence did not loom large in the trial. No question was put, and no answer was given, from which the time of alleged fabrication could be identified. The complaint having been made in 1994, and it having led at once to the start of police investigations, it may be doubted that a jury could gain assistance from its making in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her story."" 
        
       
      
    23 Hunt CJ at CL spoke of the same issue in BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 in these words: (at 141) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... However, the ability of the prior consistent statement to answer the suggestion must remain a matter to be considered in determining whether leave is to be granted."" 
        
       
      
    24 Here, the implication arising from cross examination was that Mr Dibb's description of having seen Mr Abdudlkader on Wednesday 3 December 2003 between 12.30 and 1.00 am was the result of suggestion or reconstruction. How does the making of a statement seven months after the event, in terms which simply repeat the assertion that he saw Mostafa Abdulkader on Wednesday 3 December 2003, assist in determining whether his evidence was the product of reconstruction or suggestion? In my view it does not. The other material in the statement (that is, apart from the date in paragraph 1) was not the subject of challenge or serious challenge by the Crown, such as to raise an issue of credibility concerning Mr Dibb. As to the date, the statement does not add to the evidence given by Mr Dibb himself. It does not enlarge upon his thought processes as to how he knew, some weeks after the event, that the date he had seen Mr Abdulkader was Wednesday 3 December 2003, or how he appreciated that his sighting of Mr Abdulkader was relevant to the charge which he faced (which involved an appreciation of the timing of the assault causing death). The statement does no more than the jury would infer having heard Mr Dibb's evidence, namely, that he had told the solicitor on 29 July 2004 that he saw Mostafa Abdulkader on Wednesday 3 December 2003 between 12.30 and 1.00 am. I doubt whether the jury would get any assistance from the statement in determining whether in fact Mr Dibb had arrived at the date by a process of reconstruction or suggestion. 
     
      
    25 Addressing the issues under s192(2), the evidence, were it admitted, may lengthen the hearing, although not by much. The Crown has foreshadowed that, were leave given and the statement admitted, it may seek leave to further cross examine Mr Dibb upon that statement (s192(2)(a)). No particular unfairness attaches to either party (s192(2)(b)). For the same reasons as given in Graham, that is, because the statement really does not address the credibility attack, nor assist in resolving the issue of reconstruction or suggestion, I do not regard the evidence as important (s192(2)(c)). The evidence, of course, is tendered in the course of a murder trial (s192(2)(d)). Section 192(2)(e) does not arise. 
     
      
    26 For these reasons I refused leave to tender the statement of Mr Dibb in re-examination.

    1 JAMES J: At a trial held in the District Court before his Honour Judge Phelan and a jury the appellant was found guilty of nine charges of aggravated indecent assault (counts 1-7, 9 and 11 in the indictment) and three charges of inciting a person above the age of sixteen years to commit an act of indecency (counts 8, 10 and 12 in the indictment). The only other charges in the indictment were alternative charges of less serious offences to some of the charges of aggravated indecent assault and, having regard to the jury’s verdicts of guilty on all of the charges of aggravated indecent assault, no verdicts were taken on the alternative charges. 
     
      
    2 The complainant on all of the charges was a male person born on 28 August 1978, who I will refer to simply as “the complainant”. It was alleged by the Crown that the offences charged had been committed at various times between October 1993 and December 1996. 
     
      
    3 Judge Phelan sentenced the appellant on count 1 to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year commencing on 1 November 2004, the date on which the jury returned their verdicts of guilty and the appellant, who had previously been on bail, was taken into custody; on each of counts 8, 10 and 12 to imprisonment for a fixed term of one year commencing on 1 November 2005; and on each of counts 2-7, 9 and 11 to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 1 November 2005 with a balance of term of two years. The total effective sentence was, accordingly, a total period of imprisonment of six years, with non-parole periods totalling four years. 
     
      
    4 In the event of his appeal against conviction being dismissed, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by Judge Phelan. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case at the Trial 
       
      
    5 The principal Crown witness was the complainant and I will briefly summarise some of the complaint’s evidence. 
     
      
    6 The complainant was born on 28 August 1978.  
     
      
    7 As a child the complainant lived very close to a golf course, which I will refer to simply as “the golf course”. The complainant’s father introduced him to playing golf when the complainant was only eight or nine years old. 
     
      
    8 The complainant first met the appellant, who was the professional golfer at the golf course, when he was about ten years old. The complainant participated in golf clinics for children run by the appellant. 
     
      
    9 When the complainant turned twelve, he became a junior member of the golf club at the golf course. From then on he would often play some holes on the golf course with the appellant, in the afternoon or evening after the complainant had finished school. 
     
      
    10 One evening on the golf course, when the complainant was thirteen years old, the appellant told the complainant that he “loved” the complainant. The complainant said, “I love you too mate”. The complainant said this “because he was my idol… I loved golf and I looked up to him”. 
     
      
    11 One day in the appellant’s house the appellant and the complainant were watching a video. The appellant was massaging the complainant’s shoulder. The appellant lent over and kissed the complainant on the head. The complainant was shocked and jumped up. The appellant apologised for what he had done.  
     
      
    12 On an occasion in October 1993 in a bedroom at the appellant’s house the appellant began massaging the complainant. The appellant removed the complainant’s shorts and masturbated the complainant until he ejaculated (count 1 in the indictment). In his evidence the complainant described himself as feeling “very uncomfortable” and “sort of frozen” and as having no idea of what the appellant was doing. The complainant told the appellant to stop but the appellant kept saying “relax” and “it’ll be okay”. 
     
      
    13 In November 1993 the appellant and the complainant went together to Norfolk Island on a five day trip to play golf. They stayed at the house of a friend of the appellant’s, using the same bedroom. The complainant gave evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…it happened at least three times while we were there during the trip that he would either get into my bed or ask me to come and get into his bed. And he would touch me and massage me and he also – I remember took my hand and put it on his penis”. 
        
       
      
    14 While the appellant and the complainant were on Norfolk Island, the appellant began crying and told the complainant that he was going to a cliff on Norfolk Island. The complainant feared that the appellant was going to commit suicide. The appellant returned to the house where they were staying and rushed into the bathroom. The complainant found the appellant in the bathroom with his head in a basin, which was full of water. The complainant thought that the appellant was trying to drown himself. This incident had “a big time effect” on the complainant. 
     
      
    15 In January 1994 the appellant and the complainant went together to the Royal Pines Resort on the Queensland Gold Coast to play golf. The appellant paid for the trip. Before going to Queensland, the appellant had provided the complainant with a set of golf clubs and a number of items of golf clothing.  
     
      
    16 The following questions and answers occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What were the sleeping arrangements while you were in Queensland? 
         
        A. As I said there was a fold out bed in the bottom part and of an evening Noel would encourage me to come into his bed and sleep, sleep in his bed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened in his bed? 
         
        A. I remember him just playing, playing with my penis and massaging, the same as previous times, and I was, again I was very, very uncomfortable with it all and. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything to him about it? 
         
        A. Yeah, I just told him I didn’t want it like last time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. He would just keep trying to reassure me with ‘it’s okay’ and it’s okay with what’s happening and to relax and. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How many nights did this type of activity happen while you were in Queensland? 
         
        A. It happened on most of the nights while we were there, I think probably again, probably three or four times”. 
        
       
      
    17 When asked by the Crown prosecutor how he felt when he got back from Queensland, the complainant said that he was “totally confused” and did not know what to do. The complainant still looked up to the appellant. The complainant wanted himself to become a professional golfer and all he wanted to do was to play golf. 
     
      
    18 In early 1994 the complainant was struggling, confused and upset with what was happening and one day he kicked a hole in the fibro wall of his bedroom at his home. The next night the complainant’s mother came into the bedroom and found the complainant crying. The complainant’s mother asked what was happening and why the complainant was crying and the complainant told his mother that the appellant had told the complainant that he loved him and that the appellant had kissed the complainant. 
     
      
    19 The appellant had in fact on a number of occasions kissed the complainant on the lips and had told the complainant that he loved him. The appellant had also asked the complainant whether the complainant loved the appellant. The complainant gave evidence “some times I would reply and then other times I wouldn’t. Most of the time I would nod or I would say yes but most of the time I would just nod”. 
     
      
    20 On the morning after the complainant’s conversation with his mother she asked the complainant more questions and the complainant told his mother that the appellant had physically touched him. 
     
      
    21 The complainant did not recall any family meeting with the appellant but later in the trial his parents gave evidence of such a meeting. The complainant did recall that one day when the complainant was riding to school, the appellant, who was driving a car, stopped the complainant and asked the complainant what he had told his mother. The complainant replied to the appellant “nothing, I’m not telling you anything” and the complainant kept riding. 
     
      
    22 For two or three months from February 1994 to about April or May 1994 the complainant did not play golf. The complainant then resumed playing golf, which was what he wanted to do. 
     
      
    23 The complainant had a conversation with the appellant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I told him that I didn’t want to – I just want to come back, I just want to play golf and that’s all I want to do. That’s all I want to concentrate on, and Noel promised me that nothing would happen again”. 
        
       
      
    24 In the year 1994 the appellant would sometimes take the complainant to Sydney in the appellant’s car, so that the complainant could play in junior golf tournaments. On these trips the appellant would sometimes put his hand on the complainant’s thigh and would sometimes take the complainant’s hand and put it on the appellant’s thigh. 
     
      
    25 On an occasion in the second half of 1994 the appellant and the complainant went to the complainant’s home. The complainant’s parents were out. The appellant massaged the complainant, removed the complainant’s pants and masturbated the complainant until he ejaculated (count 2 in the indictment). The following questions and answers occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything to him when this was happening? 
         
        A. I was just, you know I was just uncomfortable and—“ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want this to happen? 
         
        A. Not at all, I just didn’t know what else to do”. 
        
       
      
    26 Later in 1994, in the complainant’s bedroom at the complainant’s home, the appellant massaged the complainant’s penis until it became erect and then took photographs of the complainant with a polaroid camera (count 3 in the indictment). Subsequently, the complainant asked the appellant what the appellant had done with the photographs and the appellant told the complainant that he had got rid of the photographs. Later, the complainant saw the photographs at the appellant’s pro shop at the golf course. The complainant grabbed the photographs, got some scissors and cut the photographs into very small pieces. 
     
      
    27 The following questions and answer occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. That incident with the photo, when he fondled your penis till you got an erection, did you want that to happen? 
         
        A. No, not at all”. 
        
       
      
    28 The complainant gave evidence in chief as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. There was many times where I’d – you know I just wanted – I’d say to him that I was going to tell someone and I’d – you know I couldn’t handle it any more and I wanted it to stop and I’m going to tell my parents and he’d like start or I remember one time it was at his place, it was in his lounge and he was crying again and I told him I was going – I wanted to tell someone and it just – that happened, you know, numerous times and I just – eventually you know I’d end up saying it’s all right, it’s okay and then it just kept going, that just went on and on and on and I just – I can’t believe I just put up with it all the time because I just, just felt like I had to just – felt like I had to just keep going, going along with it, you know, because I never had to pay for any of my golf equipment or anything like that, I just thought it was my only, my only way of keep doing what I wanted to do and golf and just, eventually I just –“. 
        
       
      
    29 In June 1995 the appellant drove the complainant to Mollymook to play in a golf tournament held over a weekend. The appellant and the complainant stayed at the home of a friend of the appellant’s, who had a son named Scott. The appellant and the complainant shared a bedroom. On the Friday night the appellant masturbated the complainant until he ejaculated (count 4) and “I remember this time he got me to do the same to him”. 
     
      
    30 The following questions and answers occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want him to masturbate you? 
         
        A. No, I just remember it as, just trying to be as quiet as possible, because I knew Scott’s room was next door and I didn’t want to make any noise and I just remember just telling myself that it’d be over soon, because all I was concentrating on was golf the next day and just tell myself it’d be over and kept thinking about the golf the next day just to get, so I didn’t think about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want to masturbate him? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you do it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do it? 
         
        A. Because I just, I just, just did it to keep him happy”. 
        
       
      
    31 On the following night the “same thing” happened again (count 5). The complainant gave further evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well, massage, play with my penis till I got an erection, masturbated till I ejaculated and then cleaned me up and then I did the same to him”. 
        
       
       
       ….. 
       
       
        
        “Q. Did you want to be masturbated by him? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want to masturbate him? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
      
    32 In July 1995 the complainant went with his parents to Coffs Harbour to play in a golf championship. He stayed at Coffs Harbour with his parents. The appellant met the complainant at Coffs Harbour. The appellant bought the complainant an expensive golf jacket. At the time the appellant gave the jacket to the complainant he asked the complainant whether he loved the appellant and kissed the complainant. 
     
      
    33 The complainant left school in September 1995, because he wanted to become a professional golfer. In order to become a professional golfer the complainant had to reduce his golf handicap and serve an apprenticeship with a professional golfer. The complainant had it in mind to be apprenticed to the appellant. The complainant’s goal during the rest of 1995 and in 1996 was to reduce his golf handicap, so that he could commence his apprenticeship in 1997. The complainant began working part-time in the appellant’s pro shop at the golf course and would see the appellant practically every day. 
     
      
    34 In about 1995 the appellant moved to a new house he had built, not far from the golf course. The complainant said that a number of incidents between the appellant and himself occurred at the appellant’s new house but he remembered two incidents particularly, because they were “a bit different” from the others. 
     
      
    35 On one occasion the appellant put a battery powered massage machine on the complainant’s penis until the complainant ejaculated (count 6). The complainant was asked in his evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want him to do that?” 
         
        A.  
        “No, as I said, by this point I was just – I don’t know, I couldn’t tell anyone, I just felt like I just had to go along with it. He’d often say that, you know, it was okay what was happening. I was always unsure but I just didn’t know what else to do”. 
        
       
      
    36 On the other occasion the appellant put on a pornographic video and the appellant “took my pants off, played with me till I got an erection, masturbated me ‘till I ejaculated (count 7). I did the same to him (count 8)” 
     
      
    37 The following questions and answers occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want him to masturbate you on that occasion? 
         
        A. Never, I never wanted it, I just -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want to masturbate him? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
      
    38 At Easter 1996 the appellant and the complainant went to Norfolk Island. They stayed at the house of a friend of the appellant’s, using the same bedroom. At night, “we’d go to bed and same as the other .. times”. The appellant told the complainant that he loved him, kissed the complainant and masturbated the complainant until he ejaculated. 
     
      
    39 In April 1996 the appellant and the complainant went to the North Coast, so that the complainant could play in an amateur tournament near Coffs Harbour. The appellant and the complainant stayed at a resort at Sawtell. In their room at the resort the appellant masturbated the complainant (count 9) and the complainant masturbated the appellant (count 10). “He massaged me and encouraged me to do the same to him”. The following questions and answers occurred in the complainant’s evidence in chief:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you want him to do what he did to you that night? 
         
        A. No, 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want to masturbate him? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
      
    40 In June 1996 the appellant and the complainant went again to Norfolk Island. They stayed at a guesthouse which was being run by a friend of the appellant’s Mr Graham Struthers. The complainant said in his evidence “the usual masturbating and massaging and kissing happened most nights”. One night “I remember him starting to suck my penis and I was just frozen, I didn’t know what to do and I just remember thinking that I was in another country and I just wanted to go home”. The complainant tried to push the appellant away. The appellant stopped for a moment, then said “relax, its okay” and the appellant “kept going”. 
     
      
    41 In July 1996 the appellant and the complainant and the complainant’s parents went to Coffs Harbour for a golf tournament. The appellant and the complainant shared the same room. At nights the same sort of conduct occurred again between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant said in his evidence, with respect to the appellant:- “I was totally confused … I didn’t know what to do … I still looked up to him”. 
     
      
    42 At some time in the second half of 1996 in the appellant’s bedroom in the appellant’s new house conduct occurred between the appellant and the complainant which the complainant described as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        A. I remember, I remember him just massaging and rubbing as usual and he asked me to do the same to him and then I just remember him asking me if I would suck his penis. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you? 
         
        A. No what I, I can’t believe I actually thought about it and I just kissed it once and I felt sick and I just stopped straight away and, and I just masturbated him and he would ask me to stop, he wanted to wait a little bit and I just kept going because I just wanted to finish and leave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said before he asked you to suck his penis that he’d rubbed you, where had he rubbed you? 
         
        A. What did you say, what did you say? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did he rub you? 
         
        A. He rubbed my body and my penis and -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ejaculate on that occasion? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want any of that sexual activity? 
         
        A. No not at all”. 
        
       
      
    43 The complainant’s evidence about the conduct on this occasion gave rise to counts 11 and 12 in the indictment. 
     
      
    44 At the end of 1996 the complainant undertook an examination to determine whether he would be permitted to begin a golf apprenticeship, apprenticed to the appellant. The appellant caddied for the complainant in the playing part of the examination and provided a reference for the complainant. In January 1997 the complainant commenced an apprenticeship with the appellant and the complainant worked for the appellant in his pro shop. 
     
      
    45 The complainant said in evidence that in the second year of his apprenticeship:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. ..I just remember this snapping and just going crazy and screaming and swearing at Noel. And I was telling him, I told him I was going home to tell my parents and I didn’t care what he said and I just, just walked off because I could walk home and I just walked up the ninth fairway and walked home. And I just remember, I can’t remember exactly what I said to my parents but I, I just remember Noel coming over that night and my parents speaking to me and I told them that, I told them the same things were happening again”. 
        
       
      
    46 After this meeting no further sexual activity occurred between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant completed his three year apprenticeship with the appellant.  
     
      
    47 In May 2003 the complainant first made a statement to police about what he said had happened between himself and the appellant.  
     
      
    48 At the conclusion of the complainant’s evidence in chief the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can I just ask you this finally … in relation to any of the sexual conduct that you’ve told the members of the jury that happened between you and Mr Laman, did you consent to any of it? 
         
        A. No. Never, I never said I wanted to, never. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you want any of it to happen? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    49 Early in the cross-examination of the complainant the following questions and answers occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You say don’t you that any sexual activity between the two of you was without your consent? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did not want to become involved in any sexual activity? 
         
        A. No”. 
        
       
       
      It is clear, in the context, that the answer “no” to the second question meant that the complainant was agreeing with what had been put to him in the question. 
       
      
    50 The complainant’s mother and father also gave evidence in the Crown case. Their evidence confirmed a number of parts of the complainant’s evidence. The complainant’s parents gave evidence about a meeting or meetings with the appellant in early 1994 and a further meeting with the appellant, which the complainant’s parents said had happened in 1998. 
     
      
    51 The complainant’s mother gave evidence that one evening in early 1994 she went into the complainant’s bedroom to say good night to him. Her evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…he was buried under the bed covers very upset and sobbing and I asked him what was wrong and at first he didn’t want to tell me what was wrong and I questioned him and I asked him was it school, because he’d just gone back to school and he was crying quite uncontrollably and said that everything would be spoiled or ruined, some words to that effect and I said, what’s wrong, what’s wrong and he said Noel said he loved me and kissed me”. 
        
       
      
    52 The complainant’s parents had a meeting with the appellant. At this meeting the complainant’s mother said to the appellant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I said to him that (the complainant) told me that you said that you loved him and kissed him and he just said whatever (the complainant) said is what happened and at this stage he started to go red in the face and he was upset and I was upset, …. and he continued to say that he was sorry and it shouldn’t have happened and he promised that nothing like that would ever happen again and he continued to tell me that something had happened to him when he was a boy”. 
        
       
      
    53 The complainant’s mother spoke again to the complainant, who said that the appellant had “touched” him. 
     
      
    54 The complainant’s parents had a further meeting with the appellant. At this meeting the appellant was very apologetic, said that what had happened should not have happened and promised that it would not happen again. 
     
      
    55 The complainant’s parents cancelled the golfing trip which they had proposed to take with the appellant to Norfolk Island. 
     
      
    56 On an occasion which the complainant’s mother said was in about April or May 1998 the complainant told his mother that the appellant was coming to their house that night. The appellant came to the house. In the presence of the appellant the complainant said “Mum, it never really stopped. Only, only for the few months I was away”. The complainant’s father said that he could not believe what he was hearing. The appellant said that he loved the complainant. The complainant’s father told the appellant to leave the house. 
     
      
    57 The complainant’s father gave evidence that at a meeting in early February 1994 the appellant had said that he loved the complainant and had kissed the complainant. The appellant said it should never have happened. The appellant was holding his head in his hands and crying. The complainant’s father asked the appellant to leave the house. There was another meeting with the appellant in which the appellant said that the conduct would never happen again. The complainant’s parents cancelled their proposed golfing trip to Norfolk Island with the appellant. 
     
      
    58 The complainant’s father gave evidence that on an occasion which he said was in May or June 1998 the appellant had come to the complainant’s parents’ home, after the complainant had told his parents that the appellant was coming. The complainant’s father asked the appellant “what is happening between you and (the complainant)?” and the appellant replied “it should never have happened. It won’t happen again”. 
     
      
       
      The Defence case at the Trial 
       
      
    59 The appellant gave evidence in his own case at the trial. The appellant had been the professional at the golf course since 1987. He had come to know the complainant’s parents as members at the golf course. The complainant had first come to the appellant’s notice in 1993. The complainant was more interested than the other junior members – “he’d hang around a bit more and we’d play holes in the afternoon”. 
     
      
    60 The appellant had for a number of years frequently taken groups of members at the golf course to Norfolk Island. 
     
      
    61 In November 1993 the appellant had gone to Norfolk Island with the complainant for five to seven days. The complainant had asked to go and the complainant’s parents had paid his airfare. In Norfolk Island the appellant and the complainant stayed at a house which a friend of the appellant’s Graham Struthers was minding for the owners of the house. The appellant denied that while he and the complainant were at Norfolk Island he had touched the complainant inappropriately in any way. The appellant denied that during the trip to Norfolk Island he had cried and become hysterical or that he had threatened to commit suicide or that he had put his head in water in a basin in a bathroom. 
     
      
    62 In January 1994 the appellant and the complainant had gone together to the Royal Pines Resort on the Queensland Gold Coast. The complainant had asked the appellant if he could go. The appellant denied that any sexual activity had occurred on the trip. The appellant had given the complainant a set of golf clubs and some golf clothes but he had done the same for other junior members at the golf course.  
     
      
    63 In the first week of February 1994 the complainant told the appellant that his parents wanted to see the appellant and the appellant had gone to the complainant’s parents’ home. At the complainant’s parents’ home the complainant’s mother and the complainant’s aunt told the appellant that the complainant had told them that the appellant had said to the complainant that he loved the complainant and that he had kissed the complainant. The appellant denied to the complainant’s mother and to the complainant’s aunt that such conduct had occurred. The appellant said that on one occasion the complainant had become upset while watching a tape recording at the pro shop at the golf course and the appellant had “roughed his head with my hand and kissed him on top – well pecked him on the top of his head and that was it”. The appellant also told the complainant’s mother that on another occasion, when the complainant was not playing golf well and had lost his temper, the appellant had given the complainant a pep talk and afterwards the complainant had said “why are you so good to me?” and the appellant had said “because I love you mate”. 
     
      
    64 About a week later the complainant’s parents and the complainant’s aunt had come to the appellant’s home. “Everything was okay and cleared up”. 
     
      
    65 The appellant denied that at any meeting with the complainant’s parents or either of them in early 1994 he had been accused of touching the complainant. 
     
      
    66 For a short period in 1994 the complainant had stopped playing golf but he soon returned to playing. The appellant denied that he had promised the complainant that “nothing would happen again”. 
     
      
    67 The appellant denied that any sexual activity had taken place between the appellant and the complainant at the complainant’s home.  
     
      
    68 The appellant had gone with the complainant to Mollymook. The appellant and the complainant had shared a bedroom in the house of a friend of the appellant’s. There was no other available bedroom in the house. The appellant denied that any sexual activity had occurred at Mollymook. 
     
      
    69 The complainant had gone to Coffs Harbour with his parents and the appellant had joined them. Nothing of a sexual nature had happened between the appellant and the complainant at Coffs Harbour. 
     
      
    70 The complainant left school in about September 1995. The complainant had said that he wanted to become a professional golfer. Up until the time that the complainant left school aged seventeen, nothing of a sexual nature had taken place between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    71 The complainant began working in the appellant’s pro shop at the golf course. The appellant and the complainant played together on various golf courses in an endeavour to reduce the complainant’s golf handicap so that he could commence an apprenticeship as a professional golfer. 
     
      
    72 The appellant asserted that prior to the appellant going to America in September 1996 nothing of a sexual nature had occurred between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    73 After the appellant returned from America sexual activity did for the first time take place between the appellant and the complainant, in late 1996, at a house the appellant had moved into in February 1995. Sexual activity between them at this house had continued until November 1998, when the appellant sold the house. The sexual activity took the form of masturbation and was consensual. The complainant had come to the appellant’s house twice a week and the appellant had given the complainant a key to his house. A massage machine had been used. On one occasion the appellant, at the complainant’s request, had taken photographs of the complainant. These photographs had been ripped up by the complainant later the same day. 
     
      
    74 Sexual activity took place between the appellant and the complainant at the appellant’s parents’ home, when the appellant was living there in early 1999 and up to May 1999. On three or four occasions between March and May 1999 sexual activity had taken place at the complainant’s parents house.  
     
      
    75 Consistently with his assertion that sexual activity had occurred for the first time in late 1996, the appellant denied that any sexual activity had taken place between the appellant and the complainant, when they had gone together to Norfolk Island at Easter 1996 or when they had gone together to Sawtell in late April 1996 or when they had gone to Norfolk Island in mid 1996. 
     
      
    76 In late 1996 the appellant had given the complainant a reference in connection with the complainant becoming a professional golfer.  
     
      
    77 The appellant agreed that a meeting with the complainant’s parents had taken place but said that the meeting had taken place, not in 1998, but on 30 May 1999. The appellant sought to support his evidence about when the meeting had taken place by references to entries in his 1999 diary. 
     
      
    78 The appellant said that there had been an argument between the appellant and the complainant at the golf course “because I didn’t put his footy tips in”. The appellant had said he would go to the complainant’s parents’ house and did so. The appellant told the complainant’s father that “we need to talk” and the complainant’s father called the complainant’s mother. The complainant himself was sitting in the room. The appellant’s evidence continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A …and I looked at them and I said ‘ Look, you know what we talked about a few years ago?’, and basically they just looked at me not really knowing where I was going to go, and I said ‘Well, this time things did happen’, I said ‘There was no intercourse but things did happen’, and they – and (the complainant) started crying and he sort of cried the entire time, and then (the complainant’s father) and (the complainant’s mother) basically just looked at me and I think (the complainant’s father) said sort of ‘When did this start”’ or ‘How long has it been going for?’, and I said it was about two, two and a half years, and one of them said like ‘was that during the apprenticeship?’, and I said ‘No, it was the start of the apprenticeship’, and (the complainant) was still crying and (the complainant’s mother) said to (the complainant) ‘It’s not good crying, it’s not just (the appellant’s) fault, it’s your fault too, you’re old enough’, and then I think one of them said to me’ – I was sitting there sort of didn’t know what to say. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve heard some evidence from (the complainant) and from (the complainant’s father) and (the complainant’s mother) did anyone ask (the complainant) about whether he loved you? 
         
        A. Yeah, I think it was (the complainant’s mother) that said ‘Do you love (the appellant)?’, he was crying, I don’t think he even answered and then she said ‘You must have because it wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t”. 
        
       
      
    79 After this meeting the appellant had expected that the complainant would not continue his apprenticeship but the complainant had come back about a week later and asked whether he could continue his apprenticeship. The complainant had completed his apprenticeship at the end of 1999. Subsequently the complainant had worked for the appellant for a couple of weeks in February 2000 and after that there had been further contacts between the appellant and the complainant. In 2003 there had been discussions between the appellant and the complainant about the complainant working for the appellant. 
     
      
    80 Other witnesses for the appellant were Mr Graham Struthers and Mr David Cambourn. 
     
      
    81 Mr Struthers gave evidence about the premises in which he lived at Norfolk Island and the visits of the appellant and the complainant to Norfolk Island. Mr Struthers had never observed any reluctance on the part of the complainant to be with the appellant.  
     
      
    82 Mr Cambourn, a professional golfer who was about the same age as the complainant, gave evidence about his association over a number of years with the appellant and what he had observed about the relationship over a number of years between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
       
      Convictions in Dispute  
       
      
    83 As I stated at the beginning of this judgment, the appellant was found guilty at the trial of nine charges of aggravated indecent assault (counts 1-7, 9, and 11 in the indictment) and of three charges of inciting a person above the age of sixteen years to commit an act of indecency (counts 8, 10 and 12 in the indictment).  
     
      
    84 Aggravated indecent assault is and was at all relevant times an offence under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years. In count 1 in the indictment the circumstances of aggravation alleged by the Crown were that the complainant was under the age of sixteen years at the time of the indecent assault, which was alleged to have occurred in October 1993. In counts 2-7, 9 and 11 the circumstances of aggravation alleged by the Crown were that the complainant was under the authority of the appellant at the times when the indecent assaults were alleged to have occurred. The complainant had attained the age of sixteen years when these offences were alleged to have been committed or the Crown was unable to prove that the complainant had not attained the age of sixteen years when these offences were alleged to have been committed.  
     
      
    85 Section 77 of the Crimes Act provides and at all relevant times has provided that the consent of a complainant is not a defence to a charge under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, if the complainant was under the age of sixteen years at the time when the offence charged is alleged to have been committed. In the present case the complainant was under the age of sixteen years at the time when the offence charged in the first count in the indictment was alleged to have been committed and, accordingly, any consent the complainant might have given did not afford the appellant any defence. On the hearing of this appeal this Court was informed by counsel for the appellant that, because any consent the complainant might have given was not a defence to the offence charged in the first count in the indictment, there was no appeal against the appellant’s conviction on that count. However, counsel informed the Court, the appellant was maintaining an appeal against his conviction on all the other counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    86 The three charges of inciting a person above the age of sixteen years to commit an act of indecency were based on s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act. Since 1 July 1995 s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act has provided, so far as is relevant, that a person who incites another person of the age of sixteen years or above to an act of indecency with or towards him is liable to imprisonment for eighteen months. Since 1 July 1995 s 61N(1) has provided for a similar offence where the person incited to commit an act of indecency is under the age of sixteen years. 
     
      
    87 However, prior to 1 July 1995 s 61N, so far as is relevant, created a single offence of inciting a person under the age of sixteen years to commit an act of indecency with or towards the offender. On this appeal it was conceded by the Crown that the period within which it was alleged that the offence charged in count 8 in the indictment had been committed commenced before 1 July 1995 and the Crown had not established that the offence had been committed on or after 1 July 1995 and consequently the appeal against the appellant’s conviction on count 8 had to be allowed. On the other hand, the offences charged in counts 10 and 12 in the indictment were alleged to have been committed within periods commencing after 1 July 1995 and the convictions on those counts were not open to the same objection as the conviction on count 8. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal against Conviction 
       
       
        
        “1. The verdicts of the jury on Counts 2,3,4,5,6,7,9, and 11 are unreasonable, and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
         
        2. The learned judge failed adequately to refer to the relevant evidence in directing the jury on the issue of consent as it bore upon the aforesaid counts. 
         
        3. The learned judge wrongly directed, and omitted to direct, the jury on the issue of consent. 
         
        4. The convictions on counts 8, 10 were unsupported by evidence, and neither they nor count 12 can stand if any of the foregoing grounds are made good”. 
         
        
       
      
    88 I will deal with these grounds of appeal in turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    89 At the trial it was part of the defence case that the appellant had not done any of the acts which the Crown alleged constituted indecent assaults on the complainant, with the possible exception of the act which the Crown alleged constituted the indecent assault charged in count 11. 
     
      
    90 The Crown alleged that all of the indecent assaults, apart from the indecent assault charged in count 11, had been committed no later than the end of April 1996. The indecent assault charged in count 11 was alleged to have been committed at some time within the period from 1 July 1996 to 31 December 1996. 
     
      
    91 The appellant gave evidence at the trial that before he went to America in September 1996 nothing of a sexual nature had ever occurred between the appellant and the complainant and that it was only after the appellant had returned from America in late 1996 that, for the first time, sexual activity had occurred between them. 
     
      
    92 Although it was part of the defence case at the trial that the appellant had not done the acts which the Crown alleged had occurred and had constituted indecent assaults, it was not submitted on this appeal that it had not been open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had in fact done all of those acts. What was submitted on this appeal was that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to the doing of those acts by the appellant. 
     
      
    93 An ingredient of the offence of indecent assault under s 61M of the Crimes Act is, of course, that the offender assaulted the complainant. On a charge of indecent assault it is necessary, unless the complainant is under the age of sixteen years and s 77 of the Crimes Act applies, for the Crown to prove that the complainant did not consent to the act on the part of the offender alleged to constitute the indecent assault R v Bonora (1994) 35 NSWLR 74. Accordingly, in the present case it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt on all of counts 2-7, 9 and 11 that the complainant did not consent to the act of the appellant alleged to constitute the indecent assault. 
     
      
    94 In his submissions counsel for the appellant referred to the complainant’s evidence about the commission of each of the alleged offences of indecent assault and submitted that at the close of the complainant’s evidence in chief there was no evidence on any charge of an absence of consent on the part of the complainant but only evidence of a reluctance or an absence of desire on the part of the complainant. It was pointed out by counsel that a consent given reluctantly is nevertheless a consent. 
     
      
    95 Counsel for the appellant referred to the form of a question the complainant had been asked a number of times in his examination in chief, the answers to which were relied on by the Crown as establishing absence of consent. In the examination in chief of the complainant, after the complainant had given evidence of each instance of sexual activity between himself and the appellant, the Crown prosecutor had usually asked the complainant a question in the form of whether the complainant had “wanted” the sexual activity to happen and on each occasion the complainant had answered in the negative. 
     
      
    96 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the question the complainant had been asked, whether he had wanted the particular sexual activity to happen, was not an apt question to elicit evidence of an absence of consent. Such a question confused the concept of absence of consent with the concept of absence of desire. 
     
      
    97 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that other evidence given after the close of the complainant’s examination in chief strengthened the submission that it had not been open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to each instance of sexual activity. 
     
      
    98 The principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in determining whether a verdict of guilty by a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence have been authoritatively stated by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. See also R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223. The question to be determined is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof, acting reasonably and taking into account the whole of the evidence. 
     
      
    99 Having conducted my own independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, I have concluded that it was open to the jury, acting reasonably and taking into account the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to any of the indecent assaults alleged in counts 2-7, 9 and 11 and that, consequently, it was open to the jury to return verdicts of guilty on those counts. 
     
      
    100 I consider that it would have been open to the jury to accept inter alia the following evidence by the complainant which was relevant to the issue of whether he had consented to the appellant’s acts. 
     
      
    101 The complainant first became acquainted with the appellant, when he was only about ten years old. The appellant was the professional golfer at the local golf course. The complainant loved playing golf and idolised the appellant. He continued to idolise the appellant throughout the periods in which the assaults occurred. 
     
      
    102 When the appellant first kissed the complainant, the complainant was shocked and jumped up and the appellant apologised for what he had done.  
     
      
    103 The first indecent assault charged occurred when the complainant was fifteen years old and completely sexually naïve. The complainant described himself as “uncomfortable” and “sort of frozen”. 
     
      
    104 While the appellant and the complainant were in Norfolk Island in November 1993 the appellant, at least to the complainant’s perception, attempted to commit suicide as a result of his feelings for the complainant and this had a powerful effect on an immature boy of fifteen. 
     
      
    105 At the Royal Pines Resort in Queensland in January 1994 the complainant was “very, very uncomfortable” with the sexual activity and told the appellant that he did not want it to happen. 
     
      
    106 In early 1994, when the complainant spoke to his mother about the appellant’s conduct, the complainant was severely emotionally distressed. The complainant’s evidence on this matter was corroborated by his mother’s evidence. 
     
      
    107 When the complainant resumed playing golf after a gap of two to three months, the complainant told the appellant that all he wanted to do was play golf and that he did not want any sexual activity to happen. The appellant promised the complainant that nothing of a sexual nature would happen. 
     
      
    108 After the complainant discovered the photographs the appellant had taken of him when his penis was erect, the complainant grabbed the photographs and destroyed them. 
     
      
    109 It would have been open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant’s conduct towards the complainant, in the context of the complainant’s general idolising of the appellant as a professional golfer, produced in the complainant a state of confusion and powerlessness, manifested, for example, in the almost incoherent evidence given by the complainant which I quoted earlier in this judgment (after the complainant’s evidence about the third count in the indictment). 
     
      
    110 In June 1996 when the appellant started sucking the complainant’s penis the complainant was “just frozen. I didn’t know what to do and I just remember thinking that I was in another country and I just wanted to go home”. The complainant tried to push the appellant away. 
     
      
    111 Finally, during his apprenticeship, the complainant “snapped” and told his parents what had been happening. 
     
      
    112 I have already referred to the submission made by counsel for the appellant that a question in the terms of “did you want that to happen?” was not an apt question to elicit evidence of absence of consent and confused or conflated absence of consent with mere absence of desire. 
     
      
    113 In my opinion, the attempted distinction between a question in the terms “did you want that to happen?” and a question in the terms “did you consent to that happening?” is excessively refined and, as used in the taking of evidence in this trial, the question which was put to the complainant “did you want that to happen?” was understood as being substantially equivalent to a question “did you consent to that happening?” 
     
      
    114 I would infer that that was the understanding of counsel for the appellant at the trial, who, as I have indicated earlier in this judgment, asked the complainant successive questions early in his cross-examination of the complainant:- “You say, don’t you, that any sexual activity between the two of you was without your consent” and “you did not want to become involved in any sexual activity?” Furthermore, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not at the conclusion of the Crown case make any application for any directed verdict on the grounds that there was no evidence of an absence of consent on the part of the complainant. 
     
      
    115 I also infer that it was the understanding of the Crown prosecutor at the trial who, without any objection by counsel for the appellant at the trial or the trial judge, submitted to the jury:- “And, in fact, you heard (the complainant) repeatedly say in his evidence in relation to each of these incidents, it was not what he wanted, it was not with his consent”. 
     
      
    116 At the conclusion of the complainant’s evidence in chief the complainant was asked whether he had “consented” to any of the sexual conduct he had described as having happened between the appellant and himself and the complainant replied, “no, never”. 
     
      
    117 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3 
       
      
    118 These grounds of appeal were dealt with together in the appellant’s written submissions and I will deal with them together. 
     
      
    119 No objection was taken at the trial to any of the trial judge’s directions about consent and hence leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required to rely on these grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    120 The principal directions given by the trial judge in his summing-up on the subject of consent, which were quoted in the appellant’s written submissions, were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I also told you that in relation to certain counts in the indictment that it was necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the acts that were involved. Just to make clear which counts it applies to, the need for proof of consent applies to counts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11. In relation to consent it is for the Crown to prove the lack of consent. The accused does not have to prove that the complainant consented, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not. 
        
       
       
        
        The idea of consent involves the conscious and voluntary permission by the complainant to engage in the sexual act with the accused. It is something that can be given verbally or expressed by actions. Similarly, absence of consent does not have to be in words, it may be communicated in other ways. Consent which is obtained after persuasion is still consent, however, the law provides that a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse or sexual misbehaviour, as alleged here, is not by reason only of that fact to be regarded as consenting to sexual intercourse. There may be, in other words, background external factors which bring about that situation. 
        
       
       
        
        I also suggested to you that in relation to consent the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person knew that the complainant was not consenting. This is a subjective test, not an objective one. In other words, you have to be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that in the mind of the accused, as distinct from a reasonable third party, that he was aware that consent was not being given. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown asks you in this case to infer from facts the evidence particularly of (the complainant) that the accused must have known and indeed knew that he was a reluctant participant. In other words, that he was not consenting, that he was a victim in other words. 
        
       
       
        
        The law also provides in relation to consent that if the accused person does not address his mind to whether the consent was there or not, that amounts to a lack of consent. In other words, if the accused’s state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not the complainant was consenting at all and just went ahead with the act of sexual intercourse notwithstanding, that a risk that the complainant was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with the accused’s mental capacity if he turned his mind to it”. 
        
       
      
    121 Exception was taken to two passages in this part of the summing-up. The first of these passages is the passage reading:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown asks you in this case to infer from facts the evidence particularly of (the complainant) that the accused must have known and indeed knew that he was a reluctant participant. In other words, that he was not consenting, that he was a victim in other words”. 
        
       
      
    122 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that in this passage in the summing-up the trial judge had wrongly conflated the two notions of the accused being a reluctant participant and the accused not consenting. The accused could have been a reluctant participant and yet have consented, even if reluctantly, to the sexual activity charged. 
     
      
    123 I note that in this passage in the summing-up the trial judge was not giving the jury a direction but was repeating a submission which had been made by the Crown. I also note that in this passage the trial judge was dealing with the element of the offence of indecent assault that the offender knew that the complainant was not consenting and not with the element that the complainant was not consenting.  
     
      
    124 However, more fundamentally, even if in other contexts “reluctance” might not be inconsistent with the giving of consent, in the passage in the present summing-up the trial judge, having used the expression “reluctant participant,” immediately went on to define what he meant by that expression – “in other words he was not consenting”. The trial judge had already directed the jury that the Crown had to prove that the complainant had not consented, that consent involved conscious and voluntary permission by the complainant to the appellant to engage in the sexual act and that consent obtained after persuasion was still consent. 
     
      
    125 I would reject this first submission by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    126 The other passage in the part of the summing-up I have quoted to which exception was taken is the part reading:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The law also provides in relation to consent that if the accused person does not address his mind to whether the consent was there or not, that amounts to a lack of consent”.  
        
       
      
    127 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant, and it is clearly correct, that this passage, as recorded in the transcript of the summing-up, is erroneous and, indeed nonsensical. A failure by the accused to turn his mind to whether the complainant was consenting could not possibly amount to an absence of consent on the part of the complainant. 
     
      
    128 The immediately following passage in the summing-up, as punctuated in the transcript of the summing-up included in the appeal books, is not fully coherent. However, it seems clear to me that the comma which has been placed after the word “notwithstanding” and which I infer would have been placed there by a court reporter, should have been placed before that word. On this reading the passage beginning with the words “in other words” explains what his Honour meant in the passage to which objection was taken by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    129 In my opinion, the jury would have understood that the paragraph beginning with the words “the law also provides” was concerned with the element of the offence that the offender knew that the complainant was not consenting and was directing the jury that that element of the offence could be made out, even if the accused had not turned his mind to whether the complainant was consenting. Notwithstanding the way in which the first sentence in the paragraph is literally expressed, I do not consider that the jury would have understood it to mean, in its context, that a failure by the accused to turn his mind to whether the complainant had consented entailed a conclusion that there had been an absence of consent on the part of the complainant. The very illogicality of such reasoning would have militated against the jury understanding it in that way. As I have previously noted, no objection was taken by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    130 It was submitted that the jury had not been directed that the issue of consent had to be considered by them on each count in its context and the jury had not been told that they could decide the issue differently on different counts. However, the trial judge in his summing-up had summarised the evidence on each count individually and had not been asked by counsel for the appellant at the trial to go into any further detail. Elsewhere in the summing-up the trial judge had expressly told the jury that there were really twelve separate trials, that the jury had to consider the evidence relevant to each particular charge and make a particular finding in relation to each charge and that “you have to address your mind twelve times to each of the separate charges and determine whether each one has been made out or not”. 
     
      
    131 I would reject grounds 2 and 3 in the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    132 As previously stated, the Crown conceded that the appeal against the conviction on count 8 had to succeed. 
     
      
    133 With regard to the convictions on counts 10 and 12, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was insufficient evidence from the complainant to enable the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element of the offence charged, that the appellant had “incited” the complainant to commit an act of indecency, had been proved. It was not sufficient, it was contended, that the complainant had given evidence that the appellant had “encouraged” the complainant to masturbate the appellant (count 10) or had “asked” the complainant to masturbate the appellant (count 12). Evidence should have been given of what the appellant had done or said by way of encouraging or asking the complainant. 
     
      
    134 In my opinion, on the evidence given by the complainant, which was not objected to, that he had been asked or encouraged by the appellant to masturbate the appellant, particularly in the context of all of the evidence given by the complainant, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on each of counts 10 and 12 that the appellant had incited the complainant to commit an act of indecency. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    135 A further submission was made by counsel for the appellant under this ground of appeal but as the submission depended on this Court upholding earlier grounds of appeal against conviction, it is unnecessary to deal with this further submission. 
     
      
    136 I would reject the fourth ground of appeal. 
     
      
    137 As I am of the opinion that all four grounds of appeal against conviction should be rejected, I consider that the appeal against conviction, apart from the appeal against the conviction on count 8, should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    138 The grounds of appeal against sentence were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The individual sentences were, and the total was, excessive. 
         
        2. The learned judge erred in imposing sentences conformably with the legislative regime current at the time of sentence but not of application to the offences because of their dates. 
         
        3. The learned judge failed to give effect to the finding, properly made, and expressly conceded by the Crown that there were “special circumstances” relative to the offender.” 
        
       
      
      
    139 It is convenient to deal first with the specific grounds of appeal before dealing with ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    140 It was submitted that all of the offences had been committed before 1 February 2003 and therefore the sentencing judge should have sentenced the appellant in accordance with the previous, and not the present, s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, the sentencing judge had sentenced the appellant on counts 2-7, 9 and 11 in accordance with the present s 44 of the Act by first setting a non-parole period and then setting a balance of the term. 
     
      
    141 These submissions by counsel for the appellant are well founded and error did occur in the sentencing of the appellant. However, as the Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, held in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264, this is an error which has occurred on a number of occasions since 1 February 2003 and “is a technical error of little or no practical significance” (par 39). The Chief Justice added that this Court should intervene to impose sentences in accordance with the correct legislative provision but, unless some other error is established, this Court should not otherwise intervene. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    142 In his remarks on sentence Judge Phelan said that the Crown did not dispute that there were special circumstances justifying a proportionally longer than normal parole period. His Honour identified those circumstances as being that the sentences about to be imposed would be the appellant’s first experience of prison and would be served on some form of protection. 
     
      
    143 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that in the sentences which the sentencing judge had actually imposed his Honour had failed to give effect to his finding that there were special circumstances and that there should be a proportionally longer than normal parole period. 
     
      
    144 I do not consider that this submission should be upheld. It is not to the point that the sentences imposed on count 1 and counts 10 and 12 were fixed terms of imprisonment, without any non-parole period. What has to be considered is the total effect of the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge. The sentences imposed on counts 2-7, 9 and 11 were concurrent sentences each totalling five years with a non-parole period of three years, commencing one year after the commencement of the sentence imposed on count 1. Hence, the total effect of the sentences was that the appellant was sentenced to non-parole periods totalling four years and balances of terms or parole periods totalling two years. Accordingly, the total effect of the sentences was that the balances of the terms or parole periods exceeded one third of the total non-parole periods and effect was given by the sentencing judge to his finding about special circumstances.  
     
      
    145 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    146 I do not consider that the fact that the appeal against conviction has succeeded on count 8 and the conviction and sentence on count 8 must be quashed should, of itself, produce the consequence that this Court should hold that the total sentences imposed on the appellant or any of the individual sentences passed on the other counts should be set aside. The sentence imposed on count 8 was made fully concurrent with the sentences imposed on counts 10 and 12 and fully concurrent with the first year of the sentences imposed on counts 2-7, 9 and 11. 
     
      
    147 In his remarks on sentence Judge Phelan noted that there had been a number of offences, that they were objectively serious and that there had been planning by the appellant, for example in taking the complainant to resorts. There had been an abuse of trust by the appellant but, as his Honour correctly noted, it was an element of most of the offences that the complainant had been under the authority of the appellant. The complainant’s evidence and a Victim Impact Statement showed that the complainant had suffered serious emotional harm as a result of the appellant’s conduct. 
     
      
    148 In his remarks on sentence Judge Phelan noted some of the subjective features of the appellant. He had been a professional golfer since 1979. He had no previous criminal record and there was no evidence that he had had a relationship of a similar sort with any other boy or youth. A pre-sentence report disclosed nothing remarkable about the appellant. At the time of being sentenced the appellant was in a heterosexual relationship. The sentencing judge appears to have accepted an opinion of a psychologist that the appellant was “not currently at significant risk of sexual re-offending, provided that sensible safeguards are observed”. Judge Phelan noted that the appellant had suffered serious extra-curial punishment for his offending, including loss of his career as a professional golfer and the loss of his golfing business interests. 
     
      
    149 Ultimately, very little was put by counsel for the appellant in support of this ground of appeal. Having considered the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the appellant and the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider that it has not been shown that the sentences imposed on the appellant were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    150 In my opinion the following orders should be made. 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction on count 8 in the indictment allowed. Conviction and sentence on count 8 quashed. Verdict of acquittal on count 8. 
       
      
     2. Otherwise appeal against conviction dismissed. 
     
      
     3. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
     
      
       
      4. Appeal against sentence on counts 2-7, 9 and 11 allowed and the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge on those counts on 12 April 2005 quashed but only for the purpose of imposing sentences complying with s 44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       as in force at the time of the offences. 
       
       
      5. In lieu thereof on each of counts 2-7, 9 and 11 the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 1 November 2005. 
       
       
      6. Otherwise appeal against sentence dismissed.

    2 BARR J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The appellant stood trial before a jury in the District Court on a charge that he, on or about 1 April 2003, did attempt to possess prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act applies, namely narcotics goods consisting of a quantity of heroin, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the drug. On 19 October 2004 the jury convicted the appellant of that offence. On 17 December 2004 Judge Keleman (the Judge) sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 14 years and one month with a non-parole period of eight years and one month. The appellant appeals against his conviction but there is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    4 By reason of the nature of the grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant, it is unnecessary to relate the facts in the Crown case in any great detail in order to have an appreciation of the arguments raised in this Court. The facts can be summarised as follows. On 20 March 2003 a refrigerated container holding a shipment of 832 cartons of frozen seafood arrived in Sydney. The shipment originated in Cambodia and was consigned to Hung Cheung Sea Foods Pty Ltd. According to the shipping documentation, there were cartons of frozen fish paste, prawn meat and squid. Each of the cartons in the shipment was x-rayed by the Australian Customs Service and ten of the cartons containing fish paste were found to have “internal anomalies”. Each of these ten cartons had a small red texta marking on it. 
     
      
    5 The marked cartons were seized and examined by Australian Federal Police. They found a total of 70 blocks of heroin concealed within the fish paste in the ten cartons. The heroin was removed and the cartons reconstructed and repacked into the container. The Australian Quarantine Service permitted the container to be removed from the wharf to the premises of the importer but required that the cartons of fish paste not be removed from those premises until inspected. 
     
      
    6 Under instructions from the appellant the container was delivered to Shane’s Frozen Foods at Riverwood on 1 April 2003. The container was unpacked and the contents placed into the cold storage room in the premises. The appellant was present when the container was unloaded. At about 6.15pm that evening the appellant drove his van into the loading bay and placed a number of cartons into it. The appellant then left the premises in his van under police surveillance. He drove to Lakemba where he stopped and alighted from his vehicle, walking towards premises in Morton Street. He returned to his vehicle a short time later and then drove to Marrickville stopping near the Hung Cheung Sea Food restaurant. The appellant’s vehicle was followed by another vehicle from Lakemba to Marrickville. This vehicle parked near the appellant’s vehicle. The appellant left his vehicle and walked towards the restaurant. The other vehicle then drove away. 
     
      
    7 About 45 minutes later the appellant walked back to his vehicle carrying a black satchel. He re-entered his vehicle and drove away. About three minutes later the appellant parked his car, got out and walked towards premises nearby. About 18 minutes later he returned to his vehicle. He then drove into a street that ended in a cul-de-sac, turned around and then returned to the vicinity of Shane’s Frozen Foods where Federal police stopped him. In the appellant’s van police found a number of cartons including three of those marked with the red texta that appeared not to have been opened. The other seven marked cartons were found in the warehouse. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was arrested and participated in a video-recorded interview with police. He said that he acted as an importing agent on behalf of Hung Cheung Sea Foods, a business that was owned by a man he knew as Simon and who provided the accused with money to pay for everything. He said that he already had some suspicion about the marked cartons when he put them into his van because Simon had told him a week earlier that, if he saw any boxes with red marks on them, he was to bring them to him at his restaurant. He said that he only loaded three boxes with a red mark on them, as they were the only ones he saw. 
     
      
    9 The appellant told police he did not think about what was inside the marked boxes but found it strange because Simon told him particularly about those boxes and said to take them to the restaurant. He said that Simon also told him that, if he saw any car following him, he was not to go to the restaurant but was to park the van somewhere. He told police that he parked the van and walked to the restaurant but, as he did not see Simon, he decided to return to the van and drive it back to the warehouse. He denied that he knew what was inside the marked boxes. He told police that the money that was found on him when he was arrested was the residue of $5,000 that Simon had owed him. 
     
      
    10 The only issue at trial was whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the cartons with the red markings contained heroin. There was no issue that the appellant intended to take possession of the cartons but the dispute was whether, at the time he did so, he intended to take possession of the drugs that he believed were inside. The Crown case was a circumstantial one. The Crown asked the jury to infer from the circumstances of the importation and the appellant’s conduct in relation to the marked cartons that, at the time he took possession of them, he believed that they contained, or were likely to contain, narcotic goods. The circumstances relied upon by the Crown included the following: the appellant’s involvement in the importation of the cartons; that the appellant knowingly took the cartons of fish paste from the warehouse contrary to the embargo placed upon them by the Quarantine Service; the conduct of the appellant after he left the warehouse with the marked cartons and before his arrest; and his admission that he was suspicious about the cartons from what he had been told by Simon. 
     
      
    11 In effect the defence case was that, although the appellant might have been suspicious of what was in the marked cartons, the Crown could not prove to the requisite standard that he knew or believed that the cartons contained narcotics. It was submitted to the jury on his behalf that in effect he was Simon’s dupe. 
     
      
    12 There are two grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant in challenging his conviction. The first ground is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from the appellant’s answers to Q164 and Q165 in the police interview. 
        
       
      
    13 During the interview the following two questions were recorded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. 164 I put to you that you knew something was in that red box, the box with the red mark on it? 
         
         
        A. No, I don’t know anything. I cannot answer your questions regarding this. 
         
         
        Q.165 If you knew it was suspicious, why did you take them? 
         
         
        A. Let me give you the answer to that later. Excuse me, may I use the toilet facility? 
         
        
       
       
      In respect of Question 165, the police never asked the appellant that question again during the course of the interview. 
       
      
    14 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that in effect his response to these two questions was to decline to answer them. It is argued that, since they concern the nature of the appellant’s suspicion about the cartons, this being the critical issue in the trial, there was a risk that the jury would draw an adverse inference from the appellant’s responses to these questions. Relying upon a number of decisions of this Court, including R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 115 and R v Skaf (2004) 60 NSWLR 86 at [143], it was submitted that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury that the exercise of the right to silence in respect of these questions cannot be used to ground any inference adverse to the accused. Reliance was also placed on s 89 of the Evidence Act which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        89 Evidence of silence  
         
        (1) In a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused:  
         
          
          (a) to answer one or more questions, or  
           
          (b) to respond to a representation,  
          
         
        put or made to the party or other person in the course of official questioning.  
         
        (2) Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference.  
         
        (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding.  
         
        (4) In this section:  
         
        “inference” includes:  
         
          
          (a) an inference of consciousness of guilt, or  
           
          (b) an inference relevant to a party’s credibility. 
          
         
        
       
      
    15 In my opinion these answers could not give rise to a suggestion in the jury’s mind that the appellant had refused to answer any of the police questions, let alone give rise to some risk of prejudice to the appellant that the trial judge needed to address. The first question was in effect answered. The appellant simply deferred the answer to the second question and then asked to go to the toilet. There was an earlier question in the record of interview where the appellant deferred giving an answer until some time later in the interview. I do not believe that it would be taken to be the appellant’s fault that the police did not return to the subject matter of the second question and so it was left unanswered. In considering what the jury would have made of these answers, regard should be had to the fact that the appellant was answering questions in Vietnamese and an interpreter was translating them. Defence counsel in his address relied upon possible misinterpretations and inaccuracies in the answers as recorded. He also relied upon the fact that the appellant had been arrested in circumstances that might have terrified him and asked the jury to consider the answers in that light. 
     
      
    16 In any event no request was made for any direction or warning to the jury in relation to these two answers and, therefore, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. It should be noted that, although defence counsel at the trial filed an affidavit in relation to the second ground of appeal, he said nothing about why he did not ask for a direction or caution in respect of the matter raised by this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    17 The onus is upon the appellant to show that there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice arising from the failure by the trial judge to give a warning in relation to these questions and answers. Notwithstanding that the questions and answers concerned the appellant’s suspicions as to the marked cartons, I am not satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has arisen by the failure of the judge to caution the jury about the appellant’s right of silence. In my opinion it may have worked to the appellant’s disadvantage for the Judge to pick out those particular questions and answers and highlight to the jury the fact that what the appellant said could be construed as a refusal to answer questions at that point in the record of interview and on that issue. Even if defence counsel saw those questions and answers as giving rise to any possible prejudice to the appellant, I can well understand why he would not seek a warning or direction in relation to them when he could otherwise rely upon the fact that the appellant had voluntarily participated in a relatively lengthy record of interview with the police. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion rule 4 should apply and leave to argue this ground be refused. 
     
      
    19 The second ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The trial judge erred in his directions on the mental element of the offence. 
        
       
      
    20 Throughout his summing up the trial judge directed the jury that the real issue in dispute between the parties was the mental state of the appellant in relation to the marked cartons and, in particular, whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that those cartons contained, or were likely to contain, narcotic goods. In relation to the elements of the offence, the Judge directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ….the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that not only did the accused actually attempt to possess the narcotic goods, but also that the accused intended, in the sense that the accused meant, to possess those narcotic goods. Such intention is established if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused from the time he collected the three red marked cartons believed that they contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods. The word “likely” in this context means the accused believed that there was a significant or real chance that the three red marked cartons contained narcotic goods. 
        
       
      
    21 The appellant complains that the directions in this passage of the summing up, and generally, were in error because “they transformed matters of fact into propositions of law”. In particular, the complaint is made that the directions given by the trial judge in relation to the mental element of intention were “less demanding” than would have been the case had the provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) (the Code) in relation to recklessness been applicable. It was further submitted that the line between “suspicion” on the one hand and “belief that there is a real chance” on the other was “a fine one indeed”. So, it was argued, in a case where the appellant admitted suspicion about the contents of the marked cartons, the jury were unlikely to have difficulty in concluding that he was aware that there was a significant or real chance that the cartons contained narcotic goods. The complaint is that the finding by the jury that the appellant did have such awareness was not necessarily conclusive of the fact that he intended to possess narcotic goods. 
     
      
    22 The facts giving rise to the trial occurred on 1 April 2003. The relevant provision of the Customs Act was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        233B(1) Any person who:  
         
         
        (c) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him) has in his possession any prohibited imports to which this section applies which have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or  
         
         
        shall be guilty of an offence. 
         
         
        (1AA)  
         
        For the purposes of an offence against paragraph (1)(c) or (caa), absolute liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the prohibited imports have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act.  
         
        Note: For  
        absolute liability 
        , see section 6.2 of the  
        Criminal Code 
        .  
         
         
        (2)  
         
        The prohibited imports to which this section applies are prohibited imports that are narcotic goods and the prohibited exports to which this section applies are prohibited exports that are narcotic goods.  
         
         
        
       
      
    23 Under the Code, generally speaking, every offence must contain at least one physical element and one corresponding fault element: s 3.1 of the Code. For statutory offences to which the Code applies, an offence alleging that a person was in possession of a thing contains a physical element of conduct: see s 4.1(1) and the definition of “conduct” in s 4.1(2) which includes “a state of affairs”. Section 233B(1)(c) does not contain any reference to a fault element in relation to that physical element of conduct. However, s 5.6(1) of the Code provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        5.6 Offences that do not specify fault elements 
         
        (1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element. 
         
        
       
      
    24 In R v Saengsai-Or (2004) 61 NSWLR 135 this Court considered the impact of the provisions of the Code on s 233B(1) as it was at the time of the trial presently under consideration. In that case it had been argued by the Crown that for an offence of importing narcotic goods under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act there were two physical elements present: one being a physical element of conduct (the importing) and the other being a physical element of circumstance (the thing being imported was narcotic goods). The Court rejected that interpretation of the section principally on the basis that it was not the intention of the legislature to alter the common law in relation to proof of the elements of the offence. The Court held consistently with that view that the offence contained only one physical element of conduct (importing narcotic goods). Similar reasoning should be applied to an offence under s 233B(1)(c) and the Crown did not suggest otherwise. 
     
      
    25 As, therefore, the offence under s 233B(1)(c) consists of a single physical element of conduct, by application of s 5.6(1) of the Code, the applicable fault element is one of intention. Section 5.2(1) of the Code relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        5.2 Intention 
          
         
        (1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct. 
         
        
       
      
    26 In respect of the allegation that the appellant attempted to take possession of the narcotic goods, s 11.1 of the Code relevantly provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        11.1 Attempt 
          
         
        (1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.  
         
         
        (2) For the person to be guilty, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.  
         
         
        (3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted.  
         
         
        Note: Under section 3.2, only one of the fault elements of intention or knowledge would need to be established in respect of each physical element of the offence attempted. 
         
        
       
      
    27 It was necessary, then, for the Crown to prove that the appellant intended, or meant, to take possession of narcotic goods in order to prove that he attempted to possess narcotic goods. Therefore, for the purposes of s 233B(1)(c), as it applied at the trial, the Crown had to prove that the appellant had the intention, or meant, to take possession of the narcotic drugs that had been in the marked cartons. It should be noted that knowledge of the presence of the drug in the cartons was not an element of the offence and, therefore, the definition of knowledge in s 5.3 of the Code did not apply. 
     
      
    28 It has been held under the common law that, where the Crown is required to prove an intention to import or to take possession of narcotic goods, the jury can be directed that such an intention might be inferred from a finding that the accused acted with a knowledge or belief that the thing being imported or to be possessed was, or was likely to be, narcotic goods. In Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502 in their joint judgment, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ stated (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Where, as here, it is necessary to show an intention on the part of the accused to import a narcotic drug, that intent is established if the accused knew or was aware that an article which he intentionally brought into Australia comprised or contained narcotic drugs. But that is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained narcotic drugs would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and nevertheless persisted in that conduct.  
        As a practical matter, the inference of mens rea or a guilty mind will ordinarily be irresistible in cases involving the importation of narcotic drugs if it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually imported the drugs and that he was aware, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in what he was importing and of the likelihood that it was a narcotic drug. 
         What we have said is designed to emphasise that the existence of the requisite intention is a question of fact and that in most cases the outcome will depend on an inference to be drawn from primary facts found by the tribunal of fact.  
        In this, as in other areas of the law, it is important not to succumb to the temptation of transforming matters of fact into propositions of law. In that regard, we would emphasise that the foregoing comments are not designed as a direction or instruction to be read by trial judges to juries. They are intended to give guidance to trial judges in order to enable them to formulate such directions as may be appropriate to the facts and circumstances of particular cases. 
         
          
        
       
      
    29 In Saad v The Queen (1987) 61 ALJR 243 their Honours returned to what they had said in Kural and stated (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………..In our judgment in Kural v R (1987) 70 ALR 658, we sought to give such guidance in a case where the alleged offence was the importing of a prohibited import. We emphasised then, and we do so again, that our comments were not designed as a direction or instruction to be read by trial judges to juries. Our comments are intended to give guidance to trial judges in order to enable them to formulate such directions as may be appropriate to the facts and circumstances of particular cases. In the following paragraph of this judgment, we apply what was said in Kural to an offence such as that involved in the present case. 
         
         
         In a case such as the present  
        where it is necessary to show an intention on the part of an accused to have in his possession a narcotic drug, that intent is established if the accused knew or was aware that an article which was intentionally in his possession comprised or contained a narcotic drug 
        . That is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element of the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained a narcotic drug would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof of the possession of the forbidden drug in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and he nevertheless persisted in that conduct.  
        As a practical matter, the inference of mens rea or a guilty mind will ordinarily be irresistible in cases involving the possession of narcotic drugs if it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was actually in possession of the drug and that he was aware, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in his possession and of the likelihood that it was a narcotic drug. 
         
         
         As we have indicated, the previous paragraph involves no more than an application of what we said in our judgment in Kural.  
        As in Kural, we would emphasise that the existence of the requisite intention is a question of fact and that in most cases the outcome will depend on an inference to be drawn from the facts established by the prosecution and that, in this as in other areas of the law, it is important not to succumb to the temptation of transforming matters of fact into propositions of law. 
         
          
        
       
      
    30 The High Court returned to the issue in Pereira v DPP (1988) 63 ALJR 1. In the joint judgment of the Court the following was stated (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….In Kural v R (1987) 162 CLR 502; 70 ALR 658 it was emphasised (CLR at 505 and 511–12) that in this area it is important not to transform matters of fact into propositions of law. That case was concerned not with what constituted “knowledge” as a distinct element of an offence but with the unspecified requirement that the accused had acted with mens rea or a guilty mind. It was pointed out in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ (CLR at 504) that, depending upon the nature of the particular offence, “the requirement of a guilty mind may involve intention, foresight, knowledge or awareness with respect to some act, circumstance or consequence”. Their Honours concluded (CLR at 504–5) that  
        actual knowledge or awareness of the presence of the particular substance was not an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence involved in that case, namely, the offence of importing a prohibited import 
        . 
         
        
       
      
    31 This line of authority was applied by this Court in R v Veraga [2001] NSWCCA 24 in respect of a charge of importing narcotic goods contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act. It was accepted that in order to prove that offence the Crown had to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to import the narcotic goods. However, as is so frequently the case, the issue that arose at the trial was one of whether the Crown could prove that the appellant believed that narcotic goods were, or were likely to be, in a bag that he brought into the country. This Court confirmed that the relevant test in order to prove the mental element of the offence was that set out in Kural. 
     
      
    32 It appears to have been common for judges in this State when summing up to a jury in relation to the mental element of any of the offences under s 233B(1) to do so in terms that the mental element could be proved by the Crown satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the thing being imported or possessed was, or was likely to be, narcotic goods: see for example R v Muradian [2002] NSWCCA 371. Similarly trial judges have directed juries routinely that the mental element in relation to the possession of prohibited drugs under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is whether the accused knew that the substance he or she possessed or intended to possess was, or was likely to be, a prohibited drug: see for example R v Lau (1998) 105 A Crim R 167 and R v Ruiz-Avila [2003] NSWCCA 264. 
     
      
    33 However, as was pointed out in Saengsai-Or, the fault element for an offence under s 233B in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Code is intention and this must be proved either by direct evidence or inference. Bell J, with whom and other members of the Court agreed, stated at [74] (my emphasis): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In the appellant’s submission it was necessary for the Judge to direct the jury that proof of intention requires proof that the person meant to engage in the conduct: s 5.2(1). The verbs to “intend” and to “mean” are synonyms. Although it would have been appropriate to incorporate the statutory definition in the directions on intention I do not consider that it was an error not to do so. It is appropriate for a judge in directing a jury on proof of intention under the Criminal Code to provide assistance as to how (in the absence of an admission) the Crown may establish intention by inferential reasoning in the same way as intention may be proved at common law.  
        Intention to import narcotic goods into Australia may be the inference to be drawn from circumstances that include the person’s awareness of the likelihood that the thing imported contained narcotic goods 
        . 
        
       
      
    34 The complaint in the present case is that, although the Judge used terms appropriate to a consideration of an offence to which the provisions of the Code applied, his Honour did not provide assistance as to how the Crown might establish intention but rather directed the jury as a matter of law that, once the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that the marked cartons contained, or were likely to contain, narcotic goods (“the requisite belief”), the offence was proved. It was submitted that the directions were inconsistent with the decisions of the High Court to which reference has already been made. 
     
      
    35 In support of this ground of appeal reliance was placed upon the decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in DPP Reference No 1 of 2004; R v Nguyen (2005) 154 A Crim R 360. That was a decision concerned with the proper directions to give to a jury in respect of an offence of trafficking in not less than a commercial quantity of heroin under ss 71 and 71AA of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act (Vic) 1981. The Court reviewed decisions of the High Court and of this State concerned with the appropriate directions to be given to a jury where an element of an offence is an intention to import or to possess a drug. 
     
      
    36 After reviewing the decisions in Kural, Saad and Pereira and decisions of this Court in R v Greatorex (1995) 83 A Crim R 416, R v Karam (1998) 105 A Crim R 167 and Lau, above, the Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [21] There are, however, some parts of the judgments in Greatorex, Karam and Lau which are of less assistance in the interpretation of ss 71 and 71AA. Each case appears to say that a judge may direct a jury that it is sufficient in itself for the purposes of offences under ss 25 and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for the Crown to prove that the accused knew or believed that there was a significant or real chance that he had drugs in his or her possession. With respect, we do not think that can be so in the case of an offence(s) under ss 71 or 71AA of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act. Presumably there will be many cases under s 71 or 71AA where knowledge of a significant or real chance will support an inference of intention. But it does not follow that it is appropriate to instruct a jury that they may convict simply because the Crown establishes knowledge of a significant or real chance. Kural and Saad make it plain that the existence of the requisite intention is always a question of fact and therefore one for the jury. It is therefore up to the jury whether an inference of intention should be drawn. And the jury must be instructed that an inference is not to be drawn unless they are satisfied that it is the only reasonable inference available in the circumstances of the case. 
         
         
         [22] It follows in our opinion that while a trial judge should direct the jury as to any evidence capable of sustaining an inference of intention for the purposes of ss 71 and 71AA and, depending on the facts of the case, that the judge might also direct the jury that proof that the accused believed or was aware that there was a significant or real chance that his conduct involved trafficking in a prohibited drug in a specified quantity would be something which is capable of sustaining an inference of intention, the judge should at the same time make plain to the jury that it is a matter for them as to whether the evidence leads them to draw that inference and that they should not draw the inference unless satisfied that it is the only inference reasonably open. 
         
         
         [23] In other words, the jury should be directed that in deciding whether the intention to traffick in a prohibited drug in not less than a large commercial quantity has been proved to their satisfaction they should have regard to any direct evidence as to that intention, but might also draw the inference that the accused had such an intention from the circumstances of the case. One such circumstance which would be capable, in itself, of proving the relevant intention would arise if they were satisfied that the accused knew there was a significant or real chance that the trafficking of the prohibited drug in which it has been proved he engaged would involve quantities of the drug not less than a large commercial quantity. Such a conclusion would enable them to draw the inference that the accused had the relevant intention to traffick in a large commercial quantity of the drug. The jury, however, would have to be told that whether they make those findings or draw that inference is a matter for them, and even if the inference is open to be drawn that the accused intended to traffick in a large commercial quantity of the drug, they could not so conclude beyond reasonable doubt if any other inference is reasonably open to be drawn. The jury might then be directed to adopt the same approach when considering, if it proves necessary, whether, in the alternative, intention to traffick in a commercial quantity of the drug has been proved. 
        
       
      
    37 It was submitted that, in accordance with this decision, the trial judge in the present case ought to have directed the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt from all of the circumstances of the case that the appellant intended to take possession of narcotic goods but that one such circumstance that would be capable of proving the relevant intention would arise if they were satisfied that the appellant knew that there was a significant or real chance that the marked cartons contained narcotic goods. It was further submitted that the appropriate direction should also make it clear that it was a matter for the jury as to what inferences should be drawn in the particular case and that any inference should be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    38 It should be noted that the Court of Appeal of Victoria dismissed the appellant’s appeal against conviction, notwithstanding that the Court thought that the directions were “not ideal”. The Court was satisfied that the directions were adequate in all the circumstances of that case. The Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [28]………….Had his Honour done no more than follow the form of words suggested in  
        Lau 
         there may have been a problem. For the reasons already given we consider that that form of words ought not be followed for the purposes of ss 71 and 71AA. But the judge did not stop with the form of words in  
        Lau 
        . Having first given the jury comprehensive instructions on the process of drawing inferences, including an explanation of the way in which the Crown relied upon inference to prove its case, and an express direction that it was not permissible to draw an inference concerning any matter which the jury regarded as constituting a significant part of the process of reasoning unless satisfied that it was the only inference reasonably open, his Honour went on to explain the facts upon which the Crown relied as supporting an inference of actual knowledge or knowledge of a significant or real chance that the quantity was greater than a commercial quantity, and in the course of that process his Honour stressed repeatedly that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant believed that there was a significant or real chance that it could be that volume. 
         
          
         
        [29] In substance, therefore, the only difference between the way in which the judge charged the jury on the question of intent and the way in which we consider with respect that he should have charged them, is that his Honour told the jury that the Crown had to prove knowledge of a significant or real chance that the quantity would exceed a commercial quantity whereas we consider that they should have been told that it was open to infer from proof of that state of knowledge that the applicant intended to traffick in an amount exceeding a commercial quantity. 
         
          
         
         [30] In some cases the difference might be critical. But in the circumstances of this case we do not think it could have made the slightest difference……………… 
         
        
       
      
    39 It is necessary to refer at some length to the trial transcript in the present matter to understand the issue or issues that arose for the jury’s consideration and the content of the Judge’s summing up. During the course of the hearing of the appeal the following passage in the summing up was pointed out to counsel appearing for the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………given the way this trial has been conducted, I do not propose to give you detailed directions on what is an attempt at law, as it is not disputed, if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed when he loaded the three red marked cartons into his van that they contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods, that the accused would be other than guilty of attempting to obtain possession of the narcotic goods that were earlier found concealed in the three cartons. 
         
        
       
       
      Counsel indicated that on his instructions this passage did not accurately reflect the way the trial was fought notwithstanding that there was no objection or complaint to this portion of the summing up raised by defence counsel, a barrister who is experienced in appearing for accused persons charged with drug offences. The Court was informed that evidence would be placed before the Court from defence counsel as to the issues raised and why counsel failed to object to this or any other relevant passage in the summing up. 
       
      
    40 After the Court reserved its decision defence counsel at the trial filed an affidavit. The Crown did not seek to have him cross-examined and did not place any evidence before the Court. The affidavit annexed to it a photocopy of part of the transcript of the debate between the Judge and counsel at the outset of the trial as to the issues that arose for the jury’s determination. Defence counsel asserted that there were errors in the transcript in attributing certain submissions to the Crown when they were actually made by defence counsel. In setting out relevant parts of the transcript I will nominate the speaker in accordance with the transcript as amended by defence counsel. 
     
      
    41 After referring to what was then the recent decision of this Court in Saengsai-Or, the following took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        HIS HONOUR: That case just confirmed that there was only one physical element involved and one fault element; namely intention involved. In that case an intention to import. It seems to me that for similar reasons in this case, the only fault element that arises here is one of an intention to possess the relevant narcotics. So I take it the Crown doesn't take a different view to that? 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : No. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : As I understand too the provision, the aspect about the element concerning that the importation was in contravention of the Act is an element involving absolute liability which requires no intention or any other fault element. Is that right? 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : That's right your Honour and between me and Mr Korn we've obviously discussed it your Honour. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I'd be surprised if you hadn't. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : The only issue is knowledge. 
         
         
        His honour 
        : Knowledge, yes. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : And intention and accordingly that's why the Crown case will be relatively short. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I understand that. But that knowledge question is along these lines, in order for the Crown to succeed, the Crown would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed - - 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Knew or believed, I think, yes. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, correct me if I'm wrong, this is a case where the drugs were I take it removed in part and a controlled delivery took place. So in this situation we're not talking about a possession case, we're talking about an attempt to possess case. The Crown would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, when he collected the boxes or parcels, believed that they contained narcotics goods or believed that there was a likelihood they contain narcotic goods. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Well that latter part is the shorthand of Kural (sic) which your Honour is no doubt - -  
         
         
        His Honour 
        : But Kural dealt with the requisite knowledge required to prove an intention to possess 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : An intention to import. Your Honour - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, no, there were two cases. There was Kural and there was Saad. One dealt with importation the other dealt with possession 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Bari Kur – 1985. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I don't have the case here with me. This was also discussed in cases like Pereira. So you have the two barrelled aspects of knowledge. Knowledge here involves a belief that the boxes or packages, whatever they were, contained narcotic goods or a belief that there was a likelihood that the boxes contained narcotic goods. 
         
         
        Mr Korn 
        : I disagree with that. In fact Bari Kural in fact said knowledge is knowledge and wilful blindness which is what Bari Kural - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, we're not talking about wilful blindness here. 
         
         
        Mr Korn 
        : It's - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, no, I suggest you have a look at the cases again and have a look at Pereira again. 
         
         
        Mr Korn 
        : My position will be, with respect your Honour, that knowledge means knowledge and there’s no constructive knowledge, there’s nothing less than knowledge. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, but I suggest you have a look at the cases again. The cases make it clear that the knowledge aspect involves one of those two beliefs. 
         
         
        Mr Korn 
        : Well I hear what your Honour says. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : That's something that will have to be clarified early on and I suggest that you both have a look at the relevant cases and indeed [Saengsai-or] touches upon this. There was some discussion there about the knowledge. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : There was an import. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : Yes I know, but the question of knowledge is not terribly different. In fact the aspect of knowledge is the same. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : It's never easy your Honour - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : It's not a question of it being easy or not, it's a question of what the situation is. But if you want me to limit the case to simply one of actual belief that it contained narcotic goods, I'm content to do that. If that's the Crown's case, and I won’t introduce this aspect of a belief as to likelihood. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Well all I mean there was belief as to likelihood is a shorthand way of saying that he knew or believed in the sense that there was a real or significant chance that there were narcotic drugs - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : If you have a look at those cases, they say that a likelihood in the way I used it means in the sense that there is some real chance, or something to that effect. It's mentioned in Saad and Kural, I don't have them with me unfortunately, but it specifically explained in those cases as to what likelihood means and its specifically referred to as being a belief that there is a real or significant chance that the relevant objects were or contained narcotic goods. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Those words originally came from a consideration of what is necessary to prove in importation case and the Courts - -  
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no - - 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Well if I can - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : You'll find that one of the cases, and I can't recall which one, it was either Saad or Kural, dealt with importation. The other case dealt with possessing narcotic goods. Each case dealt with this issue. 
         
         
        Korn: 
         Kural dealt with wilful blindness. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I know it's one of the two I can never remember until a look at them which one dealt with the importation in which one was the possession. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : That's the importation case which dealt with wilful blindness. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No this was - Kural dealt with importation right? Saad, then, must have been the case that dealt with possession. Have you got Saad with you? I will just clarify this. I've got the cases up in my chambers, I'll just have my associate retrieve them. Let me just deal with this as quickly as we can……………. 
         
         
        
       
      
    42 It is clear from this passage that the Judge understood that the mental element of the offence was intention to possess the drugs but that, on the basis of the decisions in Kural and Saad, the Crown could make out that element by proving a belief on the part of the accused that the cartons contained or were likely to contain drugs. Defence counsel seems to have thought, erroneously, that the High Court had held that the Crown had to prove nothing less than actual knowledge of the existence of the drugs and that was his stance. However, there was apparently no dispute that, if the Crown proved knowledge of the existence of the drugs, it would prove the offence charged. The only matter in contention was whether something less than knowledge would suffice. 
     
      
    43 The discussion continued. The Judge noted that the only fault element for the offence in accordance with the Code was the fault element of intention and then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        His honour 
        : The physical act is attempting to possess the narcotics. The fault element is the intention to possess the narcotics. In this case in order to do that all the Crown needs to do is to prove belief that there were narcotics in the boxes or there was a likelihood there were narcotics in the boxes. Each of those two beliefs amount to the requisite knowledge. That's my understanding and recollection of those cases. 
         
         
        Crown Prosecutor 
        : Kural which is referred to in [Saengsai-Or] is quoted on page 6 of 19 in the following terms: 
         
         
          
          I will go over what I have said earlier. Actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element required for the commission of the offence. So proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood in the sense that there was a significant or real risk that his conduct involved an act and nevertheless he persisted with that conduct. 
           
           
          
         
        His Honour 
        : That’s the actual knowledge you need. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : That's right. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : That's right, so that's the point I'm making. But also it is more than that because sometimes the person knows or believes that its narcotics. They're not even - they don't have any doubt about it. 
         
         
        Korn 
        : That's right, but with respect are we not all talking about the same thing? Hasn't it always been the case since Bari Kural, and I respectfully say it has, Bari Kural has always said that knowledge is knowledge and wilful blindness and the other - sorry can I just finish, and the other concepts which are used about an evidentiary means of facilitating proof. 
         
         
        His honour 
        : Of an intention to possess. 
         
         
        Korn 
        : Proof. In other words, as your Honour said, there was always the two step process, what is the mental element and how do you go about proving it and practitioners did, from time to time, comments used to. The question of whether there was significant chance or risk was but a means of proving actual knowledge is one and the same thing, it was a means of proof. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : That's right, but in this case the reality is, for practical purposes, that what the Crown has to prove here in order to prove an intention to possess is a belief that the boxes contained narcotic goods or there was a likelihood the boxes contained narcotic goods. That's what the Crown has to prove here. In order to established knowledge and prove intention. 
         
         
        Korn: 
         I'm sorry, with respect your Honour, in my view from the authorities, they are the same thing. It's like saying the word ""leisure"" or ""later"" (sic) in the context both mean the same thing. They are the same test, there is no different test. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : This sort of direction is given in countless cases. In Pereira it was given for example. It's a direction that as far as I know, has been approved for years. The Commonwealth Criminal Code has done nothing to change that. 
         
         
        Korn 
        : I agree, but respectfully the words ""significant or real risk"" is only a means of assisting the jury to understand what the word ""belief"" means. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : No, to understand what ""likelihood"" means. Likelihood is the word that is sought to be explained. 
         
         
        Korn 
        : But likelihood means, likelihood as a means of proving knowledge. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : Its quite clear there in the judgment. I don't think we need to get into this semantic exercise. Just wait for the cases to arrive. 
         
         
        
       
      
    44 It seems to me clear that the Judge was attempting to indicate to defence counsel that, in the case before him and for practical purposes, the Crown could prove intention to possess the drugs by proof of a belief on the part of the appellant that the cartons with the red textra mark contained or were likely to contain drugs. The Judge understood that the existence of the requisite belief was only evidence from which the fault element of intention to possess the drugs could be inferred but that, on the facts of this particular case, that element would be made out if the Crown proved the requisite belief beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    45 It seems that at this point in the discussion the Judge and counsel had some of the relevant decisions. After reading from a passage in the judgment in Saad, the Judge went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        His Honour 
        : ……………….. So essentially what the Crown has to prove here is an intention to possess the narcotic drug. Now what that means from a practical point of view is that the Crown has to prove, because this is not a case of possession, it's a case of attempted possession, that the accused believed that when he picked up these packages, or boxes, whatever they are, he believed that the boxes contained narcotic goods, or that there was a likelihood that the boxes contained narcotic goods. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : A likelihood in the sense of a real or significant chance. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I'm meaning it in the terms that have been explained here in Saad. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : Yes, which means, if I follow, that means likelihood in the sense of a real or significant chance. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : Likelihood meaning in the sense that there was a significant or real chance - - 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : That's right. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : -- that the boxes contained narcotic goods. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : That's right, I agree with that. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : But from a practical point of view, that's really all the Crown has to prove, because it's not disputed that he did have possession of the boxes as I understand it. 
         
         
        Crown prosecutor 
        : I think we've already told your Honour that the one issue in this trial - - 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : I know that, I'm just saying at the end of the day, belief, or if you like, knowledge amounting to believe here as we have discussed is all the Crown really has to prove beyond reasonable doubt and it will either succeed or fail on that basis. In other words in order for the Crown to show an intention to possess what had been removed from the boxes, the Crown essentially has to prove this requisite belief and if they do, they succeed, if they don't, they fail. Do you agree with that? 
         
         
        KorN 
        : As [He Kaw Teh] says, contrary to Bush and [Rawcliffe] you cannot possess something unless you know it's there. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : There's no issue about that, but I wish I could put it as simply as we have raised now in discussions. I'll try and make it as simple as possible for the jury. I have to refer to things like intention to possess and the like in due course. 
         
         
        K 
        or 
        N: Can I just say one thing? My concern has always been and I say this bluntly, we as lawyers might understand that those words about likelihood being a real or significant chance, my concern is, and I don't care with the greatest respect, to who they are, juries, once you hear the expression, knowledge or likelihood, they automatically think that what's being referred to is two alternatives, and that's the problem. Whereas lawyers [who have] in fact greater minds than mine are only trying to help us understand what knowledge is. 
         
        
       
      
    46 In my view at the end of this debate defence counsel accepted, although somewhat begrudgingly, that, based upon the decisions in the High Court, an intention to possess could be proved by the existence of a belief in the presence or likelihood of the presence of drugs in the cartons. Further, he appears to have accepted, or at least not to have dissented from, the proposition put to him directly by the Judge that, on the facts of this particular case, an intention to possess the drugs was made out by proof of a belief that the cartons contained or were likely to contain drugs. He voiced his disapproval of the way the High Court had expressed proof of knowledge and was concerned that the jury might see belief of the likelihood as an alternative to knowledge. 
     
      
    47 In his affidavit filed in this Court, defence counsel said this about the last portion of the transcript set out above: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……..what I am trying to say to His Honour is that my concern is that any reference to the words “likelihood” or “significant or real chance” is that the jury would interpret those words as constituting an alternative test to knowledge and one which is significantly less than knowledge/belief. Whether my then appreciation of the case authorities was in fact correct or not, in the trial I was opposed to his Honour giving a direction to the jury on knowledge/belief which would suggest to them as lay persons, a different and lesser standard of state of mind on the part of my client. 
         
        
       
      
    48 In light of the discussion and the seeming acceptance of the proposition put to defence counsel by the Judge that in this case proof of intention to possess was satisfied by proof of a belief that the cartons contained or were likely to contain drugs, the Judge directed the jury, in the passage earlier quoted, that there was no dispute that, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed when he loaded the three red marked cartons into his van that they contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods, the accused would be guilty of attempting to obtain possession of the narcotic goods. 
     
      
       
      
    49 The Judge also directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As it is not disputed in this trial that the accused intentionally obtained possession of the three red marked cartons in which the narcotic goods were previously concealed, the only real issue for you to determine in this trial is whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused from the time he loaded the three red marked cartons into his van, thereby taking possession of them believed they contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods. The word “likely” in this context means, as I have directed you earlier, that the accused believed there was a real or significant chance they contained narcotic goods. 
         
         
        It is most important that you understand that it is the actual belief of the accused that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt and not the belief of some other person, either real or hypothetical, had that person found himself in the position of the accused. 
         
         
        A suspicion on the part of the accused, falling short of the required belief necessary to establish guilt, is not sufficient to prove guilt. Nothing less than the requisite belief on the part of the accused must be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt before you could find the accused guilty of the offence charged. 
         
         
        Given the way that this trial has been conducted, if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed, from the time he took possession of the three red marked cartons that had previously been found to contain heroin, that is, when he loaded the three read marked cartons into his van, that those cartons contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods, then the Crown will have proved the charge against the accused and you would be obliged to return a verdict of guilty. If you are not so satisfied that the accused had that required belief or you otherwise had a reasonable doubt about it, you would be obliged find the accused not guilty of the charge. 
         
        
       
      
    50 It seems clear to me that the Judge was relying upon that exchange between himself and defence counsel set out in the last quoted passage of the transcript to put the matter to the jury as a concession on the part of defence counsel that the only issue for the jury to decide was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that the cartons contained or were likely to contain the drugs. There was no objection taken to these passages in the summing up. Defence counsel did not raise any suggestion that no such concession had been made or that this was not how the case had been run before the jury. No request was made for any further directions. The complaint by defence counsel was always that the Judge should not leave it to the jury that any thing less than actual knowledge or belief in the presence of drugs in the cartons could give rise to a finding of guilt because nothing less than actual knowledge or belief could prove the necessary intention. 
     
      
    51 Defence counsel explained the absence of objection in the affidavit filed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having been given the opportunity to argue my position to his Honour I took the view that once his Honour determined the matter it was final and therefore not appropriate for me to continue a contrary view. At the end of his Honour’s Summing Up I did not ask for a correction or direction as I continued to have the same view.  
        
       
       
      I do not believe that counsel ever made his position clear once he had stated that “knowledge means knowledge” and that “there is nothing less than knowledge”. Unfortunately he did not assist his argument by introducing the concept of wilful blindness in this regard as wilful blindness was not an issue. The Judge acknowledged that proof of the requisite belief was merely a step in the proof of knowledge and hence the intention to possess the drugs, but he was indicating plainly that on the facts of this particular case, it was sufficient if the Crown proved the requisite belief beyond reasonable doubt. When the Judge put that proposition directly to defence counsel and asked whether he agreed, counsel should have indicated his disagreement in plain terms and the basis of his disagreement. 
       
      
    52 In any event I am content to deal with this matter without applying rule 4. I accept that the summing up might have been technically in error because the Judge did not make it clear to the jury that they could infer the necessary intention if they found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite belief but it was the intention to possess that had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and it was a matter for the jury whether they inferred that the appellant had this intention or not. 
     
      
    53 In my opinion, the decisions of the High Court to which I have referred are still applicable notwithstanding that this was a prosecution to which the Code applied. They simply set out a process of reasoning that the jury might follow in order to find the mental, or fault, element of the offence proved. That process of reasoning seems to me to be as applicable to proof of intention under the Code as to proof of intention under the Common Law. I have already pointed out that this Court in Saengsai-Or accepted that this line of authority was applicable to an offence of importation to which the Code applied. There is no reason in logic or law, that I can see, why it should not also apply to a case of possession or attempted possession of imported goods. 
     
      
    54 The fact that the Code defines recklessness in terms of a circumstance as “an awareness of a substantial risk that the circumstance will exist” is not to the point. As was acknowledged in Saengsai-Or, proof of intention is more difficult for the prosecution than proof of recklessness. In a case where there is some other inference open from a finding of a belief in the likelihood of drugs being present other than that the accused intended to possess the drugs, the Crown will have to negative that inference beyond reasonable doubt before the jury can convict the accused. The fact that in the usual case there will be no other inference available, does not mean that the process of reasoning should not apply under the Code simply because it may have some superficial similarity to how the Code defines recklessness. 
     
      
    55 In the present case what is being asserted is that the trial judge erroneously told the jury that, as a matter of practical reality on the facts and circumstances of the case before the court, intention to possess could be established if: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused from the time he collected the three red marked cartons believed that they contained or were likely to contain narcotic goods. The word “likely” in this context means the accused believed that there was a significant or real chance that the three red marked cartons contained narcotic goods. 
        
       
       
      The directions are said to be inadequate because they failed to make it clear that the jury could infer intention to possess from a finding that the requisite belief had been proved but they did not have to draw that inference and could only draw it if there was no other reasonable inference open on the evidence. 
       
      
    56 An inadequacy in the directions on the elements of an offence is not a fundamental defect in the trial such that the proviso cannot be applied. In Holland v The Queen (1993) 117 ALR 193 the judge had failed to give “any express comprehensive directions” about the elements of the offence of attempt to have sexual intercourse and hence the directions on that offence were inadequate. However, the High Court dismissed the appeal against conviction on the basis that no miscarriage of justice occurred. Mason CJ, Brennan, Toohey and Dawson JJ in their joint judgment at 199-200 wrote (citations omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
         A failure by a trial judge fully to direct the jury about all the elements of an offence does not automatically mean that, in the event of a conviction, there has been a miscarriage of justice. To determine whether there has been a miscarriage, regard must be had to all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the trial. As Dixon, Williams, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ observed in Alford v Magee: 
         
         
          
           ... it may be recalled that the late Sir Leo Cussen insisted always most strongly that it was of little use to explain the law to the jury in general terms and then leave it to them to apply the law to the case before them... He held that the only law which it was necessary for them to know was so much as must guide them to a decision on the real issue or issues in the case, and that the judge was charged with, and bound to accept, the responsibility (1) of deciding what are the real issues in the particular case, and (2) of telling the jury, in the light of the law, what those issues are. If the case were a criminal case, and the charge were of larceny, and the only real issue were as to the asportavit, probably no judge would dream of instructing the jury on the general law of larceny. He would simply tell them that if the accused did a particular act, he was guilty of larceny, and that, if he did not do that particular act, he was not guilty of larceny. 
          
         
        
       
      
    57 In Krakouer v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 202 it was held that a misdirection on an element of an offence was not a fundamental defect in the trial such that the proviso could not be applied in an appropriate case. In the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ their Honour’s wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [24] It may be that a misdirection which has the effect of denying procedural fairness and depriving an accused person of the right to have some substantial part of his or her case decided by the jury would result in a trial that is fundamentally flawed. It may also be that a misdirection about burden of proof invites closer scrutiny of the question whether the trial was fundamentally flawed but in this case it is important to put the particular misdirection into the whole context of the trial. It is convenient to do that at the same time as considering the second branch of the appellant’s argument about the proviso, that the appellant lost a real chance of acquittal. 
        
       
       
      In that case the Court held that it could not be said that by reason of the misdirection the appellant had not lost a chance of acquittal and, therefore, the proviso could not be applied.  
       
      
    58 In R v Guliford (2004) 148 A Crim R 558 a majority of this Court applied the proviso notwithstanding that the directions as to the element of knowledge of the complainant’s lack of consent to sexual intercourse were held to be confusing and incomplete and where they could have led to an impression that the onus of proof was being reversed. 
     
      
    59 It will be recalled that the Victorian Court or Appeal did not quash the conviction in Nguyen notwithstanding that the directions were defective because the Court held that they were adequate in all the circumstances of that case. 
     
      
    60 In the underlined passages quoted earlier from Saad, Kural and Pereira it has been made clear that, as a matter of practical reality, in the ordinary case where the accused has in his possession the container holding the drugs and where the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he believed that there were or were likely to be drugs in the container, the inference of a guilty mind is “irresistible”. So too here, where there was no dispute that the appellant was in possession of the cartons that had contained the drugs, once the jury found that the requisite belief was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the inference of his intention to possess the drugs was irresistible. 
     
      
    61 During argument the appellant’s counsel submitted that this was not an ordinary case as referred to in the passages from the High Court decisions quoted above. When asked what was unordinary about it, he replied that the appellant was asserting that the man Simon duped him. It seems to me with respect to be the quintessential ordinary case: persons who defend importation cases on the basis they did not know that the object imported, or in their possession, contained drugs are always asserting, at least by inference, that they have been duped by whoever it was that wanted the drugs brought into the country. 
     
      
    62 As I indicated earlier, the Crown case to prove the intention to possess the drugs was a circumstantial one. The appellant’s case was in effect that the jury could not draw the inference that he intended to take possession of the drugs beyond reasonable doubt because there was a competing inference available on the evidence. It was argued that the appellant’s conduct was explained by the fact that he had been set up by Simon to test whether the police were aware of the drugs in the cartons. It was his case, from what he said in his recorded interview, that, although he held some vague suspicion about the cartons marked with the red texta, he was unaware of their contents and was only doing what he had been asked to do by Simon. 
     
      
    63 In my opinion, if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he believed that it was likely that the cartons contained drugs, there was no reason for the jury not to infer that he intended to possess the drugs, even for a limited time and for a limited purpose. Such a belief was consistent only with his being guilty of the offence. To my mind it was entirely appropriate in the circumstances of this case for the Judge to direct the jury in terms of the real issue before the jury: whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had the requisite belief. 
     
      
    64 The Judge gave appropriate directions on the onus and standard of proof in relation to a circumstantial case. The jury were directed that a suspicion on the part of the appellant was insufficient. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A suspicion on the part of the accused, falling short of the required belief necessary to establish guilt, is not sufficient to prove guilt. Nothing less than the requisite belief on the part of the accused must be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt before you could find that accused guilty of the offence charged. 
        
       
       
      The Jury were directed on the drawing of inferences and told that, if the inference was reasonably open that the appellant was Simon’s dupe, they must acquit him. 
       
      
    65 In my opinion this is not a case where the Judge’s directions in effect withdrew from the jury’s consideration part of the appellant’s defence or some other critical issue that was for them to resolve: cf Krakouer per McHugh J at 226. Nor did it in any other way deprive the appellant of a chance of being acquitted. 
     
      
    66 Further, I am of the view that the Crown case was an overwhelming one and having reviewed all of the record of the trial I am satisfied that the evidence proved the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt: Weiss v The Queen (2005) 80 ALJR 444 at [43] – [47]. This is simply because I am of the opinion that there was no other reasonable inference open on the evidence other than that the appellant intended to take possession of the drugs that he believed were in the marked cartons. 
     
      
    67 However, the case does point out the importance of trial judges not short-cutting the steps in the line of reasoning by way of inference from proof of a belief in the likelihood of the existence of drugs to proof of an intention to possess the drugs. There will be cases where to do so will have effectively withdrawn an issue from the jury and result in a fundamental flaw in the trial, but this was not such a case. 
     
      
    68 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    3 HOWIE J: On 4 March 2003 the applicant threatened a taxi driver with a knife, placing it against his throat and demanding cash. The driver panicked, raising his hands to protect himself and at the same time accelerated the vehicle. As a result the taxi left the roadway and collided with the front patio of a dwelling house causing it structural damage. The applicant suffered injuries that resulted in his being hospitalised. On 6 March, while still in hospital recovering from his injuries, the applicant admitted to attempting to rob the taxi driver and made admissions of committing a series of attacks upon taxi drivers. He nominated his co-offender who was then arrested. 
     
      
    4 As a result of his admissions to police the applicant was charged with three offences of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, one offence of assault with intent to rob and inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s 98 of that Act, and one offence of armed robbery with wounding also contrary to s 98. The maximum penalty for an offence against s 97 is imprisonment for 20 years and the maximum penalty for a s 98 offence is imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant ultimately pleaded guilty to all offences in the District Court. He also asked the sentencing judge, Judge Knight, to take into account on a Form 1 a charge of take and use a motor vehicle in relation to one of the counts of armed robbery. For each of the armed robbery offences Judge Knight imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of three years, the first of those sentences commencing on 4 March 2003, the second on 4 June 2003 and the third on 4 September 2003. For the offence of assault with intent to rob and inflict grievous bodily harm, the Judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of four years to commence from 4 March 2004. For the offence of armed robbery with wounding, the Judge imposed a non-parole period of four years to date from 4 December 2004 and to expire on 3 December 2008 with a balance of term of three years. The effective total sentence is eight years and nine months with a minimum period to be served of five years and nine months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 3 December 2008. 
     
      
    6 The history of the proceedings against the applicant is as follows. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 10 October 2003 to all of the offences except the robbery with wounding offence and was committed for sentence to the District Court. On 21 October 2003 the applicant was committed for trial on the outstanding charge. The applicant pleaded guilty to all charges before Judge Sides on 7 November 2003. The matter was stood over for the preparation of a presentence report and listed for 6 February 2004. The hearing was further adjourned in order to determine whether there would be an appeal by a co-offender against the sentences imposed upon him. The matter came before Judge Bellear on 6 April 2004 and the sentencing hearing proceeded with the applicant and his mother giving evidence. Judge Bellear reserved his decision but was unable to sentence the applicant by reason of the judge’s ill-health. The matter was then listed before Judge Knight who dealt with the matter on the basis of the transcript of the proceedings before Judge Bellear. The matter was again stood over for the preparation of a further presentence report and this was tendered to the court on 15 September 2004, the date upon which the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    7 The first offence, an armed robbery, was committed on 5 February 2003 when the applicant and his co-offender caught a taxi and directed the driver to a street in Warwick Farm. When they arrived at the destination, the taxi driver became concerned because the applicant appeared to beckon to two males and turned the taxi around. The co-offender alighted from the cab and tried to grab the driver's shirt through the window. The applicant, who was seated in front of the taxi, grabbed the steering wheel and told the driver to stop or he would kill him. The applicant produced a pair of scissors and held them to the victim’s throat, demanding money. When the co-offender referred to grabbing a gun, the taxi driver decamped. The applicant then drove the taxi a short distance before stopping to search it. Having removed the victim's wallet and some money, the applicant then abandoned the taxi. The proceeds of the robbery were used for the purchase of heroin. 
     
      
    8 The second offence, an armed robbery, took place on 20 February 2003 when the co-offender caught a taxi to Warwick Farm. The applicant was waiting for him armed with a metal pole. When the taxi stopped, the applicant put the pole through the driver's window and against the driver’s right ear. The co-offender produced a knife and placed it against the victim's throat. The applicant demanded money and the victim handed over his wallet, his mobile phone, coins and the car keys. The applicant and the co-offender made their getaway in the applicant's motor vehicle that was parked nearby. 
     
      
    9 The third offence, an armed robbery with wounding, occurred on 22nd February 2003. The applicant caught a taxi to Green Valley where the co-offender was waiting. When the taxi stopped, the applicant took out a knife and threatened the driver causing a cut to his jaw. The co-offender approached the driver's side of the taxi with a metal pole and struck the cab trying to gain entry. The victim struggled with the applicant, cutting his hand on the knife. The applicant then placed the knife against the driver's throat and demanded that he open the door. When he did so, the co-offender pushed the pole into the victim’s ribs. The applicant demanded money and the driver's pin number while the co-offender moved the pole to the victim's neck. As a result of the wound to his jaw, the victim received five sutures. 
     
      
    10 The fourth offence, an armed robbery, took place on 26 February 2003. The co-offender caught a taxi to Bankstown where the applicant was waiting. When the taxi stopped, the co-offender produced a knife and held it against the victim's throat demanding money. The victim handed over $200. The co-offender summoned the applicant, who approached with a metal pole and struck the victim hitting his left ear, causing it to bleed. The co-offender searched through the taxi and ultimately the two left with the victim's wallet, cash, mobile phone and keys. 
     
      
    11 The fifth offence, an armed robbery and inflicting grievous bodily harm, took place on 4 March 2003. It was during the commission of this offence that the taxi driver panicked and lost control of the vehicle. The taxi driver suffered a compound fracture to the right knee and a fracture of the right hip. The taxi was completely written off and about $20,000 damage was done to the house. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was 21 years of age at the time of the offences. He was born in Malaysia to parents of Vietnamese origin and who came to Australia as boat people. The applicant enjoyed an uneventful and caring family environment as a child. He completed his High School Certificate and embarked upon a TAFE course in information technology. He worked in a computer store for six months and then as a ticket booth operator with a parking company for about a year. 
     
      
    13 He commenced using drugs in year 11 but ceased the next year. He later commenced using heroin but sought treatment from a medical practitioner in Fairfield. He underwent detoxification at home and used Naltrexone for six months. The applicant was able to avoid further use of heroin for about two years until late 2002. At this time a dispute arose between the applicant's sister and her parents because of a relationship that she had formed with a person of whom her parents did not approve. The applicant found it difficult to deal with the discord and tension at home and started to stay away. At this time he commenced using heroin again. By early 2003 the applicant had become severely dependent on the drug and as a result discontinued his course at TAFE. 
     
      
    14 The applicant had a relatively minor record. In October 2002 he was placed on a bond for possessing a prohibited drug. This bond was current at the time the applicant committed the present offences. 
     
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence before Judge Bellear that he had been avoiding using illicit drugs while in custody and intended to complete his studies on his release. The applicant's mother corroborated the fact that the applicant left home as a result of the dispute between his sister and his parents. She remained supportive of him and was willing to assist him on his release. 
     
      
    16 Judge Goldring sentenced the co-offender on 19 June 2003. He had pleaded guilty to four charges, two armed robberies and two armed robberies with wounding. He had not been charged with the offence of 4 March 2003. He was aged 21 years and had a similar background to the applicant. He had no previous criminal record. He was a friend of the applicant and they used drugs together. The judge gave him a discount for providing information to police, that the judge described as an “Ellis discount” but did not specify the amount by which he had reduced the sentence. The judge also found the co-offender was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. He was sentenced to a total sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 9 months with a minimum period to be served of 4 years 9 months. 
     
      
    17 Judge Knight had the sentencing remarks of Judge Goldring before him. His Honour noted that the co-offender was 5 months younger than the applicant and had no previous record. The Judge also noted that the co-offender was charged with a more serious offence than the applicant was in respect of the fourth count but that applicant had one more offence than the co-offender. He determined that a “slightly heavier overall sentence” was to be imposed upon the applicant. The Judge gave him the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty and indicated that he was taking into account the applicant’s remorse. He noted that, although the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences, he had never been in custody before. He accepted that the offences were committed to obtain money for the purchase of heroin but that the applicant had not used drugs while in custody. The Judge also took into account the delay in sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    18 The first ground of appeal asserts that there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the failure of the Judge to give weight to (a) the assistance given by the applicant to police and (b) the fact that the applicant was in protective custody in prison. 
     
      
    19 Although the matter of assistance provided by the applicant to investigating police was raised in passing during addresses, there was no specific reference by the parties or the Judge to the assistance given by the applicant in revealing the name of the co-offender. This was notwithstanding that the applicant’s legal representative was given an opportunity, prior to the sentence being imposed, to consider the matters that the Judge had indicated he would take into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Certainly there was no reference to this issue during the Judge’s review of the aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A. There had been some reference to it before Judge Bellear but in a somewhat elliptic fashion. 
     
      
    20 The applicant now seeks to rely upon, what is asserted to be, fresh evidence relating to the assistance the applicant gave to investigating police. A letter from a police officer written after sentencing indicates that the applicant was completely truthful, supplied all information requested, and that, without the applicant’s assistance, the co-offender might not have been identified. This evidence is clearly not fresh as it was available to the applicant at the time of sentencing. 
     
      
    21 In the present case there was in the statement of facts before Judge Knight the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 6 March, after speaking with the offender at the hospital where he admitted his and the co-offender’s involvement in the robberies, Police attended the offender’s premises and searched the offender’s car. Located in the boot was a silver, metal pole. Under the front passenger’s seat were two black-handled, kitchen style knives. 
         
         
        The offender’s ERISP: 
         
         
        On being released from hospital the offender was conveyed to Liverpool Police Station. He was interviewed regarding the above offences and readily admitted his involvement 
         
         
        The offender admitted to planning and discussing the details of each of the offences with the co-offender, choosing streets for the offences that were adjacent to alleys and areas facilitating an easy getaway. 
        
       
      
    22 This passage does not make it clear that police were unaware of the identity of the co-offender before being told his name by the appellant. Nor, of course, does it reveal the importance or usefulness of that information. One curious aspect of the present case was that the co-offender received, what the judge described as, an Ellis discount from Judge Goldring to which he was not entitled. Judge Goldring thought, erroneously, that the co-offender was entitled to that discount on the basis that, had the co-offender not made admissions, the Crown might have had difficulty proving its case against him because it was relying upon the evidence of an accomplice. That might be a consideration that goes to the utilitarian value of the plea or even remorse. But it does not give rise to an Ellis discount for the confession of criminality that would otherwise have been unknown to the police. 
     
      
    23 It is unnecessary to determine the basis upon which this Court should receive the new evidence. Ultimately the Crown did not oppose the reception of the evidence. Indeed it went further and revealed for the first time to any court that the applicant had signed a statement indicating his willingness to give evidence against the co-offender. It is of concern that the Crown never revealed this fact at any of the hearings before this. The applicant should be given some benefit for his assistance. But the reduction in the sentence should not be great having regard to the fact that he received a 25 per cent discount for the plea and the Judge took into account that he was remorseful. The offences were of such seriousness that there is a point where no further reduction to the sentence can occur otherwise the sentence would fail to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offences and the requirements of general deterrence. Further there must be a difference between the sentences imposed upon the applicant and his co-offender to reflect the disparity in the total criminality for which they were to be sentenced. 
     
      
    24 The applicant also seeks to rely upon what is said to be fresh evidence in relation to the applicant’s custodial situation. Again the evidence is not fresh as it was available at the time of sentence. His legal representative at the sentencing hearing before Judge Bellear indicated from the bar table that the applicant was “on protection in gaol”. There is no reference to that fact in the Judge’s remarks. Again this is unsurprising since neither of the parties raised the matter with the Judge after they were given time to reflect on the matters that he indicated he was going to take into account by way of aggravation or mitigation. The evidence that the applicant seeks to have admitted is that he was placed on protection after being assaulted on 21 April 2003 and as a result spent part of his sentence in more onerous conditions. 
     
      
    25 Material tendered by the Crown at the hearing shows that the applicant was received into Junee Correctional Centre on 4 October 2004 as a protected inmate. He is housed in the minimum-security area and there is no restriction on any access to services or classification prospects. Therefore any consideration that the applicant is to receive for his time on protection relates to a period of 17 months. 
     
      
    26 The second ground of appeal is that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the disparity between his sentence and that of his co-offender. The only basis for arguing this ground is the fact that the applicant received a sentence longer than his co-offender’s by 12 months and yet the applicant had given assistance, was on protection for a period of his sentence, and the delay before sentencing. 
     
      
    27 It must be borne in mind when considering the issue of parity that the last offence committed by the applicant was a very significant one in respect of the amount of injury, damage and property loss that was directly occasioned by the applicant’s actions in threatening the taxi driver with a knife. In my opinion the sentence imposed upon the co-offender was lenient, as was that imposed upon the applicant. There should be a significant difference in the sentences as between the two men to take into account the added criminality reflected in the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty and the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the time. 
     
      
    28 However in my opinion there should be some small adjustment of the applicant’s sentence to reflect the assistance he gave and the period served in protection, but otherwise the sentences are appropriate. I propose that the sentence for the third count be reduced by six months. Therefore, I would give leave to appeal in respect of the sentence for the third count. I would quash that sentence and in lieu sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months from 4 December 2004 and to expire on 3 June 2008 with a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months to date from 4 June 2008. The applicant would be eligible to be released to parole on 3 June 2008. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      THURSDAY 6 APRIL 2006 
      
    29 THE COURT: Since judgment in this matter was delivered it has been brought to the attention of the Court that there is a disconformity between the sentence pronounced and what was intended. The order of the Court is that the sentence for the third count is quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months from 4 December 2004 and to expire on 3 June 2008 with a balance of term of 3 years to date from 4 June 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I have read in draft the judgment of Simpson J and I agree with her Honour’s conclusion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. I agree with most of her Honour’s reasons for reaching this conclusion but I would like to make some comments of my own. 
     
      
    2 In Simpson J’s judgment her Honour has summarised the facts of the offences, parts of the appellant’s trial and the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Act and there is no need for me to repeat any of those matters in this judgment. 
     
      
    3 In her judgment Simpson J has held that the parts of the statement of Matthew James Gould reading “I heard him (the appellant) say that he was provoked in the male toilets” and the appellant said “I know”, after Mr Gould had asked the appellant to go back to his boat, were not admissible under s 65 of the Evidence Act and not admissible under s 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act; that, nevertheless, the admission of these parts of Mr Gould’s statement did not involve any “wrong decision of any question of law” or a “miscarriage of justice” within s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act; that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required in order that the appellant should be allowed to rely on the first ground of appeal but that leave should be granted; that leave should not be granted to rely on the second ground of appeal or, alternatively, if leave was granted, the ground of appeal should be rejected; and that, alternatively to her Honour’s holding that the admission of the parts of Mr Gould’s statement had not established any ground within s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the appeal should be dismissed under the proviso to s 6(1), that is on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. 
     
      
    4 I agree that the parts of Mr Gould’s statement were not admissible under s 65 of the evidence Act or s 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act, that if leave is required in order that the appellant should be allowed to rely on the first ground of appeal, leave should be granted and that the second ground of appeal should be determined adversely to the appellant and I agree with her Honour’s ultimate conclusion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. However, I would prefer, without expressing an opinion on whether the admission of the parts of Mr Gould’s statement established any ground within s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, to dismiss the appeal on the basis that, assuming that some ground within s 6(1) was established, the proviso to s 6(1) should be applied in favour of the Crown. 
     
      
    5 As I have already indicated, I agree with Simpson J that the parts of Mr Gould’s statement in which he said that “I heard him (the appellant) say that he was provoked in the male toilets” and that the appellant said “I know”, after Mr Gould had asked the appellant to go back to his boat, were not admissible under s 65 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    6 As to the first of these parts of Mr Gould’s statement, it is clear, in my opinion, that the fact, the existence of which the Crown should be taken as having sought to prove by this part of Mr Gould’s statement, was, not that Mr Gould had made a representation, either orally to the police officer who took his statement or in the written statement itself, that he had heard the appellant say that the appellant had been provoked in the male toilets, a fact which would have been irrelevant; and not that the appellant had made a representation to Mr Gould that the appellant had been provoked in the male toilets, a fact which would also have been irrelevant; but that the appellant had in fact been provoked in the male toilets, a fact which was, at least arguably, relevant as being capable of rendering it less likely that the appellant had acted in self defence, as distinct from acting under provocation. 
     
      
    7 However, this part of Mr Gould’s statement was not admissible under s 65 of the Evidence Act to prove that the appellant had in fact been provoked, because, as evidence of that fact, it was not first-hand hearsay but second-hand hearsay and, by virtue of s 62 of the Evidence Act, s 65 is restricted to first-hand hearsay. The evidence of this part of Mr Gould’s statement was evidence of a previous representation made by Mr Gould that a previous representation had been made by the appellant that the fact sought to be proved had happened. 
     
      
    8 The situation in the present case is similar to the situation in Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594, with the appellant corresponding to the appellant Lee in Lee’s case and Mr Gould corresponding to the witness Calin in Lee’s case. 
     
      
    9 The situation in the present case is an example of the form of remote, and not first-hand, hearsay, which was discussed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Evidence Report No. 26 interim (1985) Vol 1 par 678 and by the High Court in Lee at 602-603 (35), where one person A gives evidence of what a second person B said that a third person C had said in order to prove a matter of which only C had first-hand knowledge. In the present case the police officer who gave evidence at the appellant’s trial can be regarded as filling the role of person A, Mr Gould can be regarded as filling the role of person B and the appellant can be regarded as filling the role of person C.  
     
      
    10 This part of the statement was not admissible under Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act as an admission, because by virtue of s 82 evidence of an admission which is not first-hand evidence is not admissible. 
     
      
    11 For similar reasons the part of Mr Gould’s statement stating that the appellant said “I know” was not admissible under either s 65 or Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    12 I agree with Simpson J that Mr Gould’s statement cannot be regarded as having been properly admitted under s 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Mr Gould’s statement was not a “prescribed written statement” within subs (1) of s 289, because, no committal hearing having taken place, neither the whole nor any part of the statement had been admitted or rejected as evidence under Div 3 of Pt 2 of ch 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act and neither the whole nor any part of the statement had been admitted as evidence under Div 5 of Pt 2 of ch 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    13 Section 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act was not mentioned at all, when Mr Gould’s statement was tendered at the trial and its admissibility was argued and it can be inferred that the only basis on which the Crown prosecutor at the trial submitted that the statement was admissible was that it was admissible under s 65 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    14 I seriously doubt whether, even if a statement happens to fall within the definition of “prescribed written statement” in s 289(1), its admission into evidence at a criminal trial can be justified ex post facto on the ground that it was admissible under s 289, if that was not the basis or a basis on which it was tendered. Section 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act imposes certain obligations on a trial judge in admitting a statement under s 289, including determining whether the statement is a “prescribed written statement” within subs (1), whether the trial judge should otherwise order within subs (2) and whether the conditions of admissibility in subs (3) are satisfied. Unless the statement is explicitly tendered on the basis that it is admissible under s 289, the trial judge will not be alerted to the need to discharge these obligations and is unlikely to discharge these obligations. 
     
      
    15 As I have previously indicated, Simpson J considers that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required in order that the appellant should be allowed to rely on the first ground of appeal but that leave under r 4 should be granted. 
     
      
    16 I am also of the opinion that, if leave under r 4 is required, such leave should be granted. However, I would prefer to reserve the question on whether leave under r 4 is required. It is unnecessary for me to decide this question in order to determine the appeal. 
     
      
    17 The question of whether leave under r 4 was required in order for the appellant to be allowed to rely on the first ground of appeal was only very briefly dealt with in argument on the appeal. The only case referred to in the argument was R v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570 and it was the Court which brought this case to the attention of counsel. 
     
      
    18 Plevac is not an entirely satisfactory authority, partly because it was unclear to the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case what had been the extent of counsel for the appellant’s objection at the trial. Furthermore, Plevac was a very different case from the present case. Plevac was a case decided before the Evidence Act came into force and concerned the admissibility of a hearsay statement under the exception to the hearsay rule at common law whereby a statement forming part of the res gestae was admissible. 
     
      
    19 I agree with what Simpson J has written in determining the second ground of appeal and in holding (alternatively) that the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied in favour of the Crown and I have nothing to add to those parts of her Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    20 SIMPSON J: On 16 February 2005 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment charging (i) that he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on Tom Nichols (Count 1) and (ii) that he assaulted Marcus Cross, occasioning to him actual bodily harm (Count 2). On 21 February 2005 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count. 
     
      
    21 On 14 April 2005 Blackmore DCJ sentenced the appellant. On the first count he imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for two and a half years, to be served by way of periodic detention. On the second count he deferred passing sentence conditional upon the appellant entering into a bond pursuant to s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
    22 The appellant now appeals against the convictions. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      the Crown case 
       
      
    23 Each offence was alleged to have been committed late in the evening of 21 December 2003 or in the early hours of the following morning in the Fisherman’s Club at Brighton-Le-Sands. The appellant was a director of the club. He was present at a table drinking with friends. He was behaving in a disruptive fashion. Complaints were made about his behaviour by other patrons, who were present at another table, with the two victims. At about midnight Mr Nichols went to the male toilets. The appellant followed and hit him on the head. This was in retaliation for the complaints made earlier that evening. Mr Cross also entered the toilets and intervened. The appellant poked him in the eye. Mr Nichols was rendered unconscious for a short time. He was assisted by Mr Cross and by a woman who gave evidence in the Crown case, Diedra Murphy. Mr Nichols was bleeding. He was taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery. Mr Cross received medical attention to his eye. 
     
      
       
      the defence case 
       
      
    24 The appellant’s case was that the incident was initiated and provoked by Mr Nichols and that he, the appellant, acted in self-defence. He gave evidence. He claimed that when he went to the toilet a man (who must have been Mr Nichols) already in the toilets made an offensive remark to him, to which he replied equally offensively. He claimed that as he began to urinate the man tackled him, causing him to slide into the trough. The appellant punched the man and pushed him off. This caused the man to hit his head on the wall. Another man, Dave Mitchell, came through the door, followed by Mr Cross. The appellant became “entangled in a bit of a fury of words” with Mr Cross, but did not know that Mr Cross had been poked in the eye. He agreed, however, that there had been “pushing and shoving”, involving himself, Mr Cross and Mr Nichols. He described this as: 
     
      
       
        
        “... a big tangle up between the three of us”. 
        
       
       
      the appeal 
       
      
    25 The grounds of appeal are narrow. Two related grounds are pleaded. Each concerns evidence admitted over objection. This evidence was the content of a statement made to investigating police by a Mathew James Gould, who, it was accepted, was unavailable to give evidence in person. The statement was tendered through a police officer, Senior Constable Edward Taylor. Constable Taylor had not in fact been involved in taking the statement from Mr Gould, but that is immaterial for present purposes. Mr Gould gave an account of the events as he observed them on the evening in question. He identified himself as having been the duty manager at the club on the night of the incident. He said that, at the time, only two groups of patrons were present in the club. One of the patrons had made a complaint about the conduct of the appellant. Mr Gould asked the appellant to return to his “boat” (presumably terminology used in the Fisherman’s Club for the table or area occupied). The appellant replied to this by saying, “I know”. Mr Gould saw another patron (from the other group) walk towards the toilets and saw the appellant also walk towards the toilets. Mr Cross and Mr Mitchell did the same thing. Mr Gould followed. Inside he saw a male patron (plainly Mr Nichols) with his hand covering his left eye. He saw Mr Mitchell pushing the appellant back towards the other side of the room; and heard the appellant say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don’t try to pick me.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Gould told the appellant to leave. He saw the appellant reach behind Mr Gould with his right hand over his left shoulder. Mr Gould turned and saw that Mr Cross had his hand over his left eye. He pushed the appellant out of the toilet block and then returned to the toilet. He saw blood on the hand towel. He observed a five centimetre cut on the left-hand side of Mr Nichols’ forehead, just above his eye. Mr Gould walked towards the guests remaining in the auditorium. He heard the appellant arguing with patrons at Mr Nichols’ table. 
       
      
    26 Mr Gould’s statement then contains the following controversial sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “I heard him [the appellant] say that he was provoked in the male toilets.” 
        
       
      
    27 At the trial objection was taken to the admission of the whole of the statement. Counsel then appearing for the appellant asserted that the statement was tendered by the Crown pursuant to s65(2)(b) and (c) of the Evidence Act 1995. The Crown Prosecutor did not dissent from that assertion. 
     
      
    28 S65 of the Evidence Act applies in a criminal proceeding where a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. (The text of s65 is set out below.) As indicated above, it was common ground that Mr Gould was not available to give evidence about the facts asserted in his statement. S65 operates, in defined circumstances, to permit hearsay evidence (by s59 rendered inadmissible, unless, by one of the exceptions enacted in subsequent provisions, s59 is itself made inapplicable to the particular evidence) to be given in a criminal trial. 
     
      
    29 By s67, s65(2) is inapplicable where the party seeking to adduce evidence thereunder has not given reasonable notice in writing of his or her intention to adduce the evidence. By s67(4) the court may, notwithstanding the absence of notice, direct that s65(2) applies. The effect of s67 is, therefore, that hearsay evidence that would ordinarily be inadmissible by reason of s59, but is made admissible by reason of s65(2), again becomes inadmissible unless reasonable notice has been given, or unless the court exercises the subs(4) discretion to waive the notice requirement. 
     
      
    30 The Crown Prosecutor told the judge that notice had been served, but counsel for the appellant added that notice had been given only four days before the date fixed for the commencement of the trial. He then put an argument against admission of the evidence based only upon discretion. He gave a number of reasons why the discretion should be exercised against the admission of the statement. The transcript records him as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was late notice and we have never cross-examined Mr Gould, there was no committal proceedings, obviously, having been, this matter having gone straight to trial, and when the matter was, the paper committal there was no mention of the unavailability of one of the witnesses. There were also, on my instructions, things that I wanted to put to Mr Gould which ... assist the defence case and his unavailability would leave up in the air, it will be a one-sided – I shouldn’t use the word ‘one-sided’. All you have is a statement being read to the jury and that’s the end of it.” 
        
       
      
    31 It is to be observed that no objection was taken on the basis that the evidence did not come within s65(2). Objection was taken solely on the basis that reasonable notice had not been given, and that, for discretionary reasons, the evidence ought, in any event, be excluded. Presumably by these submissions counsel intended to invoke all or any of ss67(4), 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. It remains the case in this Court that no contention is made that the evidence does not come within s65(2). 
     
      
    32 After consideration Blackmore DCJ admitted the statement. He gave reasons for doing so. He considered, firstly, the impact of the late notice, and came to the view that earlier notice would not have made any, or any significant, difference. He held that the notice given was, in the circumstances, not unreasonable. 
     
      
    33 He then turned to the other discretionary factors mentioned, and observed that he had not been told what the “things” were that counsel wanted to put to the witness. He considered that the evidence from Mr Gould about the appellant’s demeanour on the night of the events was potentially important, and that his evidence would “clearly” be an important aspect in the jury’s assessment as to who was the aggressor. In this respect he noted his understanding that the appellant proposed to rely upon self-defence as an answer to one, if not both, of the charges. He considered that Mr Gould had been shown, on the evidence already admitted, to be an important eye-witness to the events and that, even if the appellant denied the conversations with him asserted by Mr Gould, that would not affect Mr Gould’s observations (of events and conduct). He concluded that the evidence should be before the jury so that they could adequately address the issues in the case. He noted that, on admission of the evidence, he would give a direction in accordance with s165 of the Evidence Act. He stated that he had considered ss135, 137 and 192 of the Evidence Act and determined that the evidence would be admitted and that any unfairness could be addressed by a direction. He in fact did, immediately, give such a direction. 
     
      
    34 Once his Honour had determined to admit the statement, no further discussion about its content took place. No objection was taken by counsel to the admission of any discrete part of the statement on any ground. All involved proceeded on the basis that, the two bases of objection (absence of adequate notice, and prejudice arising from the inability to cross-examine) having been determined adversely to the appellant, the whole of the statement would be admitted. 
     
      
    35 On this appeal it was not contended that Blackmore DCJ erred in the approach he took to the issues that were aired before him, or in the exercise of his discretion in admitting the statement. 
     
      
    36 The grounds of appeal as pleaded were not directed at the whole of the statement. They were concerned only with that sentence in the statement in which Mr Gould said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I heard him say that he was provoked in the male toilets.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal were framed as follows: 
       
       
        
        “1. The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the prior representation of Mathew Gould that he heard the appellant say ‘ 
        that he was provoked in the male toilets’. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to adequately warn the jury of the danger of relying on the evidence of Mr Gould in relation to the admission alleged to have been made by the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    37 At a late stage during the hearing of the appeal leave was sought to widen the first ground by including complaint also about the admission of the evidence of the conversation in which Mr Gould claimed to have asked the appellant to return to his “boat” to which, he said, the appellant replied, “I know”. 
     
      
       
      ground 1 – admission of evidence 
       
      
    38 As will be apparent from the manner in which the first ground of appeal is framed, no point is taken in relation to the admission of the evidence as it was argued before and decided by Blackmore DCJ. The only issues raised before his Honour were those I have already identified: late notice and the lack of opportunity to cross-examine Mr Gould. No error is asserted in the way his Honour dealt with that issue, or in his conclusion. At no point was any individual part of the statement the subject of objection. Nor was either of the parts of the statement now the subject of appeal the subject of any separate submission – for example, that counsel wished to cross-examine Mr Gould in relation to that part of the statement, or indeed to challenge him as to the accuracy of that part of the statement. It may well be that, had separate objection been taken at the trial to either of those portions of Mr Gould’s statement now the subject of objection, either or both would have been excised. 
     
      
    39 At the outset of the appeal counsel for the Crown was asked to specify what it was that the Crown sought to prove by the tender of that part of Mr Gould’s statement in which he attributed to the appellant the assertion that he had been provoked. The reply was that the evidence constituted an admission on the part of the appellant (i) that he had struck Mr Nichols, and (ii) that he had done so in circumstances in which no attack had been made upon him by Mr Nichols. (I have serious reservations about whether that part of the statement can fairly be taken to convey the second of these meanings, but this ground of appeal can be decided upon acceptance of Mr Crown’s interpretation.) 
     
      
    40 On behalf of the appellant it was argued that the statement attributed to him, that he was provoked, was second-hand hearsay, and rendered inadmissible by reason of s82 of the Evidence Act, and on the analysis of the High Court in Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; 195 CLR 594. (The same argument would apply to that part of the statement later included in the ground of appeal in which the appellant was said to have replied, “I know” to Mr Gould’s request that he return to his “boat”. In my opinion, in this context, those words should be interpreted as an acknowledgment on the part of the appellant that his behaviour to that point had been unacceptable, so as to justify Mr Gould’s request that he return to his “boat”. In any event, that appears to be the basis upon which the Crown contends that that part of the statement was admitted under s65(2).) The Crown argued to the contrary, contending that the evidence was not second-hand hearsay, and not inadmissible. 
     
      
    41 It is therefore necessary to consider in some detail the hearsay provisions of the Evidence Act. These principally appear in Part 3.1. 
     
      
    42 The starting point is s59. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        59 The hearsay rule—exclusion of hearsay evidence 
          
         
         
        (1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. 
         
         
        (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an  
        asserted fact 
        .” 
         
        
       
      This exclusionary rule is, as the heading indicates, known as “the hearsay rule”. 
       
       
      “Representation” is defined in the Dictionary, relevantly, as including: 
       
       
        
        “(a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing) ...” 
        
       
       
      A “previous representation”, also defined in the Dictionary, is: 
       
       
        
        “a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced.” 
        
       
      
    43 In the sections which succeed s59 are enacted a series of exceptions and qualifications thereto. Those presently relevant are: 
     
      
       
      (i)  
      s60 
      , which provides: 
       
       
        
        “ 
        60 Exception: evidence relevant for a non-hearsay purpose 
          
         
         
          
          The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation”; 
          
         
        
       
      (ii)  
      s65 
      , which, in subs(1), is expressed to apply in a criminal proceeding where a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact, and which relevantly provides: 
       
       
        
        “(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
         
          
           
          (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or  
           
           
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or  
           
           
          (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or  
           
           
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made”; 
          
         
        
       
       
      (iii)  
      s66 
      , which, in subs(1), is expressed to apply in a criminal proceeding where a person who has made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact, and which relevantly provides: 
       
       
        
        “(2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 
         
         
          
          (a) that person, or  
           
           
          (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made,  
           
          if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    44 By s62 the exceptions provided in Division 2 of Part 3.1 are restricted to evidence that is “first-hand” hearsay. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        62 Restriction to “first-hand” hearsay 
          
         
         
        (1) A reference in this Division (other than in subsection (2)) to a previous representation is a reference to a previous representation that was made by a person who had personal knowledge of an asserted fact.  
         
         
        (2) A person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if his or her knowledge of the fact was, or might reasonably be supposed to have been, based on something that the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived, other than a previous representation made by another person about the fact.” 
        
       
      
    45 Admissions are a specific species of hearsay evidence. “Admission” is defined in the Dictionary as: 
     
      
       
        
        “... a previous representation that is: 
         
         
        (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and  
         
         
        (b) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    46 By s81 evidence of admissions is excepted from the hearsay rule; by s82, the exception provided by s81 is itself the subject of exception unless the evidence of the admission is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made. (This is commonly referred to as a prohibition on evidence of an admission by second-hand hearsay.) 
     
      
    47 It is convenient here also to refer to ss55 and 56. By s56(1), except as otherwise provided by the Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding; by subs(2), evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible. 
     
      
    48 S55(1) defines “relevant evidence” as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) ... evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    49 At this point it is convenient to be more precise about the characterisation of Mr Gould’s statement. The statement was, in reality, a series of linked representations made by Mr Gould. It may be assumed that he made the representations orally to a police officer, and that he made them in writing when, by signing the statement, he adopted them. As noted above, the statement was tendered through Senior Constable Taylor, although Senior Constable Taylor had not been present at the time the statement was taken. Sensibly, no point was taken that Senior Constable Taylor had not seen, heard or otherwise perceived Mr Gould making the representations; there was no issue that the statement (that is, each individual representation) had, in fact, been made to the other police officer who had accordingly seen, heard or otherwise perceived Mr Gould making the representations, and could, accordingly, (provided that the individual representations were relevant) have given evidence to that effect. Notionally, therefore, the hearsay evidence that was given and that was admitted under s65(2) was the evidence of Senior Constable Taylor (standing in for the officer to whom the statement had been made) that he had heard (and/or seen) Mr Gould make a series of representations made admissible by s65(2). 
     
      
    50 It is then necessary to consider the nature of the evidence now the subject of controversy. I will begin with the statement initially the only subject of the ground of appeal – that the appellant said that he had been provoked, (and continuing to accept the interpretation placed upon it by the Crown). The same principles will, of course, apply to the other evidence, but it will be necessary to consider it separately. 
     
      
    51 The first task is to identify the “previous representation” sought by the Crown to be admitted under s65(2); that will necessarily identify the person by whom the representation is said to have been made. The second task is to identify the “fact” that person intended to assert in the representation. The third task is to identify a fact in issue, or a fact relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings, the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence. 
     
      
    52 There are, in fact, two previous representations and it is important to distinguish between them. One is the representation made by Mr Gould that he heard the appellant say that he had been provoked. That was an express oral representation made by Mr Gould to, and heard by, the police officer who took his statement; alternatively (or additionally), it was an express written representation made by Mr Gould and seen or perceived by the police officer who took, and witnessed, the statement. The other representation is the representation contained in the words attributed by Mr Gould to the appellant, that he had (in fact) been provoked. On the face of Mr Gould’s statement, this was an express oral representation made by the appellant and heard by Mr Gould. This latter representation was relied upon by the Crown as an admission by the appellant – that is, a representation made by the appellant adverse to his interest in the outcome of the proceedings. 
     
      
    53 The question which then arises, pursuant to s59, is what fact or facts Mr Gould intended to assert by his representations. His representation that he had heard the appellant say that he (the appellant) had been provoked was no more than that – that is, a representation that Mr Gould had heard the appellant say that he had been provoked. Mr Gould did not intend to assert any more than that. He did not intend, and was not in a position, to assert that the appellant had in fact been provoked (or, if he did, it was beyond his capacity to do so, because it was outside his knowledge). It was the appellant’s representation that was intended to assert that fact. 
     
      
    54 If the fact that the appellant had said that he had been provoked (as distinct from the fact that the appellant had been provoked) were relevant, then (subject to any other relevant provision of the Evidence Act, or any other impediment), s65(2) would have rendered the evidence contained in that part of the statement admissible. But the fact that the appellant said that he had been provoked was not relevant to any issue in the trial; it could have been relevant only if it could also be used in proof of the truth of what the appellant had said. 
     
      
    55 Counsel for the Crown sought, in a sense, to retreat from his earlier specification of what the statement attributed by Mr Gould to the appellant was said to prove. He expressly sought to rely upon Mr Gould’s statement as evidence that the appellant had in fact been provoked. 
     
      
    56 The identification at the commencement of the appeal by the Crown of what was sought to be proved by the statement attributed to the appellant is, in my view, the correct characterisation. That is, the Crown tendered, and sought to rely upon, that statement as evidence that the appellant had struck Mr Nichols and had done so in the absence of any attack by Mr Nichols upon him. That was, in my view, plainly impermissible. In my opinion, the case is indistinguishable from Lee, to which I will shortly come. The evidence contained in Mr Gould’s statement of what the appellant had said was inadmissible. I repeat, that was because it was not relevant to prove the fact that the appellant had said he was provoked (with the connotation placed upon that statement by the Crown); it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant had struck Mr Nichols, without having first been struck by Mr Nichols; and to seek to prove that through the appellant’s statement heard by Mr Gould was, in these circumstances, to seek to prove it impermissibly through second-hand hearsay. 
     
      
    57 The same, in my opinion, applies to that part of Mr Gould’s statement in which he asserted that, on being asked to return to his “boat”, the appellant had said “I know”. Although those words may appear to lack clarity, they ought, in the circumstances, and contrary to the submission of the Crown, to be interpreted as an admission or acknowledgment that his conduct had been such as to justify the request made by Mr Gould. (The construction sought to be placed by the Crown upon the appellant’s answer was that it was merely an acknowledgement that he had been spoken to by Mr Gould.) On the interpretation that I favour, that part of Mr Gould’s statement was also tendered to prove the truth of the fact that the appellant had intended to assert. As with the statement about his having been provoked, Mr Gould’s statement was inadmissible to prove that fact. 
     
      
    58 Either could have been proved through oral evidence given by Mr Gould, had he been available; what was not permissible was to prove either through the hearsay statement of Mr Gould, via the evidence of a police officer. 
     
      
    59 The “previous representation(s)” which s65 rendered admissible was (were) here (subject to relevance) the previous representation(s) made by Mr Gould. It was not the representation (as to his conduct) attributed to the appellant. This was precisely the situation that pertained in Lee. What was held in that case is summarised accurately in the headnote in the Commonwealth Law Report. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “... s60 did not permit an out of court statement which was itself a report of what another had said to be used as proof of the truth of what was reportedly said, and, accordingly, that evidence of the out of court statement was not admissible as evidence of the truth of the confessional statement.” 
        
       
      
    60 The issue in Lee arose in different circumstances, but the reasoning in that case is equally applicable to the present. 
     
      
    61 There, a witness had made a statement to police in which he attributed to the accused person certain representations of a confessional character. When the witness was called in the accused person’s trial to give evidence, including evidence of those confessional representations, he claimed to have no recollection of such a conversation. The Crown sought leave to cross-examine the witness in order to elicit evidence of what he had told police, and tendered oral evidence through two police officers, and documentary evidence in the form of a statement signed by the witness, of what the witness had attributed to the accused. The ultimate objective of the Crown was to prove, not that the accused person had made the confessional representations, but that the confessional representations were true. That is precisely what the Crown here seeks to do. The cases are indistinguishable. 
     
      
    62 The exception to the hearsay rule that was relied upon in Lee was s60, which excludes the application of the hearsay rule to evidence that is admitted for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation: in that case the purpose for which evidence of the witness’ representations was tendered was to show that the witness had made a prior inconsistent statement and that his credibility was thus affected [28]. To that extent the witness’ previous representations were admissible, through evidence given by a person who heard him make them. But the exception provided by s60 applied only to the previous representations made by that witness; it did not also apply to the previous representations said to have been made to the witness by the accused person. S82 precluded the admission of evidence of previous out of court statements made by the witness, that the accused person had made those representations. It would not have precluded evidence being given by the witness in court that the accused person had made those representations. 
     
      
    63 That the exception there relied upon was the s60 exception, and not the s65 exception here relied upon, is immaterial. The High Court made it clear that evidence of an out of court representation by one person cannot be given by the out of court representation of another person. That is, however, what the Crown here seeks to establish. It cannot be done. 
     
      
    64 The present case neatly illustrates another point made by the High Court in Lee, at [32] – [35] concerning the reforms made by the Evidence Act to the common law hearsay rule. The Court pointed out that those reforms are limited (to permitting first-hand hearsay), and the reason for that limitation. That reason is the inherent unreliability of second-hand hearsay, affected as it is by the honesty and accuracy of the recollections of the person who is said to have heard, seen or otherwise perceived the making of the original representation, but who does not himself, or herself, actually give evidence. Here, if Mr Gould’s previous representations as to what he heard the appellant say were to be admitted, there was no way that his honesty or accuracy could be tested or could be evaluated by the jury. What would not be known would be his position in relation to the appellant at the time the appellant was said to have made the statements, the ambient noise, and any other distractions that might have affected his capacity accurately to capture what the appellant said. Those matters could be tested if he gave the evidence himself orally, but could not, in the circumstance that his account was given by the hearsay evidence of another witness, or in documentary form. 
     
      
    65 Part 3.1 of the Evidence Act was designed and intended to relax the old common law prohibition on the admission of hearsay evidence. It was not designed or intended to abolish the prohibition altogether or to render remote (and therefore potentially extraneous and unreliable) hearsay statements admissible. It was intended to contain a brake upon the relaxation of the common law hearsay rule; that brake is contained in s82. It operates on the evidence here in question. That evidence was inadmissible. 
     
      
       
      Criminal Appeal Rules, rule 4 
       
      
    66 On the hearing of the appeal an issue arose as to whether, having regard to the provisions of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, the appellant requires leave before being permitted to argue the admissibility of the evidence as a ground of appeal. 
     
      
    67 Rule 4 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        No 
         direction, omission to direct, or  
        decision as to the admission 
         or rejection  
        of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal 
         or an application for leave to appeal  
        unless objection was taken at the trial 
         to the direction, omission or  
        decision by the party appealing 
         or applying for leave to appeal.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    68 On behalf of the Crown it was contended that no relevant objection had been taken at the trial, and that the appellant therefore required leave to raise the ground, and that leave ought to be refused. Counsel for the appellant agreed that, objection to the whole of the statement having been taken, the conditions of Rule 4 had been met, and that leave was not required. 
     
      
    69 That raises an important issue as to the scope of rule 4. 
     
      
    70 What happened in the present case, as I have earlier outlined, was that counsel for the appellant objected, on discretionary grounds, to the admission of the whole of Mr Gould’s statement. He did not at any stage argue that it, or any part of it, was not admissible under s165(2); he argued, presumably invoking the judicial discretions conferred either by s67(4) or s135, that the evidence ought to be excluded. He also appears obliquely to have relied upon s137. Neither s67(4) nor s135 is a section directed to admissibility – each is a section reserving a discretion to the court to exclude evidence of the character identified. S137 is, properly characterised, a section directed to admissibility. The nearest counsel could be said to have come to an argument that the evidence was inadmissible was to put to the trial judge matters that might be construed as raising s137, pursuant to which (in a criminal case), if a court is of the view that the probative value of a particular piece of evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendants, then the court is obliged to exclude that evidence – that is, once the judgment is made that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, then s137 renders the evidence inadmissible. 
     
      
    71 In fact, counsel never drew attention to, or even mentioned, any of these sections. The legal foundation on which he put his objection has to be divined from the rather cryptic submissions he made. 
     
      
    72 Once the decision had been made that those objections failed, he made no further objection as to the admissibility of any individual part of Mr Gould’s statement. 
     
      
    73 Nevertheless, counsel for the appellant argued in this Court that, once objection is taken, rule 4 has no further application. That is, that once objection – that is, objection of any kind, and on any basis - is taken on any ground to a particular piece of evidence, then rule 4 will not operate to prevent the raising of an entirely different objection to the same piece of evidence. 
     
      
    74 To accept the appellant’s contention would be to cast an extraordinary burden upon trial judges. It not infrequently happens that evidence, whether oral or documentary, is tendered, and objection is taken to the whole of the evidence of a witness, or of a document. An obvious example is an electronically recorded interview with the person subsequently charged. These frequently are extremely lengthy documents. On the appellant’s argument, if objection were taken to the whole of such an interview, on the ground, for example, that it was not voluntary, and, if that objection were resolved against the accused, and no subsequent objection taken to any individual part of the interview, it would, nevertheless, be incumbent upon the trial judge (at the risk of falling into appellable error) to determine the admissibility of every individual answer given in the interview. The judge would be required to take that course without knowing the contents of the brief (at least of counsel for the accused), and frequently without having been enlightened as to the true issues in the proceedings. The proposition only needs to be stated to be seen as untenable. 
     
      
    75 There are, however, some passages in the authorities said to support the contention of counsel for the appellant. One such is R v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570, a decision to which I was a party. There, in a joint judgment, this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an objection was indeed taken, although counsel may not have formulated the basis thereof as precisely as might have been expected, leave to argue this ground is not required. If, on the other hand, and as appears more likely, no objection was taken, leave is required:  
        Criminal Appeal Rules,  
        r4.” 
        
       
       
      The Court in that case did not find it necessary to determine the application of rule 4, holding that the error there identified was fundamental and of such potential significance that, if necessary, leave ought to be (and was) granted to argue the point. 
       
      
    76 I cannot accept the appellant’s proposition. S6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides for a number of grounds of appeal, including, relevantly “the wrong decision of any question of law”, and “that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. The contention of the appellant is that the evidence was wrongly admitted. Admission of evidence involves a question of law. The appellant must be taken to be raising a ground that the decision to admit the evidence involved the wrong decision of a question of law. Judges decide questions that are put before them by the parties for determination. In Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297, with reference to rule 4, McHugh J commented that, where objection has not been taken at trial, the trial judge cannot be said to have made an error of law, because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. That reasoning is equally apposite where, as here, a relevant ruling has not been sought. The question that was put before Blackmore DCJ for determination was whether, in the exercise of his discretion, he should reject the whole of Mr Gould’s statement. Since the questions under s165(4) and s135 involved discretionary determinations, those determinations may only be reviewed on appeal on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The question under s137 involves an evaluation, the result of which dictates whether the evidence is or is not admissible. That evaluation too, may only be reviewed on the principles stated in House. If the grounds established that (and they obviously do not), it would be open to the appellant here to argue error of law in the determination not to reject the whole of the statement under ss67(4), 135 or 137. Yet the appellant now seeks to argue, not that there was any House-type error in the exercise of discretion, or in the s137 evaluation, but that two parts of the statement were not admissible by reason of the provisions of the Evidence Act. This is a far cry from the objection that was taken at the trial. The judge has made no error of law in that respect, because is was never put before him for determination. 
     
      
    77 I recognise that on one very literal construction of the words in rule 4, the appellant might draw some comfort. However, closer analysis of the rule strips that comfort away. The “decision” in question was not a decision (made over objection) that the two passages now in contention were admissible evidence; such a decision was never made, because the judge was never called upon to make such a decision. The decision he made was a decision, made after consideration of discretionary matters, and evaluation, that Mr Gould’s statement, in its entirety, would be admitted. 
     
      
    78 In my opinion, the appellant requires leave under rule 4 if he is to be permitted to argue this ground. In the unusual circumstances of this case, I would grant leave. As I have indicated, I am of the view that the particular passages in the statement were inadmissible. That does not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that the ground should succeed. 
     
      
    79 The statement that the appellant said that he had been provoked, even if construed as contended for by the Crown had, in my opinion, little, if any, significance. No reference was made to it in the addresses of either counsel, or by the judge in summing up. As I have indicated above, I have doubts about the interpretation proposed by the Crown of the words or the interpretation that the jury, unaided by any submissions about what should be read into the words, would have placed upon them. This Court did not receive any contrary submission on behalf of the appellant; it was not, on appeal, in his interests to accept a benign interpretation. The substance of the evidence (as interpreted by the Crown) was in evidence from other sources: for example, a witness called Graham Watson, who was called in the prosecution case, said in his evidence-in-chief that, on the day after the incident, he encountered the appellant who mentioned the events of the previous evening and said that while he was in the toilet: 
     
      
       
        
        “... a bloke walked up behind him and he turned around and kicked him in the head and then urinated on him.” 
        
       
      
    80 When asked further questions in chief, Mr Watson said that it was the appellant who urinated on the other man. In cross-examination he confirmed that he had said that the appellant told him that somebody had walked up behind him; he then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... I said that Brett Vickers told me that someone walked up behind him and went to hit him, he spun around and kicked him in the head and then urinated on him.” 
        
       
      
    81 While Mr Watson’s evidence was not always clear, this answer did make it clear that the representation that he attributed to the appellant was that another person – Mr Nichols – had initiated the violence, and that the appellant had reacted. In one sense this evidence was more damaging to the appellant than the controversial sentence in Mr Gould’s statement because it detailed a far greater level of violence on the part of the appellant; on the other hand, so far as it dealt with the question of who initiated the violence, it favoured the appellant’s account. 
     
      
    82 Even the phraseology of the contested passage did not seriously cut across the case the appellant sought to make – that it was Mr Nichols who was the aggressor. Indeed, it seems to me that the passage in Mr Gould’s statement is consistent with the defence advanced by the appellant himself – that he responded to an attack upon him. True it is, on one interpretation of what Mr Gould attributed to the appellant, he acknowledged something of an overreaction, but this, in the light of the evidence Mr Watson had given, could not have done him any more harm. No attention was paid to, or reliance placed upon, the disputed words in the address of the Crown Prosecutor in the address of defence counsel, or in the summing up. The words effectively disappeared without trace. 
     
      
    83 Even less were the words “I know” attributed to the appellant by Mr Gould of significance. They, also, were simply never mentioned by counsel or by the trial judge. 
     
      
    84 There was no error of law in the admission of either passage. The admission gave rise to no miscarriage of justice. There is then no basis under s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act to allow the appeal in this respect. Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      ground 2 - directions 
       
      
    85 No application was made to the trial judge for directions of any kind in relation to the disputed passage in Mr Gould’s statement. Accordingly, there is no issue that leave under rule 4 is required if the appellant is to be permitted to rely upon this ground. 
     
      
    86 Immediately after reading Mr Gould’s statement to the jury, Blackmore DCJ gave a strong direction pursuant to s165 of the Evidence Act. His Honour exhorted the jury to be cautious in respect of the evidence; he told them that the evidence was potentially unreliable in a number of respects, which he identified. He pointed out that Mr Gould was not available to be cross-examined; that his statements had been taken down, presumably by a police officer and so there was no certainty whether the words on the page were the precise words used by Mr Gould or whether it was “a compilation” of the words of the police officer and Mr Gould; and he pointed out that it was not a statement on oath or affirmation. He therefore told the jury that the statement may be unreliable and repeated that the jury needed to be cautious in using it. 
     
      
    87 His Honour repeated these warnings in the summing up. 
     
      
    88 The complaint that is now made is that the very strong warnings given related to the whole of the statement and were not directed to the particular passages now under consideration. 
     
      
    89 On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that, specifically in relation to the “I was provoked” passage, the judge should have warned the jury: 
     
      
    - that the part of the statement complained of was not only hearsay, but second-hand hearsay; 
     
      
    - that the words attributed to the appellant were not in direct speech and may not have been his precise words; 
     
      
    - that the statement attributed to the appellant was not made directly to Mr Gould but was overheard by him and his capacity accurately to hear (by reason of distance, orientation, and background noise) were not known; 
     
      
    - that evidence of an admission is easily fabricated and not easily disproved and the motive for fabrication will not always be apparent, even to the accused person; 
     
      
    - that the admission, if made, may have related either to the conduct giving rise to count 1 or to count 2; 
     
      
    - that two important prosecution witnesses did not support the making of the admission. 
     
      
    90 In my opinion, ground 2 fails. The directions given in relation to the whole of the statement were perfectly adequate to draw to the jury’s attention any potential unreliability in Mr Gould’s statement, including those parts of it now held to have been inadmissible. 
     
      
    91 I would not grant leave to argue this ground; if leave were granted, I would reject the ground. 
     
      
       
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      , s289(1)(b) 
       
      
    92 In relation to Ground 1, an alternative response was put on behalf of the Crown, to the effect that, had objection been taken to the admissibility of the whole of the statement under s65 of the Evidence Act, (as distinct from the objections that were taken, that relied, essentially, upon discretionary matters) it would have been open to the Crown to tender the statement under the provisions of s289(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    93 S289 relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “289 Written statement admitted in committal proceedings 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to:  
         
          
           
          (a) a written statement the whole or any part of which has been admitted as evidence under Division 3 of Part 2 of Chapter 3, including any part of the statement that has been rejected under that Division, 
           
          (b) a written statement the whole or any part of which has been tendered as evidence under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3, 
          
         
         
         referred to in this section as a “ 
        prescribed written statement” 
        . 
         
         
        (2) Except in so far as the court otherwise orders, a prescribed written statement may be admitted as evidence for the prosecution at the trial of the accused person on proof on oath that the person who made the statement:  
         
          
           
          (a) is dead, or so ill as not to be able to travel or to give evidence without a risk of endangering the person’s life, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) is absent from Australia. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        6) If at a trial it appears to the court that the whole or any part of a prescribed written statement is inadmissible, the court may reject the statement or that part, as the case may be, as evidence.” 
        
       
      
    94 S68 of the Criminal Procedure Act (which appears as part of Chapter 3, Part 2, Division 2, concerning “committal proceedings generally”) provides: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “Accused person may waive committal hearing 
         
         
        68 Despite any other provision of this Part, the Magistrate may, at any time, on the application of the accused person, and with the consent of the prosecutor, commit the accused person for trial.” 
        
       
      
    95 Division 3 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act appears under the heading “Prosecution Evidence” and contains detailed provisions concerning the prosecution evidence to be given in committal proceedings in respect of indictable offences. Division 5 appears under the heading “Procedure if accused person pleads guilty” and is not presently material. 
     
      
    96 It will be appreciated from the clear words of s289(1)(a) that the admissibility in a trial of a prescribed written statement provided for in s289(2) depends upon that prescribed written statement having been admitted, in whole or in part, as evidence under Chapter 3, Part 2, Division 3. 
     
      
    97 This Court was provided with an affidavit affirmed by Ms Philippa Winston, a solicitor employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Ms Winston researched the files and material relating to the committal proceedings in relation to the charges faced by the appellant. That evidence shows that, on 22 July 2004, the appellant made an application under s68 to waive his right to a committal hearing in respect of the charges, and the prosecution consented to the application. An order was accordingly made by the Magistrate in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I order the Accused Person to be committed to trial to the District Court at Sydney and to appear before such Court on 30th day of July 2004.” 
        
       
      
    98 Since that order obviated the need for any committal proceeding, it seems clear that no statements, including that of Mr Gould, were “admitted” under Chapter 3, Part 2, Division 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. S289(2) was therefore not activated and, in my opinion, Mr Gould’s statement could not have been admitted under that section in the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
    99 I am conscious of the considerable ramifications which might attach to this view. Strictly speaking, because Mr Gould’s statement was not, at trial, tendered under s289, it is not necessary to decide this issue raised by the Crown. However, the argument was put, and the consequences are potentially so significant, that I have come to the view that I should at least express the view I have reached. That is, that where a person accused of an indictable offence under s68 of the Criminal Procedure Act waives the right to a committal proceeding, and the Crown consents, as a result of which a magistrate commits that person for trial without there having been a committal proceeding, so as to obviate the admission of the statements of prosecution witnesses, and where the maker of the statement becomes relevantly unavailable to give evidence, then s289(2) does not permit those statements to be read on a trial. This gives rise to a considerable gap in the capacity of the prosecution to adduce relevant evidence on a trial. 
     
      
    100 Ms Winston pointed out that the District Court file contains the police brief of evidence, which, in turn, appears to contain the statement attributed to “James Gould” who is identified as the Bar Manager of the Fishermen’s Club, and which is obviously a mistaken reference to Mr Mathew James Gould. That does not alter my view that s289(2) would not have made his statement admissible on the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
    101 Even if this were incorrect, I would not decide the appellant’s ground of appeal on the basis that Mr Gould’s statement could have been made admissible by an alternative route, never raised at the trial. When counsel for the appellant said that the statement was to be tendered under s65, the Crown Prosecutor made no dissent. That may even have been because he recognised that, there having been no committal proceeding, and the statement not having been admitted at committal proceedings, s289 had no application. It may have been for other reasons. 
     
      
    102 In its opening words, s289(2) reserves to the trial court a discretion, in the widest terms, to refuse to admit a statement tendered under the subsection. Subs(6) reserves the right to reject any part of a statement as inadmissible. Had s289 been raised at the trial, the trial judge would have been required to consider and exercise those discretions. It is inappropriate for this Court to take on that role. 
     
      
    103 I reject the Crown’s argument that Ground 1 should fail because Mr Gould’s statement may have otherwise been admissible. 
     
      
       
      the proviso to s6 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       
      
    104 Since I have concluded that inadmissible evidence was placed before the jury, and notwithstanding my expressed view that that does not establish any ground of appeal for which s6 provides, I should conclude by referring to the proviso to s6. 
     
      
    105 I have already mentioned the grounds of appeal for which s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides. It is now necessary to consider the well-known proviso to that subsection. It provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “... provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    106 The Crown contended that, even if this Court were to find that either of the grounds of appeal was made good, nevertheless, it should apply to the proviso to dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    107 The task of this Court in considering the application of the proviso has most recently been the subject of explanation by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 80 ALJR 444. It is a task to be undertaken in the same way as the task of determining a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The court is required to: 
     
      
       
        
        “... make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” (internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    108 Their Honours then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[43] There are, however, some matters to which particular attention should be drawn. First, the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the  
        whole 
         of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court is not ‘to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out’. But there are cases in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial. Secondly, it is necessary always to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials such as the present and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.” (internal reference omitted; italics in original) 
        
       
       
      Finally, the Court laid down three “fundamental propositions”. They are: 
       
       
        
        (i) “...the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) “... the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks”; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) “... the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
       
      And the Court offered one negative proposition, in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “[44] ... It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    109 I have already made some reference to evidence, besides that the subject of the grounds of appeal, in the trial. There was an abundance of evidence about the appellant’s conduct, both before and after the occurrences in the toilets. 
     
      
    110 The complainant, Mr Nichols, described observing a person who was pointed out to him as a director of the club (obviously the appellant) who was, on Mr Nichols’ arrival, “fairly drunk”. Ms Deidra Murphy gave evidence that she arrived at the club at about 9.00 or 9.30 pm and joined Mr Nichols and Sean (also known as John) Brosnan. She said that the appellant approached their table “and was pretty loud and obnoxious”, attempting to engage her group in conversation, an attempt which was rebuffed by them. She then saw the appellant drop his pants. He continued to be “loud, obnoxious, swearing”. She reported his conduct to the Manager. Shortly after she decided to leave. She saw the appellant walk from the direction of the men’s toilets towards the table that she and her group had occupied, towards Mr Brosnan, where: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was basically, wanted to have a go at Sean, accusing Sean of reporting him, ...” 
        
       
       
      In cross-examination of Ms Murphy it was elicited that, in a statement to police, she had said that the appellant was dancing in his bare feet. 
       
      
    111 Ms Murphy was challenged as to the evidence she gave about the appellant’s conduct in “dropping his trousers” but her evidence to this effect was confirmed by Mr Brosnan.  
     
      
    112 Evidence given by Mr Graham Watson, who was called in the prosecution case, was also of some significance. Mr Watson had not been present in the club on the evening in question, but was there very early the following morning to repair one of the club’s boats. At about 6.30 am he saw the appellant and had a conversation with him. He then recounted the conversation, referred to above, in which the appellant described to him his part in the events. That included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “... he turned around and told me that he was in the toilet and a bloke walked up behind him and he turned around and kicked him in the head and then urinated on him.” 
        
       
      
    113 In answer to another question, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Brett Vickers urinated on whoever it was, was in the toilet, I didn’t know who it was at the time.” 
        
       
       
      In cross-examination he gave this evidence: 
       
       
        
        “... I said that Brett Vickers told me that someone walked up behind him and went to hit him, he spun around and hit him in the head and then urinated on him. That is what is in my statement and that is what I am saying now.” 
        
       
      
    114 It was put to him that the appellant had not said any such thing, but he adhered to his evidence. 
     
      
    115 Applying the test laid down in Weiss, I am satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I am satisfied that the admission of the inadmissible evidence would and should have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned. The evidence properly admitted at trial proves beyond reasonable doubt the appellant’s guilt of the offence with which he was charged. 
     
      
    116 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    117 HALL, J: I have read in draft form the judgment of Simpson, J. and I agree with her Honour’s conclusion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed and also with the reasons expressed in support of that conclusion. 
     
      
    118 There is one matter about which I record an additional comment. That matter is whether or not it can be said that a decision was made over an objection on behalf of the appellant on the basis of the admissibility of relevant statements of Mr. Gould for the purposes of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
    119 I am of the opinion that leave should be granted pursuant to Rule 4, if such leave is required, without deciding whether such leave is necessary in this case.  
     
      
    120 Whilst I consider, with respect, that the reasons stated by Simpson, J. in support of her Honour’s conclusion, that leave under Rule 4 is required, to be persuasive, for the reason expressed in the judgment of James, J., at [17], I defer from expressing a concluded opinion on that matter and upon the issues that are subjacent to it. 
     
      
    121 That said, I am, as I have stated, in agreement with the orders proposed by Simpson, J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 7 March 2005 following his pleas of guilty to one count of robbery in company and one of robbery being armed with an offensive weapon. Each offence is an offence against s97 of the Crimes Act 1900, and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. On the first count (robbery in company) Marien DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years, commencing on 17 February 2004 and expiring on 16 February 2008; on the second count (armed robbery) he sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of five years, commencing on 17 February 2007 (and thus accumulated on the earlier-imposed sentence by three years) with a non-parole period of three years, which will expire on 16 February 2010. The total sentence thereby imposed was of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
       
      facts 
       
      
    2 The first offence (robbery in company) was committed on 18 February 2003. At about 8.00 pm on that day, the applicant, in company with another person whose identity has not been established, walked into a liquor store at Leumeah and approached the attendant. The co-offender produced a handgun which he pushed into the attendant’s ribs; he demanded that the attendant get on the ground. 
     
      
    3 The applicant told the attendant to get up and open the cash register, an order with which he complied. The applicant removed a sum of money. Another customer arrived at the store and was ordered by the co-offender to get inside. The co-offender then asked where the safe was. The attendant told him where it was but said that it could not be opened. The applicant took some spirits from underneath the front counter. The co-offender told the attendant not to tell anybody what had happened, with the threat that he knew where the attendant lived. 
     
      
    4 The second offence was committed by the applicant alone on 23 October 2003. It also took place in a liquor store, this time in Marrickville. At about 5.00 pm the applicant entered the store and walked around for a short time before approaching the counter. He produced a semi-automatic firearm and pointed it towards the attendant’s chest. He demanded to be given money. The attendant opened the till and handed all of the notes to the applicant. The applicant took EFTPOS receipts from the till. He told the attendant to open the safe, and told him, “no funny stuff”. The attendant opened the safe and handed the applicant several coin rolls. The applicant demanded the attendant’s wallet, from which the attendant produced $700 in notes. He also asked for the attendant’s driver’s licence. The money taken from the till amounted to a little over $3,000. 
     
      
       
      subjective circumstances 
       
      
    5 The applicant was born in New Zealand, of Tongan parents, on 28 July 1980. He was, accordingly, 22 years of age at the time of the first offence; 23 at the second. (In these proceedings an issue has arisen about the correct age and date of birth of the applicant; the sentencing judge was, in fact, told that he had been born in 1979 and was 23 and 24 at the dates of the offences.) 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge was provided with a series of pre-sentence reports provided by the Probation and Parole Service, as well as a psychological report. The applicant gave evidence as did his de facto wife. 
     
      
    7 It is apparent that the applicant was less than frank with both the Probation and Parole Service Officer who provided the report, and with the psychologist. He told both that he was married, and told the probation officer that he and his wife had two children. The reality is that the applicant was living in a de facto relationship. His partner, who is considerably older than he, has the care of two grandchildren. The applicant, however, plays a significant role in the lives of the children and performs a parental role. 
     
      
    8 He told the probation officer that he began using cannabis and alcohol at the age of eight or nine; he told the psychologist that he began to consume alcohol at the age of 18. He told the psychologist that he was the oldest of 11 children in his family; in oral evidence he said that he was the third eldest of 11 children. He told the psychologist that he did not gain anything from the robbery. This appears inconsistent with the statement of facts. The discrepancies do not appear to have been regarded as particularly significant by the sentencing judge, but they do invite some scepticism about the accuracy of the history the applicant gave to the probation officer and the psychologist. Bearing that in mind, his Honour appears to have accepted the majority of what was reported about the applicant, and to have accepted the oral evidence that he gave. 
     
      
    9 The family came to Australia when the applicant was about two years of age. The applicant’s father is a Methodist minister. He was said to be a very strict disciplinarian. 
     
      
    10 The psychologist appears to have formed a reasonably favourable view of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. He concluded that there was no significant emotional disturbance, but that he did suffer from feelings of discouragement, low self-esteem, a degree of behavioural apathy, and feelings of inadequacy. He is immature, and has inadequately developed personality resources, or resources for independent functioning. He is not prone to aggressive behaviour although this may not be so when he is intoxicated. He has strong dependency needs. He was assessed as having a lower than average likelihood of recidivism, but the risk would be increased by substance abuse, inadequate impulse control, and peer group influences. He is of average intellectual ability. 
     
      
    11 In his evidence the applicant expressed regret for his conduct, and the effect that he recognised it must have had upon the liquor store attendants. The applicant has in the past had work, having been an apprentice carpenter, and having almost completed a TAFE course in carpentry.  
     
      
    12 He has a criminal record, which the sentencing judge regarded as not very serious. However, it includes a stealing offence for which he was dealt with in January 1995, in the Children’s Court and a number of other Children’s Court matters, of which the most serious and most relevant are an offence of robbery with aggression and attempted armed robbery in company, associated with other offences of lesser apparent seriousness. The applicant was dealt with for these offences in September 1995 in the Children’s Court, and was subjected to a control order for four months with an additional term of eight months. These sentences are the subject of one of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    13 On 3 February 2004 he was dealt with at the Liverpool Local Court on a charge of break and enter with intent to steal, and possession of housebreaking implements. On each of these he was sentenced to imprisonment for three months, commencing on 18 November 2003 and expiring on 17 February 2004. That is the reason for the selection of the commencement date of the present sentences. 
     
      
       
      the remarks on sentence 
       
      
    14 Marien DCJ recounted the facts of the offences, and the various aspects of the applicant’s personal circumstances that had been put before him. As to his criminal record he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As an adult his record cannot be described as serious, comprising such offences as break enter and steal, possess housebreaking implements, and also convictions for larceny.” 
        
       
       
      He then said: 
       
       
        
        “It is of some concern that there appear to be a number of matters in the Children’s Court, but in particular I note that the offender was dealt with in September 1995 for the offence of robbery with aggression and also the offence of attempt armed robbery in company. For both of those matters he received a control order of four months with an additional term of eight months.” 
        
       
       
      Later, again with reference to these offences, and in the context of directing himself in terms of  
      R v Henry  
      [1999] NSWCCA 111;46 NSWLR 346 his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “Clearly, it cannot be said that the offender has no or little criminal history, given the robbery matters for which he was dealt with in the Children’s Court. 
        
       
       
        
        However, Mr Doyle submitted to me that I would take into account that they were in fact offences committed when he was a child, and some ten years ago. I do take that into account.” 
        
       
       
      He recorded the position as to the pleas of guilty. 
       
      
    15 The plea in respect to the armed robbery offence was entered in the Local Court and the applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence. The Crown conceded that that plea was entered at the first opportunity. The plea in respect of the robbery in company offence, however, was entered on 24 May 2004, which was the day fixed for the commencement of the trial. Marien DCJ did not quantify any discount he allowed the applicant in respect of the pleas of guilty. This was, I infer, because he sentenced by reference to the decision of this Court in Henry. The guideline sentence there promulgated has incorporated in it recognition of a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16 His Honour considered that the robbery in company offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was in possession of an offensive weapon. This is not strictly correct; it was the co-offender who was in possession of the weapon. This was known to his Honour, because he had expressly alluded to it during the course of the applicant’s cross-examination. His Honour held that the armed robbery offence was aggravated by the fact that he had previously committed the robbery in company. 
     
      
    17 A submission was made that his Honour ought to find that special circumstances pursuant to s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) existed, justifying departure from the ratio there specified between a head sentence and a non-parole period. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree that those special circumstances justifying that variation are demonstrated in this case and I therefore do propose to vary the statutory ratio.” 
        
       
      
    18 When it came to sentencing on the armed robbery offence, his Honour did implement that intention; he reduced by nine months the non-parole period that would otherwise have been applicable to a sentence of five years. However, by reason of the accumulation of the second sentence on the first, and whether intentionally or otherwise, his Honour restored the statutory ratio. The overall sentence is precisely in the statutory ratio. 
     
      
       
      the grounds of the application 
       
      
    19 Four grounds of the application were pleaded. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account previous matters dealt with in the Children’s Court. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred in his finding that the offence of 18 February 2003 was aggravated by the possession of an offensive weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to reduce the effective non-parole period below 75% of the effective overall term. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The head sentence and non-parole period are manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      ground 1 
       
      
    20 This Court received additional evidence, being a New Zealand issued birth certificate in the name of Amone Brian Barrett Moeakiola Tapueluelu. This shows a birth date of 28 July 1980. As I have indicated, the sentencing judge was told, including by the applicant himself, that his birth date was 28 July 1979. 
     
      
    21 I would accept the evidence of the Birth Certificate, and proceed on the basis that 1980 is the correct year of the applicant’s birth. That is said to have this significance. On 15 September 1995 the applicant was convicted in the Bidura Children’s Court of a series of offences, which include robbery in company, attempted armed robbery in company and violent disorder. These are the offences mentioned earlier, and were referred to by the sentencing judge. The papers of the Children’s Court show a birth date of 28 August 1979. At that time the applicant was 15 years of age. The papers do not show the date of the offences. 
     
      
    22 S14 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (“the C(CP) Act”) relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “14 Recording of conviction 
         
         
        (1) Without limiting any other power of a court to deal with a child who has pleaded guilty to, or has been found guilty of, an offence, a court:  
         
          
          (a) shall not, in respect of any offence, proceed to, or record such a finding as, a conviction in relation to a child who is under the age of 16 years, ...” 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 This establishes that the recording of the conviction in the Children’s Court was an error, although an error brought about by the erroneous information provided to that Court. Had the correct information as to the applicant’s date of birth been available to that Court, then the Court would not have recorded a conviction. This is not the occasion to correct error on the part of the Children’s Court; but it does have an impact on the approach taken by Marien DCJ. 
     
      
    24 S15 of the C(CP) Act relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “15 Evidence of prior offences and other matters not admissible in certain criminal proceedings  
         
         
        (1) The fact that a person has pleaded guilty to an offence in, or has been found guilty of an offence by, a court (being an offence committed when the person was a child) shall not be admitted in evidence (whether as to guilt or the imposition of any penalty) in any criminal proceedings subsequently taken against the person in respect of any other offence if:  
         
          
           
          (a) a conviction was not recorded against the person in respect of the firstmentioned offence,  
          and 
            
           
           
          (b) the person has not, within the period of 2 years prior to the commencement of proceedings for the other offence, been subject to any judgment, sentence or order of a court whereby the person has been punished for any other offence.” (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 “Child” is defined in s3 of the C(CP) Act as a person under the age of 18 years. 
     
      
    26 The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the Children’s Court offences were committed while he was a child; (the Children’s Court records, which were admitted in evidence for the applicant, show that these offences, which include offences that do not appear on the record provided to this Court, were committed on 31 August 1995, when, on the information now available, and which I would accept, the applicant was 15 years of age); a conviction ought not to have been recorded by reason of his age; and, if accurately informed, Marien DCJ ought not and would not have admitted evidence of those criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    27 The first of these arguments may be accepted: on facts truly recorded, a conviction ought not to have been recorded against the applicant in 1995. 
     
      
    28 There is, however, a flaw in the second part of the argument. S15 is not dependent upon there having been a “conviction”. It is concerned with evidence of prior offences committed by children. But the section provides two conditions precedent to the prohibition on the admission in evidence of the earlier offence(s). The first of these is that a conviction was not recorded. I accept that this Court ought to proceed upon the basis that a conviction ought not to have been recorded was not recorded. The first condition is notionally met. The second condition is that the person has not within two years prior to the commencement of the proceedings for the other offence been subject to any judgment, sentence or order of a court whereby the person has been punished for any other offence. The “other offence” or “other offences” were the two offences with which Marien DCJ was dealing. The proceedings in relation to those offences were commenced, respectively, on 8 December 2003 and 18 May 2004. The applicant’s record shows that, on 8 May 2003 and 4 August 2003 the applicant was fined in respect of driving offences, one of which was driving whilst his licence was cancelled. That is, within the two years preceding both of the “other offences” (the present offences) he was subject to the judgment, sentence, or order of a court whereby he was punished for another offence. On 3 February 2004 he was sentenced to the three months’ control order, which I have already mentioned. This is relevant to the armed robbery offence, being within the period of two years prior to the commencement of proceedings in respect of that offence; it is not relevant in relation to the offence of robbery in company, since it post-dates that offence. 
     
      
    29 There were also offences for which the applicant was fined, on 7 November 2003. 
     
      
    30 Counsel for the applicant argued that the second condition as contained in s15(1)(b) does not render admissible evidence of the 1995 offences because they are outside the two year date: that is, that the subsections ought to be construed as excluding evidence of prior offences when they were committed within two years of the commencement of the current proceedings. In my opinion it is inescapable that s15 is intended to protect a person who has remained crime free for a period of two years from suffering the admission of evidence of offences committed outside of that period, but once it is established that the crime-free period has not existed, then evidence of any other offences, whenever committed, does become admissible, or at least they are not subject to the prohibition otherwise contained in s15. That is the only logical way of reading s15. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion the response made on behalf of the Crown to the applicant’s contention is well made and correct. Evidence of the applicant’s prior criminal conduct was not prohibited by s15(1). 
     
      
    32 It is immaterial that the proceedings in the Children’s Court were said to result in a conviction; that did not have any bearing upon the course taken by the sentencing judge. Indeed, his Honour at no time used the word “conviction”. 
     
      
    33 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      ground 2 
       
      
    34 By the second ground the applicant complains that his Honour misdirected himself by saying that the offence of robbery in company was aggravated by the fact that he was in possession of an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    35 I do not think this ground can be made good. The applicant’s co-offender was in possession of what might have been more than an offensive weapon, that is, a dangerous weapon; for the purpose of joint criminal liability, the applicant is taken also to have been in possession of it. His Honour was well aware that it was in fact the co-offender who had actual possession of the weapon. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      ground 3 
       
      
    36 The complaint here made is that, while expressly stating his intention of varying the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period, his Honour failed to do so in relation to the time the applicant is actually to spend in custody. 
     
      
    37 On behalf of the Crown, the approach taken by the sentencing judge was defended. The Crown submitted that his Honour did not intend to vary the overall sentence. I do not think this can be accepted. His Honour made the observation in the context of recording a submission about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation: 
     
      
       
        
        “... and the clear need for ongoing and extended supervision in relation to [his alcohol] problem”. 
        
       
      
    38 I think his Honour clearly did intend to vary the ratio between the effective non-parole period and head sentence. That was not reflected in the sentences ultimately passed. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion this ground has been made good. 
     
      
       
      ground 4 
       
      
    40 On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the previously asserted errors had led to the imposition of a manifestly excessive sentence. I have rejected two of those grounds. 
     
      
    41 In my opinion, it has not been shown that either sentence was manifestly excessive, although I would accept that they are at the upper end of the range available. The question is really whether the accumulation gave rise to a manifestly excessive total term of imprisonment. This was a head sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of six years. I am not prepared to find that this was manifestly excessive. In my opinion, while heavy, it was within the available sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion the only error shown is in the non-implementation, in the practical result, of a finding of special circumstances. That calls for this Court to consider the re-sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
    43 The Court received an affidavit affirmed by the applicant which confirms that he is making some effort at, and progress towards, rehabilitation. He has adopted a commitment to religion. His mother died on 1 January this year. The affidavit, while encouraging, does not really add anything to the material that was before Marien DCJ. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the applicant is entitled to expect, as it was suggested to him, that he would be granted the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, and, in my opinion, This Court should interfere to implement that intention. 
     
      
    44 I propose that the non-parole period imposed in respect of the armed robbery charge be reduced by nine months. The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) the sentence imposed in respect of the offence of robbery being armed with an offensive weapon be quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for five years to commence on 17 February 2007 and to expire on 16 February 2012, with a non-parole period of two years and three months, to commence on 17 February 2007 and expire on 16 May 2009. The first date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole is 16 May 2009. 
       
      
    45 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    46 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    47 GROVE J: The order of the Court will therefore be as proposed by Simpson J.

    3 HOWIE J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed by Judge Ellis (the Judge) following upon the respondent pleading guilty to an indictment containing nine child sexual assault offences all committed against a single complainant, a female child aged 13 years. The Crown asserts that the sentences imposed were overall manifestly inadequate as failing to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences committed by the respondent. The respondent was sentenced on 9 September 2005 and the notice of appeal by the Crown was dated 3 November 2005. 
     
      
    4 The offences for which the respondent was to be sentenced can be considered in two groups. The first related to offences committed on 27 January 2004 and included the first three counts on the indictment. The first and third counts were offences of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act for which a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment is prescribed and to which a standard non-parole period of five years applied. The third count alleged an offence of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 10 and 14 years contrary to s 66C(1) of that Act for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 16 years is prescribed. The second group of offences occurred on 19 April 2004 and included six counts on the indictment. The fourth count on the indictment alleged an offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) and the fifth to ninth counts alleged offences of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 10 and 14 years contrary to s 66C(1). 
     
      
    5 On 19 September 2005 the Judge sentenced the applicant to a total overall term of imprisonment for 21 months with a minimum period to be served of nine months. That minimum period is to expire on 29 May 2006, the date upon which the respondent is to be released to parole. The sentence was made up as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Counts 1, 3: imprisonment for a fixed term of three months to date from 31 August 2005 and expiring on 30 November 2005; 
         
         
        Count 2: a non-parole period of six months imprisonment to date from 31 August 2005 and expiring on 27th February 2006 with a balance of term of imprisonment of 12 months to date from 28 February 2006; 
         
         
        Count 4: imprisonment for a fixed term of three months to date from 30 November 2005 and expiring on 28 February 2006; 
         
         
        Counts 5 - 9: a non-parole period of six months imprisonment to date from 30 November 2005 and expiring on 29 May 2006 with a balance of term of imprisonment for 12 months to date from 30 May 2006. 
        
       
       
      The facts 
      
    6 There was an agreed statement of facts placed before the court and can be summarised as follows. In December 2003 the complainant, who was aged 13, entered a chat room on an Internet site where she came into contact with the respondent who described himself as a male over 21. The respondent was in fact then aged 47. The complainant started communicating with the respondent by e-mail and in the chat room. Eventually the respondent and the complainant exchanged mobile telephone numbers. The respondent rang the complainant on a number of occasions and once suggested that they meet but she declined to do so. The complainant and the respondent discussed sexually explicit matters both on the phone and via the Internet once or twice a week. 
     
      
    7 On 27 January 2004 the complainant rang the offender and they agreed to meet at a park not far from her home in Putney. On arriving at the park the complainant entered the respondent’s motor vehicle. She then saw that he was much older than she had assumed but nonetheless they began hugging and kissing. While this was occurring, the respondent used his hands to touch both her breasts. He leant over and pulled up her clothing and sucked her left nipple. This act gave rise to the first count on the indictment, an aggravated indecent assault. He commenced touching her pubic area and she eventually pulled down her underpants and, with her consent, the respondent placed a finger into her vagina. This act gave rise to the second count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. After a short while she asked him to stop what he was doing and he complied with her request. 
     
      
    8 The respondent then moved his vehicle to another location in the park in order to obtain more privacy. They again started kissing and he touched her breasts. This act gave rise to the third count on the indictment, an aggravated indecent assault. Eventually the complainant indicated that she had to leave and the respondent dropped her off at a nearby street. They remained in contact via the Internet and over the telephone. 
     
      
    9 On 19 April 2004 the complainant telephoned the respondent and asked if they could meet. Later that day he drove to Putney and met the complainant. She entered the motor vehicle and they began to hug and kiss. She suggested that they go to his home and he agreed. After arriving there, they sat together on a couch in the lounge room and started cuddling. The respondent touched the complainant's vagina through her underpants and this act gave rise to the fourth count on the indictment, an aggravated indecent assault. 
     
      
    10 The complainant removed her underpants and the respondent digitally penetrated her vagina. He asked her whether she wanted him ""to go down"" on her and she agreed. The respondent then performed oral sex on her vagina. This act gave rise to the fifth count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. After a short time the complainant asked him to stop oral sex but to touch her on the vagina. He complied with the request. She then suggested that they have what she called ""dry sex"" involving the respondent lying on her and pressing his penis against her vagina but while still clothed. He agreed to this suggestion. The complainant then suggested that they have ""dry anal sex"" and this occurred. She next asked the respondent to ""rim"" her and he kissed and licked her bottom and anus. The respondent then placed his finger into her anus and this act gave rise to the sixth count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. The complainant asked him to stop and he did so. She then suggested that they go to his bedroom, which they did. 
     
      
    11 The complainant got on to the bed and began taking off her clothing. As she removed her skirt, the respondent again performed oral sex on her vagina, an act that gave rise to the seventh count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. He apologised for this act and they both again simulated sex on the bed. The respondent took off his pants and asked her if she wanted to have sexual intercourse. She declined but suggested they try anal intercourse and he agreed. He then obtained some lubricant and placed it on her anus before placing his penis into her. This act gave rise to the eighth count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. This act caused the complainant pain and she screamed. He removed his penis and apologised for the pain. He then put on his underwear. A short time later the respondent exposed his penis and the complainant fellated him until he ejaculated into her mouth. This act gave rise to the ninth count on the indictment, sexual intercourse. Shortly thereafter the complainant told the respondent she wished to go and he drove her home. 
     
      
    12 There was a victim impact statement by the complainant placed before the sentencing judge in which the complainant indicated that she had suffered physical harm (a tear to her anus), mental harm (in which she said that she ""felt shaken"" whenever she heard the word ""rape"" or the name ""Colin”), emotional and psychological harm. She indicated that there had been attempts at self-harm since the commission of the offence. 
     
      
       
        
        Respondent’s subjective case 
        
       
      
    13 The respondent was aged 48 years at the time of sentence and was residing with his de-facto, he having separated from his wife who continued to live in the family home with their two children aged 13 and 10. The respondent had no prior criminal record but had been charged and dealt with for a number of driving matters since the commission of the offences and while he was on bail awaiting the determination of these charges. He had been unemployed since February 2004 because he was suffering from depression. 
     
      
    14 There was in evidence a presentence report that set out the respondent's background. Little of it was relevant apart from the fact that apparently at the age of 33 the respondent found out that he had been adopted and was so affected by this discovery that he was traumatised and needed counselling. There was a suggestion that at some period after this event the respondent had started to act in an inappropriate manner including fraternising with young girls, often whom he met through Internet chat rooms. Apparently it was this behaviour that led to the deterioration in the relationship between the respondent and his wife. 
     
      
    15 In relation to his attitude to the offences the report stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When questioned about his feelings in relation to the offences, [the respondent] claimed that he had allowed himself to fall into a fragile and vulnerable state due to the break up of his marriage. He stated that the offence sickens him and that he cannot believe he behaved like that. He expressed remorse and several times stated that he hoped the victim was not suffering in any way. 
        
       
      
    16 There was also in evidence a psychological report. The respondent told the psychologist that he had suffered from depression since 1987. He was treated for a period of about five years by a psychiatrist for this disorder. He said that he discontinued treatment but in 1997 had a severe episode of depression that lasted about eight weeks. He was treated by a different psychiatrist for about four years and was placed on medication to relieve his symptoms. In the beginning of 2005 he entered a private psychiatric hospital because of his depression and abuse of alcohol. He was a resident there for four weeks. He then had follow up consultations for 10 weeks. At the date of the report, September 2005, the respondent had finished that course of treatment and was looking for a new therapist. 
     
      
    17 The respondent gave the following account to the psychologist of the offences for which he was sentenced: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He stated that in December 2003 the victim,[ ], entered his chat room. He said that initially he thought that she was a late teenager and was interested in music and literature. He said that she was also interested in ""Gothic subculture"". He said that when he met her he was surprised to find out that she was so young. 
         
         
        He stated that he began to suspect in early 2004 that she was not a late teenager because she began to talk more about school and that previously he thought that she was referring to TAFE. He said also her comments about the nature of her musical interest made him suspicious. He said that she claims that she had told him of her age early on in their chat room conversations and he now accepts this. 
         
         
        He said that he had agreed to meet her as she seemed to be very upset. He said that when they met she initiated the sexual activity. In relation to this he said ""I don't know what was going on in my head at the time"". He then said that when he first met her she looked older and that her voice was quite mature. He said that she seemed very assured of herself. 
         
         
        He said that he agreed to meet with her the second time because she wanted to talk about family matters and was also embarrassed at how they had behaved previously. He said that he picked her up and that she had then put pressure on him for sexual activity. In relation to this he said ""I was just stupid - I just don't believe that I let something like that happen"". 
         
         
        He said that he was very depressed at the time but doesn't know how this may have contributed to his behaviour. However he said ""but when I'm depressed I can only see a narrow range of emotions"". He feels that his depression may have made him more vulnerable as he said that he had his ""ego stroked by her"". 
         
         
        He said that after the second meeting ""I realised her view of me was largely out of proportion. I had already made a decision that the relationship would have to be put aside"". He said that now ""it makes me feel a bit sick and if I could go back and change it I would. I'm so upset with myself that I let myself do anything at all. I have always valued my work with my kids. I was a youth worker at my church for a number of years"". He also stated that he had been involved in sporting activities with his children and had not felt vulnerable. However he said that he had been very isolated at that time of his life. He said that he had been able to go to work until the last week of February but that even at work he had isolated himself. He said that by the time of the second meeting he was unemployed and did not leave home very often. 
        
       
      
    18 In that part of his report under the heading ""Opinions"" the psychologist stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On the basis of information available at the time of preparing this report I am of the opinion that [the respondent’s] offending behaviour occurred because of his depressive illness and his faulty decision making and impaired judgment which accompanied his disorder. 
         
         
        He is presently assessed as having a low likelihood of recidivism in general, and a low likelihood of sexual recidivism. These opinions are based on actuarial analyses and other methods used during the assessment. The only significant risk factor which was revealed is that of major mental illness. However if [the respondent] is able to remain in appropriate psychiatric treatment he is not likely to engage in further offending behaviour. 
         
         
        Because of [the respondent’s] emotional disturbance any prison sentence imposed by the court will be very difficult for him to serve. It is very likely that his depression would deepen and could become even more intractable. If the court were to consider a sentence other than a custodial sentence then it would be recommended that he receives a long period of supervision with a condition being that he continues under psychiatric treatment. It would appear to be essential for his rehabilitation that he receives ongoing treatment for as long as is considered to be necessary. 
        
       
      
    19 There was a letter from a counsellor who had been involved with the respondent on a therapeutic basis since February 2004 in relation to depression management. There was also in evidence a letter from his estranged wife as to his relationship with his children and from the respondent's de-facto. 
     
      
       
        
        Sentencing remarks 
        
       
      
    20 In his sentencing remarks the Judge described offences contrary to s 61M and s 66C as ""very serious criminal offences"" and referred to the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole period. However he held: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In relation to the standard non-parole period, the Court notes that pleas of guilty were entered in this matter. The Court has reached the conclusion that the criminality involved is in the low to mid range for offences of this type. The Court notes that the standard non-parole period only applies after trial but that it nevertheless provides another goal (sic) post for the guidance of Courts when a trial is avoided by a plea of guilty. 
        
       
      
    21 After referring to R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 160 amongst other cases, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Court assesses the goal (sic) posts in light of the assessed criminality of each offence, the favourable subjective features of the offender and any discount entitlements and such things as plea of guilty. The non-parole period I propose to fix will reflect my assessment that the criminality is not within the moderate average or middle range but rather in the low to mid range and my assessment of the many favourable subjective factors. 
        
       
      
    22 In relation to the facts of the offences, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In this case there was a significant age difference he being aged 47 years and she 13 years. She in fact did consent to the activity. There were two separate occasions. The degree of exploitation of the youth of the victim is significant and the relationship commenced by reason of the offender's participation in a chat room on the net. 
        
       
      
    23 The judge determined that the discount on the order of 20 per cent was appropriate having regard to the plea of guilty and the expressed contrition. The Judge acknowledged that the plea of guilty saved the complainant from giving evidence and it was for that reason that the discount of that proportion had been allowed notwithstanding the late plea. 
     
      
    24 The Judge noted that the respondent had a depressive illness and that it appeared to be a significant illness but that he was no longer subject to the conflicts that were taking place within his home before he separated from his wife. He referred to the fact that the respondent was in a stable relationship, had attended counselling both as an inpatient and an outpatient and that he recognised the need to continue both therapy and medication. The Judge noted that the respondent was now not alone but had a support network of friends, his partner and the church. 
     
      
    25 The Judge observed that prior to the offences the respondent was a person of good character and he accepted that these incidents took place at a time ""when he was at a low ebb"". He held that there were no aggravating factors under s 21A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 and, in particular, that although the complainant suffered some harm, it was ""inappropriate to aggravate the harm in this case as is required by s21A by concluding that there was substantial harm"". The judge was not prepared to conclude that there was a mitigating factor that the offences were not planned. However he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Nevertheless on the second occasion there having been sexual activity on the first, it is difficult to see that the offender would have been oblivious to that as a reasonable possibility. He certainly showed no restraint on the second occasion and indicated no disinclination to participate. 
        
       
      
    26 The Judge concluded that it was necessary to partly cumulate the sentences to reflect the fact that there were two separate and discrete series of incidents. He found special circumstances “by reason of his mental health issues, and his need for ongoing psychological treatment, the fact that this will be his first time in custody and that it is likely that the sentence will be served in protection”. 
     
      
       
        
        Crown submissions 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown submitted that a number of features of the Judge’s process of reasoning stood out in the sentencing remarks. It was argued that the Judge gave prominence to the complainant's active consent to the offences and that ""this is the core to understanding the low level of sentences imposed"". The Crown criticised the Judge for taking a ""global approach to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the various offences without differentiating where the particular offence lay on the scale of seriousness"". It was suggested that his Honour was inconsistent in finding that there was at least an increase in the moral culpability of the respondent in relation to the second series of offences and yet he imposed the same penalty as for the first series of offences. The Crown submitted that the Judge was also inconsistent in his finding that the degree of exploitation of the complainant's youth was ""significant"" and yet the level of sentences did not accord with this finding. The Crown referred to a ""notable absence"" of any reference to general deterrence. 
     
      
    28 Although the Crown relied upon one ground of appeal, being that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, it identified a number of ways in which it asserted that such a result might have come about. Firstly, it submitted that the Judge failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offences, in particular, by taking into account the complainant's ""active encouragement of the respondent"". The Crown referred to the decision of this Court in R v SG [2003] NSWCCA 220 where Wood CJ at CL at [21] accepted that the fact that the complainant consented might render the objective circumstances of the offence “somewhat less serious” depending on the age of the offender and the victim. The Crown argued that, given the disparity in the ages and level of maturity between the victim and the respondent in the present case, no mitigation arose from the complainant’s consent and encouragement of the respondent. 
     
      
    29 The Crown points to the disparity between the standard non-parole period for the s 61M(1) offences of 5 years and the sentence of 3 months imposed by his Honour and contends that the Judge paid lip service to the requirement that the standard non-parole period remain as a guide post to the ultimate sentence. This is particularly so, argues the Crown, when the Judge described the criminality of the respondent as falling between the “low to mid range” of offending. It was submitted that a sentence of a fixed term of 3 months for the indecent assault offences completely fails to reflect the objective circumstances of the offences or the relevance of the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    30 The Crown complains that the Judge considered the seriousness of the offences in a “global way” without paying attention to each individual offence and analysing its seriousness as is required by Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. In particular the Crown argues that the sentence for the second series of offences is identical to that for the first series of offences, yet the Judge acknowledged that the second series of offences carried a greater degree of moral and criminal culpability on the basis that the respondent must have at least seen the possibility of sexual activity occurring. 
     
      
    31 The Crown also submitted that the Judge must have given too much weight to the respondent’s prior good character particularly having regard to the fact that the offences were calculated. Similarly the Crown contends that the Judge paid too much regard to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation notwithstanding that the psychologist reported that the respondent had little insight into his offending. Further the Crown argued that the Judge erred in taking into account that the respondent would serve his sentence “in harsher circumstances” having regard to the fact that this is a common element in sentencing an offender for child sexual assault offences and is taken into account in the range of sentences imposed for such offences: R v Durocher-Yvon (2003) 58 NSWLR 581. 
     
      
       
        
        Respondent’s reply 
        
       
      
    32 The respondent reminded the Court of the rarity of Crown appeals and the limits placed upon the Court’s discretion to interfere particularly where the ground relied upon by the Crown is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate: see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 and R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. It was submitted that the sentences imposed were not outside the range available to the Judge in the exercise of his discretion. The Crown had conceded and the Judge accepted that the seriousness of the offences were in the “low to mid range”. 
     
      
    33 Much weight is placed by the respondent upon his mental condition as an answer to the Crown’s complaint that the Judge failed to have any regard to the importance of general deterrence when sentencing the respondent. In particular it was argued that as the psychologist had found that the offences were caused by the respondent’s depressive illness, then the principles in cases such as R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 and R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 apply. The mental condition of the respondent was said to impact upon his criminal culpability for the offences and permitted the Judge to give less weight to general deterrence. 
     
      
    34 In answer to the matters raised by the Crown it was submitted that the Judge was entitled to give weight to the very active role taken by the complainant particularly in light of the respondent’s mental condition. It was noted that the complainant had been the person who had initiated and directed the sexual activity. Emphasis was placed upon the fact that the respondent was not a paedophile and that treatment of his mental condition would ensure his rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
        
        Determination of appeal 
        
       
      
    35 In my opinion the Crown submissions should be accepted and the sentence is manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. In light of the difference in the ages between the respondent and the complainant there was little mitigation in the fact that the complainant was consenting and encouraging the respondent.  Had the complainant not been consenting, the criminality would have been aggravated for that reason. As the Judge noted, the culpability of the respondent for the second series of offences was increased above that for the first series. The offences committed on 19 April were more serious in themselves and the respondent must have known of at least the possibility of further sexual activity with the complainant. I would be prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent knew that sexual activity would be the result of the meeting with the complainant and he went to meet her for that purpose. The respondent had ample time to reflect on his conduct on 27 January and cease the relationship. The sentences for the second series of offences fail to reflect the Judge’s finding as to the increased culpability for those offences or the level of the respondent’s criminality. 
     
      
    36 The Judge was not prepared to mitigate the offences on the basis that they were not part of planned criminal activity. The Judge accepted that the meetings with the complainant were planned and that the relationship arose from the respondent’s activity on the Internet site. At that time the respondent knew the complainant’s age and he was disguising his. It is clear that by the time of the first meeting the respondent was involved in an inappropriate relationship with the child from which he must have been obtaining sexual gratification. The respondent discussed with the complainant “sexually explicit matters” on the telephone and via the Internet in what the complainant referred to as “phone sex or cyber sex”. There may be an argument as to whether the respondent was “grooming” the child, as that term is used in relation to paedophilia, but this was not a case where a vulnerable man found himself suddenly and by chance in the company of a promiscuous child. 
     
      
    37 The sentences imposed generally do not reflect the Judge’s expressed opinion that offences of this type are very serious or that the offending was in the low to mid range. If the sexual intercourse offences were below the middle range of offending, they were not very far below, given their nature, the age of the complainant and the disparity between her level of maturity and that of the respondent. The Judge found that the degree of exploitation of the youth of the victim was “significant”, which in my view is an underestimation at least so far as the second group of offences are concerned. The fact that there was no long term history of offending is relevant but not decisive to a determination of where in the range of offending covered by s 61M(1) and s 66C(1) these particular offences came: R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [20]. 
     
      
    38 One of the difficulties in sentencing the respondent having regard to the standard non-parole period specified for the s 61M(1) offences is the somewhat curious and inconsistent approach of the legislature in that regard. As has been pointed out the standard non-parole period for an aggravated indecent assault is imprisonment for 5 years yet the maximum penalty prescribed is 7 years. However the maximum penalty for each of the sexual intercourse offences was 13 years with no standard non-parole period. Yet clearly the sexual intercourse offences were more serious than the indecent assault offences, the latter being somewhere towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness for those offences. 
     
      
    39 The Judge accepted that the respondent was suffering from depression at the time of offending. He made no finding as to the causal relationship between the illness and the offending. I would question the competence of the psychologist to give the opinions he did so far as they suggest that the respondent was suffering from a major psychiatric illness and do not accept his findings where they have not been accepted by the Judge. Their reliability so far as the respondent’s mental history was concerned was highly dubious given that they were based exclusively on what he was told by the respondent. The presentence report indicates that at best the respondent is an unreliable historian in relation to his treatment for his depression. But in my opinion, even if it is accepted that the applicant’s mental state had some role to play in the offending, I do not believe that it could be a factor justifying the extraordinary leniency of the sentences imposed, especially for the second group of offences given the circumstances in which they occurred.  
     
      
    40 Deterrence is one of the principal purposes of punishment. This was emphasised in R v Radich [1954] NZLR 86 where the Court said at 87: 
     
      
       
        
         
        one of the main purposes of punishment is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment. 
         
        
       
      
    41 This Court has consistently applied this principle, particularly in cases of child sexual assault: see generally R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 and cases discussed therein. The offences of which the respondent has been convicted and the method of procurement of the supposed consent of the complainant are both serious and insidious. Users of Internet chat rooms should be well aware that crimes committed in such circumstances are treated with great concern by the criminal justice system and will be dealt with severely. Children must be protected from themselves and from those who prey on their vulnerability by gaining access to them through means such as that used by the respondent. The only way that this policy can be achieved is by the courts imposing condign punishment upon those convicted of such offences in the hope that others who minded to act in the same way might fear the consequences if they are caught. 
     
      
    42 On a true analysis of the evidence of the psychologist the respondent’s mental condition does not in my opinion give rise to the principles expounded in those cases dealing with serious mental conditions that permit a court to give less weight to general deterrence. There is no reliable evidence that the respondent suffered from a severe psychiatric condition at any time let alone at the time of the offending. The fact that he was depressed and receiving medication and counselling does not itself suggest that he had an illness of the kind and severity that general deterrence should be disregarded let alone limited in its importance. Very many people in the community suffer depression, often as a reaction to domestic problems, for which they need counselling and medication without committing criminal offences. This is not to minimise the effect that such a condition can have on the ability of a person to function to their true worth and potential. But it is quite another thing to suggest that such an illness should explain, let alone mitigate to a very significant degree, criminal conduct of the nature of which the respondent indulged with this young child. The offending has to be viewed in the context of the whole of their relationship including the sexual content of their conversations before the meetings, a matter not mentioned by the psychologist. 
     
      
    43 Counsel for the respondent sought to rely upon the decision of the Court in R v Montesinos (2002) 135 A Crim R 417 as giving support to his submission as to the seriousness of the respondent’s mental condition and the effect it should have on the sentences to be imposed for these offences. However, in my opinion that case highlights the fact that the mental disorder of the respondent was not of the severity that significant regard should be had to it as reducing his culpability or the importance of general deterrence. The depression in that case was described as being “so profound that [the respondent] lurches along the edge of psychosis”. The illness in that case was described as “Major Depression”, which I understand to be a severe psychiatric condition. The respondent in that case was also described as being “in urgent need of effective psychiatric treatment and is a significant risk of suicide”. 
     
      
    44 If the Judge thought that the applicant’s mental condition was of such severity that he was prepared to limit the importance of general deterrence, he should expressly have made such a finding and indicated in a general way to what degree he was prepared to mitigate the punishment for that reason. General deterrence is such an important factor in sentencing for this type of offence because frequently the child will be consenting to the conduct and the aim of the offences is to protect children from themselves and those prepared to take advantage of their vulnerability. I am not prepared to accept that the Judge recognised the importance of general deterrence but dismissed or discounted it because of the respondent’s mental condition when he never expressly addressed that issue at all. 
     
      
    45 In any event whatever mitigating effect the respondent’s mental state might have had to the first series of offending, I do not give it the same weight in respect of the second series of offences. The Judge recognised that the respondent’s culpability was increased in respect of the offences occurring on the second occasion, yet this is not apparent in the sentences imposed. Further, although the Judge purported to apply the principle arising from the decision in Pearce, I fail to see how the sentence for any one of the sexual intercourse offences in the second series could reflect the criminality for all the offending on that occasion. As serious as the act of anal intercourse was, an appropriate penalty for that offence could not in my opinion reflect the totality of the criminality of the other acts of sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion the sentences were manifestly inadequate to the degree requiring the intervention of this Court notwithstanding the restraint to be exercised by this Court in relation to Crown appeals particularly where the Crown cannot point to any specific error in the exercise of discretion: see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 and R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. It is one of those relatively rare cases where simply to recite the facts and then the sentences imposed manifests the unreasonableness of the sentences notwithstanding a consideration of the respondent’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    47 The discretion of this Court to intervene notwithstanding a finding that the sentences were manifestly inadequate is raised by a consideration of the subjective matters of the respondent and the fact that he was looking forward to being released in May of this year. The Court has received an affidavit of the respondent as to matters that have occurred since sentence. Although the respondent has been on protection, there is nothing to indicate that his imprisonment is unduly harsh such that this Court should stay its hand. Rather it tends to undermine the Judge’s finding that it was relevant to a finding of special circumstances that the respondent would serve his period in custody in more difficult circumstances by reason of being on protection. In any event the onerous conditions of custody for child sexual offenders is reflected in the range of penalties imposed for those offences. 
     
      
    48 The sentences I propose are still lenient and significantly less than the respondent should have been given at first instance. This is not only in recognition of this being a Crown appeal but also because the respondent was expecting release to parole within a very short time of the hearing of the appeal. The sentences are bases upon a discount of 20 per cent and a finding of special circumstances for the reasons given by the Judge other than the fact that the respondent may serve his sentence on protection. In effect the overall sentence represents a minimum period in custody of 3 years and 6 months and a total term of 5 years less the discount for the plea. 
     
      
    49 The orders I propose are:Appeal allowed. Sentences imposed upon the respondent by Judge Ellis are quashed. In lieu the respondent is sentenced as follows:Counts 1 and 2A non-parole period of 9 months to date from 31 August 2005 and to expire on 30 May 2006 with a balance of term of 3 months to commence on 31 May 2006.Count 3A non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months to date from 31 August 2005 and to expire on 30 November 2006, with a balance of term of 9 months to commence from 1 December 2006.Count 4A non-parole period of 12 months to date from 31 May 2006 and to expire on 30 May 2007, with a balance of term of 9 months to commence on 31 May 2007.Counts 5,6,7,9A non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months to date from 1 March 2006 and to expire on 30 November 2007 and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months to commence on 1 December 2007. Count 8 A non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months to date from 31 August 2006 and to expire on 30 July 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 31 July 2008.24 August 200650. THE COURT: Since judgment in this matter was published it has been brought to the Court's attention that there is an inconsistency between the sentences imposed for counts 5 to 9 inclusive and the dates upon which the sentences are to commence or to expire. It was the intention of the Court that the sentences imposed were those as pronounced but the dates specified need to be corrected. The sentences for counts 5, 6, 7 and 9 should read:A non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months to date from 1 March 2006 and to expire on 31 October 2007 and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months to commence on 1 November 2007.The sentence for count 8 should read:A non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months to date from 31 August 2006 and to expire on 30 June 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 1 July 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: Mr Hassan Chahine appeals his conviction by a jury and seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by Shillington DCJ on 10 September 2004.  
     
      
    4 Mr Chahine was convicted of robbery in company contrary to s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence that was alleged to have occurred on 4 June 2001. Mr Chahine pleaded not guilty and was convicted after a five day trial.  
     
      
    5 Mr Chahine raises four grounds on the appeal against conviction and three grounds on sentencing.  
     
      
    6 The grounds are:a There was a miscarriage of justice due to the incompetence of trial counsel;b The trial judge erred in directing the jury that the trial was a re-trial without adequately explaining the implications of that direction; 
     
      
    c The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to joint criminal enterprise;d The verdicts were unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence;e The sentence imposed should be reduced because:i. The sentence is manifestly excessive;ii. The sentencing judge misapplied s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; and iii. The sentencing judge erred in not finding special circumstances. 
     
      
       
        
       
      Facts 
       
      
    7 At around 4 pm on 4 June 2001, two males robbed the St George Bank at Revesby. In the course of the robbery, one of the robbers was hit on the leg when a security screen was activated as he was jumping into the teller area. The robbery was in the amount of $16,585 and was caught on surveillance photos. The surveillance photos do not distinctly identify the appellant. It was alleged, at trial, that the appellant was the robber that jumped into the teller area and was hit by the security screen. The descriptions of this robber were, not unusually, a little different. The teller who was farthest away described him as “slim, very tall and dressed in dark or black clothing with something wrapped around his head”. A teller who was slightly closer described him as “slim to medium build, medium to tall in height … wearing sun glasses, a beanie and … a black part of material covering his mouth.” A person working nearest to the front door of the bank described him as being “quite young, very tanned, quite slender, around 6 feet tall with a prominent jaw line and prominent lips, and that he was wearing blue jeans, a tan belt, sneakers, a navy blue baseball cap and dark sunglasses.” This robber told everyone in the area to get down and demanded money. He also asked for the safe to be opened; started pulling open the drawers and taking money which he placed in his pants. A customer in the bank said he had seen two males outside the branch before he had gone into the bank and that one had a shirt over his face and that the other had a hood over his head. He was at the rear of the bank when the robbery occurred; heard the security screens go up and saw one of the males “wearing a red sports jumper and telling everyone to get down”.  
     
      
    8 Both males left the bank and climbed into a Nissan 200 ZX which was parked directly outside and in which there was a driver, also male. The customer wrote down the registration number. The car was followed for a short time and then lost. The car had been stolen from the Westfield car park in Hurstville some time after 2 pm that day.  
     
      
    9 At approximately 4.20 pm (i.e. within approximately 15 minutes of the robbery) the motor vehicle was located in Punchbowl parked outside a house. It had a smashed passenger window and damage to the ignition. The police saw three males walk to the motor vehicle from the driveway of the units in front of which the car was parked. The appellant, wearing a grey coloured top and black pants, opened the driver’s door and sat inside. The police drove their car up to the Nissan parking in front of it at an angle which prevented the Nissan from being driven away. The police officer opened his door, drew his pistol, pointed it at one of the alleged co-offenders and yelled “Police, police, get on the ground.” 
     
      
    10 At this point, the appellant got out of the Nissan and went to the footpath via the back of the car near the other two co-offenders. The police gave evidence that each saw a bundle of $10 notes fall onto the roadway as the accused got out of the car and walked towards the back. A $50 note was also located on the ground. The appellant raised his arm and yelled out “Juvenile, Juvenile”. One of the police officers restrained one co-offender while the other police officer restrained the other co-offender. While the police officers were doing this, the appellant ran up the driveway of the premises next to those from which he had come and sought to go over the fence moving up the street, away from the premises at which he was originally seen. One of the police officers said that he saw a large amount of money go up into the air; the other said that the appellant was throwing a large amount of money into the air as he was jumping the fence. The money ended up strewn all over the driveway and the garden bed and that amount included a number of cash notes and bank binders. Other police chased the appellant who was ultimately apprehended and arrested. At the time of his arrest, the appellant was wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans. He had long hair, which was tied back.  
     
      
    11 Later that evening police searched a particular unit in the block which was the premises where the appellant was first seen. They retrieved a number of items of clothing, one of which was a navy blue baseball cap and also found a bank slip binder on the floor.  
     
      
    12 The evidence before the Court below was that the trip from the St George Bank at Revesby to the address at which the car was found took, at 60km per hour, 11 minutes and 30 seconds.  
     
      
    13 Inside the Nissan, police located a Nokia mobile phone and a blue jumper. The use of the mobile phone was linked to the appellant.  
     
      
    14 A DNA sample was obtained from the cap located in the search of the premises; this DNA was from three different contributors. The appellant could not be excluded as a contributor and the evidence was that about 1 in 1,200 people could have contributed that DNA. The expert who had conducted the DNA tests, was cross-examined about the possibility of the DNA having been found on the cap because of a “secondary transfer” of the DNA rather than direct contact. The Crown expert did not agree that that was a real possibility.  
     
      
    15 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. I will need to return to this at a later time. Rather, the defence case was conducted by way of cross-examination of the police officers and other witnesses together with the calling of an expert being a molecular geneticist who gave evidence about the secondary transfer of the DNA and disagreed with the Crown expert that such an occurrence could be discounted in the present situation. The cross-examination of the witnesses included cross-examination on the basis that there had been no money that had fallen from the appellant or that was thrown into the air as the fence was scaled.  
     
      
    16 Evidence was also given by one of the police officers that they had told the appellant at Bankstown Police Station: “We have photographs of the offenders and one is wearing the same shoes as yours.” Shortly thereafter, the appellant sought to swap his shoes with another prisoner.  
     
      
    17 As earlier stated, the appellant did not give evidence. As a consequence, there was no evidence from the appellant:  
     
      
    · Denying any involvement in the robbery;· Explaining his presence at the unit;· Explaining his position in relation to the red Nissan outside the unit;· Denying that he dropped money on the driveway as he went past police;· Denying that he threw money when he was climbing the fence;· Explaining the presence of the phone in the red Nissan;· Giving evidence about the baseball cap which the Crown alleged was worn by the appellant during the robbery;· Explaining why he tried to swap his shoes when he was in custody at the police station.  
     
      
       
      But each of these matters were plainly raised through the cross examination of each relevant witness. 
       
      
    18 I will deal firstly with the conviction appeal and then the sentencing appeal, ground by ground. I deal with the grounds on conviction in reverse order.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The Verdicts were Unreasonable and Incapable of being Supported by the Evidence 
       
      
    19 The written submissions of Counsel on behalf of the appellant are informative on this issue, not because of the issue itself, but rather because of the impact that it has on the first ground of appeal. They were:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “[39] The appellant contends that a jury acting reasonably and properly ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt so as to warrant appellate intervention … 
        
       
       
        
        [40] It is submitted that whilst the Crown case may have been reasonably strong on the charge of accessory after the fact to robbery in company, it was weak in relation to the charge in relation to charge of robbery in company.  
        
       
       
        
        [41] The appellant relies on the following: 
        
       
      
    § There was no identification of the offenders;· There was no fingerprint evidence linking the appellant to the offence;· There was no evidence from any of the eye witnesses that one of the offenders had a ponytail. The appellant was observed to have a ponytail when he was arrested;· The bank employee … described the man (alleged to be the appellant by the Crown) as wearing a navy blue baseball cap. The appellant was not excluded as being a contributor to the DNA on the red baseball cap that was found;· Evidence of the police officers in relation to the dropping of money was inconsistent, but in any event capable only of making out a charge of accessory after the fact to robbery.” 
     
      
    20 Each of the above dot points is an accurate summary so far as it goes. During the course of his oral submissions, Mr Terracini SC for the appellant sought to amend this ground so that it was to read in a way which confined it to circumstances where the appellant had been able to give an explanation.  
     
      
    21 The apparent reason for that attempt to rewrite ground 4 is that, on its face, it is inconsistent with ground 1 of the appeal. In dealing with ground 1, which is based upon an alleged refusal to allow the appellant to give evidence, Mr Terracini SC described the Crown case in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ …it was, in my submission, an overwhelming case, and there were no prospects, on any rational assessment of the material, that the jury could accept a version if he did not give one.” 
        
       
      
    22 Notwithstanding the submissions of Counsel for the appellant, the Crown case against the appellant was not overwhelming. It was also not weak. Each of those descriptions have been used by Counsel.  
     
      
    23 A challenge to the jury’s verdict raises for consideration principles that have been discussed on a number of occasions. The most often used passage is that from the joint judgment in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, which was considered, again, by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. His Honour Justice McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Simpson J and I agreed on these principles) summarised the tests in the following way in R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223: 
     
      
       
        
        Section 6(1) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        provides as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Although the application of the section has at times proved troublesome it was authoritatively considered by the High Court in  
        MFA v The Queen  
        (2002) 213 CLR 606,  
        M v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 487 and  
        Jones v The Queen  
        (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493. 
         
         
        There are two joint judgments in  
        MFA.  
        Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ state that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in  
        M: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.’ … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … In  
        MFA  
        the High Court was concerned with whether the analysis of the facts of a trial by this Court was appropriate. In carrying out the appellate task the joint judgment emphasised that it was relevant to identify whether the evidence in the Crown case was ""cogent and unequivocal, and it was not inherently implausible""[30]. The relevant question is whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt"" [36]. 
         
         
        In  
        MFA,  
        McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ joined in a separate judgment. Their Honours emphasised that it was important to focus on the language of s 6(1) which because of the inclusion of the word ""unreasonable"" ""seems to state a very broad test""[47]. However, their Honours point out that the seeming amplitude is to be restricted by the context. Being a verdict of a jury which is given a special place in the law to set it aside involves ""a serious step""[49]. The requirement of the section is that the court must determine whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"" notwithstanding that the jury has returned a guilty verdict. 
         
         
        Embracing the test adopted by the majority of the court in  
        M  
        the joint judgment stated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Instead of asking whether the jury 'must' or were 'bound to' have a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was 'open to the jury' to be satisfied of the accused's guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict 'upon the whole of the evidence' [55]. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The joint judgment offered the following by way of guidance: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The majority in  
          M 
           pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56].’ "" 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 To these principles I added in the same judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[117] … As Gleeson CJ said in a wholly different context:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Depending on the nature of the appeal provided by statute, courts of appeal act according to established principles by which their functions are constrained. Those principles reflect the primacy of the trial process and the practical limitations upon the capacity of a court which does not itself hear the evidence justly to disturb an outcome at first instance. Trial by jury carries with it significant limitations of that kind.’ ( 
          Swain v Waverley Municipal Council 
           (2005) 79 ALJR 565 at 566) 
          
         
         
        [118] In the context of a criminal trial the requirement for finality of factual assessment by a jury must be qualified by the importance of the liberty of the individual and the fundamental requirement of the criminal justice system to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is reconciling those two issues which the judgments of the High Court in  
        M v R 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 and  
        MFA v R 
         (2002) 213 CLR 606 in part address. However, even in that context, in the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in  
        MFA 
         the High Court reminded us that “a ‘verdict of a jury’ particularly in serious criminal cases, is accepted, symbolically, as attracting to decisions concerning the liberty and reputations of accused persons a special authority and legitimacy and hence finality.” (

        [119] Such finality is qualified by the existence of s.6(1) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         only because of the intolerable prospect that if an unreasonable conviction, or one unsupported by the evidence, remains extant, it would be inconsistent with the legitimate exercise of lawful power which the community has come to expect from its legal system. (see  
        MFA 
         at [59]) …  
         
         
        [122] The only other further matter of principle to which I should make reference is the passage from  
        M 
         cited in the Judgment of McClellan AJA at [54]. The Judgment in  
        M v R 
         at 494 insofar as it speaks of a “significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted” is referring, when speaking of an innocent person, to a person of whom it can be said there is not evidence that would satisfy the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See  
        Chamberlain v R 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 495)” 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown case was a circumstantial case and, while there were areas where the evidence could have been stronger, there was sufficient material upon which the jury could convict. In other words, it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt applying the criminal standard of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict upon the whole of the evidence. (see MFA at [55]) 
     
      
    26 It was legitimate for Counsel at the trial to draw attention to the deficiencies in evidence. But inferences to the requisite standard could be drawn and were drawn by the jury. They were faced with the alternative, on all that was before them, of believing that the appellant was involved in the robbery or believing the explanation of the appellant that:· The money ($10,670) found on the driveway and outside the units was planted by police (presumably out of their own money);· Alternatively, all the police were lying about the money;· It was sheer coincidence that he was in the premises immediately after the robbery with two others;· Alternatively, he was merely an accessory and not a person involved in the robbery who had left within the 5 minutes in question;· The DNA on the cap was transferred from material with which the cap had come in contact;· The attempt to swap shoes was not evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
       
      There was other evidence but this is the material the appellant would have sought to explain, if he had been called to give evidence. 
       
      
    27 The jury found, and was entitled to find, that all the circumstances together proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant had committed the crime.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Misdirection as to Joint Criminal Enterprise 
       
      
    28 Counsel submitted that a passage of the direction of the trial judge misdirected the jury and directed them to find guilt and/or particular facts. In pressing this submission, Counsel for the appellant quoted a paragraph in the trial judge’s summation from page 7 (see later) and a further paragraph at page 9. In fact, all of the paragraphs in between those cited by counsel dealt with the directions given to the jury on the question of joint criminal enterprise or common purpose. In the course of it, his Honour dealt with the necessity, in order to find a joint criminal enterprise, that persons had reached an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. He made clear that it was not necessary that such understanding or arrangement be expressed or that evidence be given of the particulars of the conversation. His Honour made clear to the jury that they were entitled to look at the facts as they occurred, namely, the stealing of a car a short time before the robbery, that the driver was sitting in the car waiting for two men who went in to rob the bank, then left the bank, got into the car and drove off. He then made clear that, if the jury found such an agreement existed, each of those three men (the two that went into the bank and the driver) would have been guilty of robbery in company. He made it clear that in those circumstances “it is the law that the man sitting in the car is as guilty as the man who climbed through into the back area of the bank and took, actually scooped up the money and took it out.” It is in that context that his Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So in this case, members of the jury, it is not necessary for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was the accused who actually went through to the back. It is, of course, the Crown’s case that he was the man. But if you were satisfied that he was one of the persons, one of the two that went into the bank, then, or even that he was the man driving the car, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the circumstances presented by the Crown’s case that to be the situation, it would be an appropriate case for you to return a verdict of guilty.” 
        
       
       
      It is the above passage about which complaint is made. 
       
      
    29 As I understand the submission of Counsel on this ground, it is that in the last sentence of the immediately preceding quote his Honour directed in a way which “implicitly encompassed a finding of fact by the trial judge that the Crown evidence (if accepted) constituted proof of a joint criminal enterprise.” That submission takes his Honour’s comments out of context. His Honour had immediately prior thereto said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be expressed, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached any particular time before the crime was committed.  
        
       
       
        
        Now applying that to this case, members of the jury, as I said, where [I think this should be whether] there was an agreement between the three people involved is a matter which you will have to decide. There is no one who has come before you to say that they heard these three men discussing a proposed robbery at some house some distance away, and it is not necessary that that evidence need be given, because you are entitled to look at the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    30 While there are some comments on the facts that, if one disregarded the context, may have been put less neutrally than they might have been, there is nothing in the direction to the jury which was impermissible when taken in the context of the whole of the summing up. It is informative to remind oneself of the passage in RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] Before parting with the case, it is as well to say something more general about the difficult task trial judges have in giving juries proper instructions. The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the facts in the case. No doubt, that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions, it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and the relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before jury the case which the accused makes. In some cases it will require the judge to warn the jury about how they should  
        not 
         reason or about particular care that must be shown before accepting certain kinds of evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        [42] But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases, a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task and, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment, and comment strongly on factual issues.” 
        
       
      
    31 Whatever comments may have been made by the trial judge in his directions to the jury, they were not such, in this area, that the task of ensuring a fair trial was compromised.  
     
      
    32 It should be noted that this matter was not one raised by Counsel at the trial. Counsel did raise with his Honour that it would not be open to the jury, on the Crown case, to return a verdict on a finding that the accused was the driver of the vehicle. That submission was not based upon whether the driver of the vehicle was part of a common purpose but rather that there was no evidence that the accused was in fact the driver of the vehicle.  
     
      
    33 In all the circumstances, this ground fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Direction as to Re-Trial 
       
      
    34 It was put to one of the police officer witnesses in cross-examination that there were prior proceedings in that court the year before the cross-examination occurred. There was cross-examination as to one or more alleged differences between the evidence given in this trial and the evidence given on the prior occasion. At the conclusion of the evidence, his Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, there’s been some questions asked of this witness and some earlier witnesses, I think, about evidence given in this Court on an earlier occasion. The situation is that this is a re-trial. So I just inform you of this situation.”  
        
       
      
    35 Complaint is made about that statement by his Honour because, it is said, his Honour should have explained to the jury that the first trial did not proceed to finality.  
     
      
    36 There is evidence before the Court that in the first trial of the appellant, the trial judge discharged the jury without allowing them to conclude their deliberations. The reason for that is irrelevant now, but it seems that the first trial judge became unavailable.  
     
      
    37 It is submitted that the unexplained information by his Honour, quoted above, would have caused speculation by the jury that the appellant had been previously convicted of the charge but had managed to secure a re-trial on appeal. I find the logic of this submission difficult to follow. The only time a re-trial would be ordered on appeal is because there is some miscarriage of justice which vitiates the finding of the jury. On one view, at least, a new trial ordered on appeal may be a far more favourable reason for the accused than a jury (or one of its members) being unable to make up its mind. However the submission presupposes far too much. Firstly, it assumes that jurors would know the reasons why re-trials occurred. Secondly, it assumes that a jury may discriminate between reasons for a retrial in a manner unfavourable to the accused. Thirdly, it assumes, in the context of a trial, that a far greater significance be ascribed to the comment by his Honour than it deserves. Given the cross-examination on prior statements, it was not inappropriate for his Honour to explain that this was a re-trial. This was done immediately after the evidence had been given. It was part way through the third day of the trial and there were another two days of evidence and submissions.  
     
      
    38 In my opinion, this comment by his Honour could have had no effect on the deliberations of the jury and, to the extent that a juror was familiar enough with the legal process to discriminate between a re-trial after a hung jury and after a successful appeal, such a juror would have no need to speculate, contrary to the appellant’s submission, and such a juror would be aware that in either case there had been some unfairness or lack of result in the proceeding, warranting the second trial. Common sense would hold that there would be no need for the second trial if the appellant had already been convicted. It is simply unbelievable that a jury would take a view inconsistent with that proposition. The trial judge, both at the opening of the trial and at the opening of the directions, emphasised that it was the jury, and the jury alone, which had the responsibility of deciding the facts and that such decision must be based upon the evidence adduced before them and nothing more.  
     
      
    39 This ground has no substance.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: There was a Miscarriage of Justice due to the Incompetence of Trial Counsel 
       
      
    40 This ground depends upon the proposition that the appellant’s counsel at trial ought to have called the appellant and refused to do so in circumstances where the appellant had requested on a number of occasions to give evidence and been refused. These reasons on that issue will also deal, to the extent necessary, with the amended ground 4, i.e. as sought to be amended in counsel’s addresses: namely, the claim that it would have been a verdict which was unsafe and unsatisfactory, had the appellant given evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    41 For the purposes of advancing this claim, evidence was called and cross examination occurred as to the nature of the instructions obtained by Counsel in the course of the trial.  
     
      
    42 The appellant gave evidence on appeal twice, the later time after it was made clear by the Court that evidence had not been adduced from him as to that which he would have said if he had been called at the trial.  
     
      
    43 The affidavit filed for the appellant said in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] About one or two weeks before the trial Jack Rigg [the instructing solicitor] came to visit me at Parklea Gaol and we had a conversation. During our conversation words to the following effect were said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Jack Rigg said: ‘As you know they’re saying they’ve got DNA on you on the cap. We’ll have to get our own expert.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said: ‘OK.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        During the meeting I raised my concerns about the Crown evidence that a mobile phone supposed to belong to me was found in the car which was allegedly used in the robbery.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said: ‘Look, about the mobile phone, it doesn’t look good for me and I have to explain how it got there. I want to give evidence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Jack Rigg said: ‘No. No. No. I don’t think you should. It will just open doors.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [5] As mentioned above, my trial commenced on 23 June 2004. On the second day of the trial, 24 June 2004, Detective Hart gave evidence about the phone that was found in the car by police that was alleged to be my mobile phone. After that evidence, I had a conversation with Greg Stanton [the appellant’s Counsel at trial] during a break in the trial. During our conversation, words to the following effect were said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said: ‘I want to get up on the stand and tell the jury about how the phone got into the car.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Greg Stanton said: ‘No, don’t worry. That’s the least of your problems.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I also said: ‘He’s lying about the money. I didn’t have no money. The money they found was no where near where I jumped the fence. I want to explain that to the jury.’ (My reference to ‘he’ was a reference to Detective Hart)  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Greg Stanton: ‘It’s been explained. The jury knows that he’s lying anyway.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [6] I had a further conversation with Greg Stanton on 29 June 2004 in relation to me giving evidence. That was the day I heard the evidence of Vivien Beilby, the Crown DNA witness and my DNA expert, Dr Brian McDonald. … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I said: ‘Look, I’ve been to Hammoud’s house. I’ve slept there. I’ve eaten there. I’ve worn his clothes. He’s wore my clothes. We were good friends. I should tell the jury that so that they know that I’ve been there and I could of wore the hat.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Greg Stanton said: ‘Don’t worry about that.’ … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [7] At no time during the trial did I sign any document saying I had decided not to give evidence and at no time was I asked to sign such a document. At no time was it explained to me, nor did I understand why I should not give evidence. I just went along with what I was told which was that I shouldn’t give evidence in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    44 The other material upon which the appellant relies was that after the trial, the appellant terminated the services of both Mr Stanton and Mr Rigg. Other counsel was retained, as was another solicitor. They appeared for the appellant in the sentencing proceedings. Different counsel and solicitor have appeared on the appeal.  
     
      
    45 During the course of the sentencing proceedings, the appellant was asked, on oath, and answered in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Do you acknowledge your guilt in this matter? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yes I do.” 
        
       
      
    46 Evidence was then given as to the change in his life since the offence, and the likelihood of re-offence. Further, in the course of sentencing, the witness signed a Form 1 in which the appellant sought to have taken into account the offence of being “carried in a conveyance taken without consent of owner” being the red Nissan 200 SX to which reference has been made in the course of these reasons. The only time that could have occurred was in the few hours which included the time of the robbery. Evidence was adduced from each of the legal practitioners representing the appellant prior to the appeal. With one notable exception, those legal practitioners could not remember a large amount of the detail without access to the files which, mostly, they did not have. Otherwise the evidence was relatively consistent. The most relevant evidence was given by Mr Greg Stanton who was cross-examined. That evidence recited that Mr Stanton had given advice as to the calling of the DNA evidence by the appellant and that advice was given, after discussion with Mr Rigg, to Mr Chahine and certain members of his family. Further, Mr G Stanton was cross-examined by Mr Terracini SC on behalf or the appellant and the following evidence was adduced: 
     
      
       
        
        “The instructions which I had were that Mr Chahine was not present at the robbery. Mr Chahine had not physically been within the unit in the block of flats from which the Crown said he had emerged on the day in question and that he had not discarded anything from his body, his pockets when he was decamping from police at the scene just before his arrest. … They were the instructions which I had, and I ran the trial accordingly. There was no alibi issue and that was the extent of it, sir.” 
        
       
       
      The following exchange occurred between Mr Terracini SC and Mr G Stanton in the course of questioning: 
       
       
        
        “Q: As I understand it, no evidence was called to provide an explanation as to the presence of the accused, the then accused, at the scene and his alleged involvement in it? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Which scene? 
        
       
       
        
        Q: At the scene of the robbery? 
        
       
       
        
        A: At the bank? (The transcript does not adequately show the incredulity of Counsel being questioned as to the nature of that enquiry) 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And thereafter there was no evidence called to explain where he was, what he did, etc? 
        
       
       
        
        A: He denied, in instructions, that he was one of the persons depicted in the video camera surveillance, images captured and available to the Crown and its case. He couldn’t provide an alibi and accordingly, no alibi was adduced, and there was a serious issue of identification, which he, as an accused would be, as was Mr Doudar, entitled to seize upon. There was no positive identification by any Crown witness of Mr Chahine as a person they claimed, either by line up, photo or video identification, to be one of the persons responsible for the robbery. The Crown relied almost entirely, not in terms of his allegedly being seen at the robbery, upon clothing and footwear.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: And a mobile phone? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Not at all. It was never said, at any stage, as I recall it, not having had access to the brief for some time, that Mr Chahine was either carrying or using a mobile phone at the bank. Indeed, whilst I don’t agree that the specific conversation between myself and Chahine took place in relation to the mobile phone referred to in his affidavit, I was certainly of the view then and, on reflection I haven’t changed my view, the mobile phone wasn’t a critical issue in the Crown’s case, and it was certainly – to quote his words – the least of his problems, attributed to him. That phone, on the Crown case, simply was a connecting point to Mr Chahine at some stage, either before, during or after the robbery, but it’s use in the commission of the crime was never said to be a matter available to the Crown as evidence and I think I addressed upon that at some length.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he indicate to you that he wanted to give an explanation to the jury about certain issues in the case? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Yes, and I did, as I did in the first trial, advise him strongly that that would be unwise and an unwarranted course of action for him to take.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he indicate on a number of occasions that he wanted to give evidence? 
        
       
       
        
        A: No. There were no more than two occasions on the second trial. Mr Chahine was extremely confident and satisfied with the appearance that I had made on his behalf and his co-accused, as he then was, Mr Doudar, in respect of the first trial. He gave no evidence in the first trial, again on advice, and the issues on the second trial, the re-trial, were effectively no different and I gave him no different advice on the second trial.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he indicate to you he wanted to have it explained to him why he shouldn’t give evidence? 
        
       
       
        
        A: I gave Mr Chahine an explanation as to those matters without his need to ask me for that explanation.” 
        
       
      
    47 To the extent that there is a conflict between the evidence of the appellant and the evidence of Mr G Stanton, I prefer the evidence of Mr G Stanton. Notwithstanding the time since the trial, his memory of the events was reliable and believable. On the other hand, notwithstanding a very mild cross-examination of the appellant, his evidence was, in part, unbelievable. I do not believe, in particular, that he understood the Form 1 document was a psychological report. I do not accept that Mr G Stanton did not give advice concerning whether Mr Chahine should be called to give evidence. It is not surprising that Mr Chahine, during the second trial, would rely largely on the same approach as occurred in the first trial which resulted in an acquittal in the case of his co-accused and in which, in relation to the appellant, the jury was discharged without verdict. Further, the calling by the defence of its own DNA expert to testify about transferred DNA is inconsistent with the explanation of the appellant given on appeal.48 I do not use the testimony given at sentencing, or the Form 1, as evidence of Mr Chahine’s guilt. I am prepared to look at the issue of the trial on the facts as they existed at the time of the trial. I do, however, use the Form 1 and the evidence on sentencing as material going to the credit of Mr Chahine in his evidence on appeal.  
     
      
    49 On the evidence before this Court, the overwhelming impression is that counsel, Mr G Stanton, took a deliberate forensic course relying on the very matters raised by the appellant in this appeal which go to the weakness of the Crown case. It was, after all, for the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Having heard Mr Chahine being cross-examined, albeit mildly, I have little doubt that such advice was correct.  
     
      
    50 In order for the appellant to go behind the conduct of his trial by counsel and the decisions taken in the running of that trial, he must show not only error by counsel but a miscarriage of justice and/or an unfair trial. Viewed objectively, not calling the appellant was a rational, tactical decision made to avoid forensic risk which did not result in a material irregularity or the loss of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. (See TKWJ v R (2002) 212 CLR 124; R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510; R v Moussa (No. 2) (2002) 134 A Crim R 296)  
     
      
    51 This ground of appeal is also rejected. As a consequence of the rejection of the grounds of appeal against conviction, it is necessary to deal with the question of sentence.  
     
      
       
      Manifest Excess 
       
      
    52 The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of seven and a half years and a balance of term of two and a half years. The term of imprisonment commenced on 15 March 2003.  
     
      
    53 The maximum penalty for the offence, being a contravention of s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, is 20 years’ imprisonment. The offence was committed while the appellant was on parole for a prior offence of the same kind. For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and six months with a non-parole period of 20 months. That earlier robbery was committed whist on a good behaviour bond. He has a significant criminal history and his Honour was to take into account the matter on the Form 1. It must be said that the matter on the Form 1 was a necessary part of the principal offence and his Honour seems to have given that due weight by, seemingly, not requiring any or any substantial enhancement of his assessment of an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    54 It is clear that the sentencing judge treated the offences very seriously; threats were made, although the bank robbers were not armed.  
     
      
    55 I accept that the sentence imposed is at the higher end of the range for this offence, but consider that it was within his Honour’s proper sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    56 It is clear that his Honour treated the appellant’s prior offences, together with the circumstance that the offence was committed while he was on parole for an offence of the same kind, as requiring condign punishment and far less mercy or concentration on rehabilitation.  
     
      
       
      Special Circumstances 
       
      
    57 Shillington DCJ declined to find special circumstances. The determination by a sentencing judge that there are or are not special circumstances requiring a departure from the specified statutory ratio of non-parole period to the term of the sentence is one almost entirely within the discretion of the sentencing judge. It would be unusual for the Court to intervene on the basis of a sentencing judge refusing to find special circumstances, or more accurately, refusing to find such special circumstances that require a lesser non-parole period. It would require evidence that the discretionary exercise miscarried (i.e. there was an error of principle or manifest error). The situation in this appeal does not warrant an interference with his Honour’s exercise of discretion.  
     
      
       
      Failure to take into account Section 21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       
      
    58 The submission made on behalf of the appellant, in relation to this ground relies upon the statements made by this Court, on a number of occasions, that an unexplained reference to the criteria adumbrated in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is unsatisfactory. In this case, however, the sentencing judge made no reference to s.21A as such. His Honour, an extremely experienced sentencing judge, paid regard to each of the relevant factors without denoting that some or all of them may be listed in s.21A. Such an approach discloses no error. The appellant does not point to any factor misused by his Honour or any factor not used in favour of the appellant that should have been used.  
     
      
    59 In the circumstances, I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
    a Appeal against conviction dismissed;b Leave to appeal against sentence granted;c Appeal against sentence dismissed.

    1 GROVE J: As Howie J has recorded the Court dismissed this Crown appeal and indicated that it would give reasons later. I have read his Honour’s reasons in draft and I express my agreement and would adopt them as my reasons for joining in the order made on 3 April. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: After the hearing of this matter the Court made an order dismissing the appeal and indicated it would give its reasons later. These are my reasons for joining in that order. 
     
      
    4 This was an appeal by the Crown under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against sentences imposed upon the respondent by Judge Geraghty (the Judge) for two offences of supplying a prohibited drug. Each of the offences was contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years is prescribed. The respondent was sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of 13 months and a balance of term of 12 months. The Judge ordered that the sentences be served concurrently and by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    5 The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court during the course of committal proceedings and after some agreement was reached as to the charges for which the respondent should be committed to the District Court. Each offence alleged that between 25 October and 5 November 2004 the respondent supplied a prohibited drug. The first charge concerned methylamphetamine in the form commonly known as “ice” and the second charge related to ecstasy. There was an agreed statement of facts tendered to the court. Although the Judge did not set out the facts he found in the course of his sentencing remarks, it is necessary to do so for the purpose of this appeal. 
     
      
    6 The charges against the respondent arose from investigations by police between July and November 2004 into allegations of fraud during which a number of telephone calls were lawfully intercepted. As a result of these interceptions the respondent was identified as being involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
      
    7 The first charge related to 500 tablets of methylamphetamine supplied by the respondent on 28 October 2004. On that day a co-offender named Cheng received a telephone call from a man named Ng who said that he wanted to buy 500 tablets. Cheng said that he would organise it and they agreed to meet in the city later that afternoon. A short time later Cheng telephoned the respondent who told Cheng that he could supply the tablets. Cheng indicated to the respondent that he was going to call Ng back and was later to go into the city. He suggested that the respondent accompany him. The respondent told Cheng to tell the buyer to come to the respondent's home but Ng was not prepared to do so. Cheng and Ng agreed to meet in the city at about 6:30pm. At about 5:30pm Cheng rang the respondent and told him that they were selling the tablets for $15.50 per tablet. Cheng told the respondent he would confirm the deal and asked him to hold the tablets. Later Cheng called the respondent who asked him to obtain the money from the buyer and then to come and see him. The respondent would go to meet the buyer with the tablets. This arrangement proved unsuitable to Ng so that eventually the respondent and Cheng met Ng in the city and the respondent supplied him with the tablets. 
     
      
    8 The second charge concerned the supply of 300 tablets of ecstasy on 2 November 2004. The respondent supplied the tablets to Cheng and a third person named Mullally who together on-sold the tablets to another man named Lim. In the evening of 1 November, Mullally phoned Lim and asked him whether he wanted ecstasy tablets. Lim arranged to buy 300 of the tablets at a price of $16.50 per tablet. At about 8:45pm on 2 November Cheng telephoned the respondent and said that he wanted 300 tablets. Cheng then went to the respondent's home and received the drug. In the early hours of 3 November, Mullally contacted Cheng and told him that Lim was not happy with the quality of the tablets and wanted to exchange them. At about 5:00am Cheng telephoned the respondent and told him that Lim either wanted to return the tablets or to swap them for something else. Cheng asked what the respondent wanted him to do. The respondent agreed to take half of the tablets back. A short time later Cheng telephoned the respondent to find out the name of the tablets. He said that he thought that he could convince Lim to keep the tablets but was concerned that people using the tablets were not being affected. He asked the respondent whether the tablets had come from a reliable source and the respondent indicated that they had. Later Cheng rang the respondent and told him that Lim had agreed to keep the tablets. 
     
      
    9 In addition to the two charges before the court the respondent asked the sentencing judge to take into account, when sentencing him for the first offence, three matters on a Form 1. Each of these matters arose on 1 September 2004 when the police spoke to the respondent in relation to his driving. The respondent acted in a manner that led the police to suspect him of some wrongdoing and he was asked to get out of the motor vehicle. As he did a resealable packet dropped to the ground. The respondent was asked to empty his pockets and produced an amount of $4,300 which he told police he had won on poker machines at a hotel. When police indicated they would check the video footage at the hotel, the respondent admitted that he had not been there. The respondent was searched and five resealable plastic bags containing drugs were located on him. Police also found a notepad containing several figures noting weight and cash amounts labelled with the words ""purchased"" and ""profit"". The plastic bags were found to contain 3.55gms of methylamphetamine in four of the bags and 0.10gms of cocaine in the fifth.  
     
      
    10 As a result of this incident the respondent was charged with goods in custody in relation to the money, supplying a prohibited drug in relation to the methylamphetamine and possess a prohibited drug in relation to the cocaine. These were the matters appearing on the Form 1. The respondent was granted bail on these charges and the two offences for which he was to be sentenced were committed while he was on bail. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s subjective case 
      
    11 The respondent was aged 20 years at the time of the offending and had no prior convictions. He had been in custody on remand for the offences for about three months. He was born in China and came with his family to Australia at the age of nine. His upbringing was strict but the respondent rebelled and entered into conflict with his parents. He commenced truanting from school and fell into poor company. His parents separated in 2003. The respondent worked at an Internet café for about 12 months until his drug dependency became too great and thereafter was unemployed. He commenced using ecstasy in 2003 and amphetamine in 2004 when he ceased using ecstasy. He was using $100 worth of “ice” each day before his arrest. He also maintained that he had a significant gambling habit at the time of his offending. 
     
      
    12 After being released to bail he was reunited with his parents and lived with his father at the time of sentencing. He intended to recommence his education. He had been drug free since being arrested and attending for urine screening which had proved negative for illicit drugs. A psychological report in evidence suggested that the respondent had a personality type that was vulnerable to substance abuse because of a lack of self-confidence as a result of his effeminate appearance. It reported that the respondent had by virtue of his own efforts ceased the use of drugs. The psychologist expressed concern that by reason of his appearance and youth he might be potentially vulnerable to assaults in gaol. There was a report from an employment agency that indicated that the respondent had attended all appointments punctually and had been “keen to get his life back on track”. 
     
      
    13 The respondent’s mother gave evidence before the Judge and expressed the belief that it was her fault that the respondent started taking drugs because she had spoken to him frequently about her troubles. His father gave evidence that the respondent had expressed his regret for his behaviour and had broken his ties with the people with whom he was previously associating. 
     
      
       
      The co-offender 
      
    14 Judge Hock sentenced the co-offender Cheng. He had only one charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of drugs covering the same activity for which the respondent was to be sentenced. Cheng was also sentenced for an offence of dishonesty. Judge Hock described Cheng as a middleman who received $120 for the supply of the $500 tablets. Her Honour found that notwithstanding that his role was “low down in the hierarchy” a full time custodial sentence was warranted. He was 22 years of age and had one prior matter of dishonesty for which he had been sentenced to a term of periodic detention that he had breached. He received a discount of 20 per cent for his plea of guilty. Cheng was sentenced for the supply of drugs to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of ten months and a balance of term of ten months. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing remarks 
      
    15 Judge Geraghty gave the respondent the benefit of a discount of 20 percent for his plea and the Crown does not cavil with that assessment. The Judge accepted that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the respondent was on bail and that they were planned or organised activity. He found in mitigation that the respondent had no previous record and was previously a person of good character. He considered that the respondent was unlikely to offend again. He found special circumstances in that he was “very young and quite immature”, it was his first offence and that he was likely to rehabilitate himself. 
     
      
    16 The Judge held that no other penalty but imprisonment was appropriate and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It does seem to me that it would be an extraordinary case, in which a person pleading guilty and being convicted of supplying drugs to other members of the community, would be treated in other way than by a period of imprisonment. 
        
       
       
      However the Judge also held: 
       
        
         
        Fulltime incarceration, given his youth and his appearance, would likely result in tragic consequences. 
         
        
       
      
    17 In a report to this Court the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In view of his age, the fact that this was his first offence, and because his youthful appearance would make him as especially vulnerable in a prison setting, I was reluctant to impose a full-time custodial sentence. I considered that a sentence of periodic detention is a safer option in the circumstances, as well as constituting both a specific and general deterrent. 
        
       
       
      Asserted errors 
      
    18 The Crown submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate but also pointed to what it said were specific errors that might explain why the sentence was so lenient as to be outside the legitimate range of the Judge’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
       
      (a) failure to find facts 
      
    19 The first was that the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the role played by the respondent. The Judge said nothing at all about the facts of the offences other than to refer to the existence of the statement of facts. The Crown asserted that the Judge was in error in not making some finding as to the role of the respondent particularly in light of the fact that he had to consider the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Cheng for the purpose of parity. The Crown argued that had the Judge considered this issue he would have inevitably found that the respondent was at a level above the co-offender in the drug hierarchy as the respondent had control of the drugs and was giving Cheng directions. 
     
      
    20 Ms Francis, who appears for the respondent on this appeal, submitted that the Judge must have been seized of the facts because he referred to the statement of facts and the sentence imposed by Judge Hock. She also submitted that the Crown did not rely upon the greater role of the respondent at the hearing but rather conceded that a sentence of less than three years was open in light of the sentence imposed upon Cheng. In any event it was argued that the statement of facts did not disclose that the respondent did have a more serious role. 
     
      
       
      (b) failure to take into account the Form 1 matters 
      
    21 The Crown argued that, although the Judge stated that he was taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he could not have done so. The Crown pointed out that each of the sentences imposed upon the respondent were identical in length and yet the offences on the Form 1 were of sufficient seriousness that some adjustment to the sentence in respect of which they were taken into account was necessary to reflect them. The Judge did not, as he ought to have done, indicate on which offence the matters were being taken into account. 
     
      
    22 The respondent argued that, although it might appear at first blush that the first sentence did not reflect the matters on the Form 1, the respondent had served a period of three months in custody in respect of the first offence and, therefore, there was a distinction in the two sentences. It was argued that the overall sentence for the first offence was thus 28 months with a non-parole period of 16 months. 
     
      
       
      (c) too much weight given to respondent’s subjective matters 
       
      (d) error in ordering sentence served by periodic detention 
      
    23 These asserted errors were argued together. The Crown submitted that the only reason that the sentence was imposed by way of periodic detention was because of the respondent’s subjective circumstances. The Crown argued that there was nothing in the psychologist’s report or in the other subjective factors that permitted the Judge to depart from a full-time custodial sentence. It was said that the Judge was in error in imposing periodic detention on the basis that the respondent was more at risk in the gaol environment and that full time incarceration “would likely result in tragic consequences”. 
     
      
    24 Ms Francis argued that because the respondent had served 3 months in custody and because of his subjective case, the Judge was entitled to order periodic detention notwithstanding that she concedes a full time custodial sentence would be required except in exceptional circumstances. She also emphasised that the Judge acknowledged the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
       
      (e) failure to accumulate 
      
    25 The Crown argued that the Judge ought to have accumulated the sentences for the two offences as there was no commonality other than the offenders involved. It submitted that making the sentences the same length and ordering that they be served concurrently resulted in the overall sentence being manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    26 Ms Francis relied in answer to the discretion that resides in a court to decide whether offences should be made cumulative or concurrent. She pointed to the fact that the prosecutor at the sentencing hearing conceded that “the Crown can see why the Court would decline to accumulate these two sentences”. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
      
    27 It was my opinion the sentences were manifestly inadequate. There has been a consistent line of authority in this Court that has made it quite clear that, unless there are truly exceptional circumstances present, a full-time custodial sentence ought to be imposed wherever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs; see R v Blanco (NSWCCA, unreported, 22 October 1987). It applies whether or not the offender has made a profit from the supply of drugs and a profit is an aggravating circumstance: R v Clarke (NSWCCA, unreported, 15 March 1990). Efforts at reform and rehabilitation since the offending will not generally be regarded as amounting to exceptional circumstances: R v Thompson (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 April 1994). The policy behind this line of authority has been held to be a rule to which sentencing judges must give serious consideration: R v Cacciola (1998) 104 A Crim R 178. It has been most recently referred to by Hulme J in R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398. 
     
      
    28 There was no acknowledgment of this line of authority in the sentencing remarks of the Judge. Rather, with respect, the Judge appeared to have equated a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention with a full time custodial sentence otherwise it was impossible to see how he was taking into account parity with the co-offender as he said he was. It was my opinion that there was nothing in the subjective circumstances of the respondent that was sufficiently exceptional to justify anything but a full time custodial sentence. The fact that the respondent had spent about three months in custody did not satisfy the need for general deterrence. The sentence was so inadequate as to be unreasonable: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048. 
     
      
    29 It was clear in my view that the Judge had insufficient regard to the facts and made no attempt to identify where the respondent stood in relation to his co-offender. The Judge had to undertake that task, not only to assess the applicant’s criminality, but also to determine the issue of parity. In my opinion it was plain that those facts reveal the respondent to be higher in the supply chain than was Cheng. It was to the respondent that Cheng came when Lim indicated he was not satisfied with the quality of the drugs. Cheng asked the respondent what he wanted him to do about it. I accepted that the respondent was obtaining the drugs from some other person, but he was nearer the source of supply than Cheng. 
     
      
    30 It was also my opinion that, despite what he said and the fact that he signed the Form 1, the Judge did not take those matters properly into account. Ms Francis’s submission that the Judge used the period of three months in custody as being the differential between the two sentences by reason of the Form 1 matters could be accepted. The Judge ought to have properly assessed the seriousness of those matters and made it patent in his sentencing remarks how he was taking them into account and upon what sentence they were being taken into account. It was not satisfactory for the offender, the Crown or this Court to be left to speculate or conjecture about the manner in which the Judge derived the sentences he did. The supply offence on the Form 1 was a relatively serious matter. It was part of on-going supply of drugs as the notebook makes clear. The quantity of drug was over the trafficable quantity and was different from the type of drugs he was supplying in the offences to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    31 In any event it seemed to me that the Judge must have taken as a starting sentence for each offence a period of 3 years. If this was reduced by 3 months and then 20 per cent deducted, the result was about 26 months. The total sentence imposed for each offence was 25 months. It seemed to me that the respondent received the advantage of having the 3 months served taken off both sentences. This was itself an error. I could only conclude that the Crown submission was correct and the Judge failed actually to take into account the matters on the Form 1 because there was no other explanation for the two sentences being the same length having regard to the seriousness of the matters on the Form 1. 
     
      
    32 It seemed clear from the sentencing remarks that the Judge determined not to impose a full-time custodial sentence only because of his opinion that it “would likely result in tragic consequences”. That appeared to me, with respect, to be an over-reaction and there was insufficient basis for that conclusion. The Judge had made no investigation of whether the respondent could be adequately protected as apparently he was during the three months on remand. The protection of prisoners is the role of the Corrective Services Department. There are facilities available within the corrective establishments to house young vulnerable prisoners and still give them the facilities for rehabilitation. Apart from the psychologist’s view that the offender might be “potentially vulnerable to assault”, there was no evidence that the respondent was at any more risk than many other young and vulnerable prisoners or that he could not be adequately protected. It was an error for the Judge to refuse to impose a full-time custodial sentence that was otherwise warranted on this basis. 
     
      
    33 There was no evidence that the applicant would spend his time in more onerous conditions simply because he may need to be protected. There was none before this Court. The Judge could not make an assumption that he would: R v Durocher-Yvon (2003) 58 NSWLR 581; R v Mostyn (2004) A Crim R 304; R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Counsel appearing for the respondent made no submission to the Judge that he could avoid a full-time custodial sentence because of the respondent’s vulnerability. Nor did counsel submit that the Judge should impose sentences by way of periodic detention. Counsel’s submission was that the Judge could impose a sentence by way of periodic detention for one offence and a “lengthy recognisance” on the other. 
     
      
    34 Insofar as it was asserted that the Judge erred in making the sentences concurrent, the Crown should not be allowed to criticise the Judge for not imposing at least partially cumulative sentences in light of the concession made by the prosecutor at the sentencing proceedings. That concession was based upon the Judge finding that the two offences were part of the one course of conduct. But that is not a fact that is decisive to a determination of whether sentences should be concurrent or accumulative. The question generally will be whether the sentence for one offence can encompass the totality of the criminality reflected in both offences. If it cannot, then it does not matter that the offences were part of the same course of criminal conduct: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. It was my opinion that the penalty for the first offence could not reflect the total criminality of these supplies on two distinct occasions. The sentences should have been partially accumulative but, as this was a Crown appeal, I did not believe that Court should correct that error. 
     
      
    35 The principles upon which this Court considers Crown appeals were summarised in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. There is no need to repeat them here but I took them into account and they were set out in the written submissions for the respondent. But it was my opinion that the sentencing exercise miscarried and the real issue was whether this Court should intervene. The respondent should have received a longer overall sentence than Cheng by reason of his role in the offences, the fact that they were committed while on bail, that they were committed for profit and because of the offences on the Form 1. The submission by the prosecutor that the Judge could impose sentences of three years or less by reason of parity was erroneous. 
     
      
    36 This Court cannot increase a sentence at the behest of the Crown to achieve parity but the fact that the co-offender ended up serving a sentence of full time custody for what I believed to have been a lesser role in the offences indicated the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the respondent. 
     
      
    37 The respondent attended at the hearing of this appeal. He was slightly built but otherwise there was nothing that indicated that he would be more susceptible to violence then any other young man of his kind. There was no reason for the Judge to avoid a sentence of full-time custody because of any special concerns about the respondent’s well being in gaol. If young, vulnerable men want to undertake the risky profession of a drug trafficker, they should understand the consequences if caught and be punished accordingly. 
     
      
    38 It has previously been observed by this Court that a Judge who fails to impose an appropriate sentence for inappropriate reasons does the offender no favour. But more importantly a Judge, who does not perform his duty to impose a sentence of imprisonment where such a sentence is required in the public interest, does the community no favour. No doubt the present respondent has been put to additional anxiety by the Crown appeal hanging over his head. To return him to custody would probably have been harsher for him than had he been sentenced to full time custody by the Judge. There were affidavits before this Court showing that the respondent had continued with his rehabilitation including urine testing. He had been attending periodic detention without blemish. 
     
      
    39 Not without considerable doubt because I believed the sentence was manifestly inadequate in all its aspects, I concluded that the Court should exercise its discretion and dismiss the appeal. This was because of the youth of the respondent, his continuing rehabilitation since having been arrested for these offences and the double jeopardy in returning him to custody. The Judge was permitted to arrive at the position where he could impose periodic detention by inappropriate concessions by the prosecutor.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the respondent who, with his wife, was sentenced after pleading guilty to an indictment which alleged that between 9 October 2002 and 20 December 2002 he supplied a prohibited drug namely heroin being an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act NSW 1985. The maximum penalty for the offence was a term of imprisonment of fifteen years and/or a fine of $220,000. The respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years to commence from 2 May 2005 and expire on 1 May 2007 with a non-parole period of fifteen months. 
     
      
    2 The respondent was charged with his de facto wife, Shayla Ngoc Trang Gip who pleaded guilty to the same offence. She was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years with a non-parole period of one year but the sentence was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Crown has also appealed her sentence. The appeals were heard together. 
     
      
    3 The sentences of both respondents were imposed on 30 August 2005 but it was not until 25 October 2005 that the Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal. It was served on the respondent Ly on 26 October and on the respondent Gip on 1 November 2005. 
     
      
    4 Before the sentencing judge, there was a factual dispute in relation to the extent of the respondents’ drug dealing activities. Although the respondents pleaded guilty to supplying a quantity of 51 grams of heroin, the Crown alleged that the sentencing judge should find that there was a further supply of 3 ounces of heroin on 14 December 2002. 
     
      
    5 The argument before the sentencing judge was concerned with the conclusion which should be drawn from the telephone conversations that had been intercepted. His Honour records the submission of the Crown being that it was enough, having regard to the extended meaning of supply, in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act NSW 1985 that there be an agreement to supply to constitute an offence contrary to s 25. His Honour accepted that proposition but concluded that he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the parties did in fact reach an agreement to supply. His Honour’s conclusion is that although there is evidence which suggests that they did, he could not rule out the possibility that, although there may have been negotiations, they did not conclude an agreement. 
     
      
    6 His Honour’s conclusion that he could not find more than one act of supply was reflected in the approach which he took to the sentences. His Honour referred to the decision of this Court in R v Clark, unreported, NSWCCA (15 March 1990) where it was indicated that general deterrence was of considerable significance when sentencing “drug traffickers.” His Honour also referred to the decision in R v Bardo, unreported, NSWCCA, (14 July 1992) at [1] and concluded after consideration of that decision that “trafficking in a substantial degree was a reference to supply on more than one occasion as the word trafficking denotes.” 
     
      
    7 His Honour’s statement of the relevant principles may reflect a misunderstanding and it is appropriate to restate the principles which this Court has previously laid down. 
     
      
    8 In R v Clark, Hunt J, with whom Sharp J agreed, considered the circumstances of an offender who had pleaded guilty to two charges of supplying amphetamine and also asked that consideration be given to summary offences, one of possession of cannabis and another of administering amphetamines. In this context Hunt J said at [2]-[3]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has, on occasions too numerous to mention, emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and it has indicated that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        That statement is not, as has been suggested, restricted to those cases in which it has been demonstrated that a profit has been obtained. It may be the fact that in each such case a profit was made, as Kirby P pointed out in  
        Regina v Hayes  
        (1987) 29 A Crim R 452 at 463. That fact is not, however, thereby elevated to become a qualification of the statement itself. Insofar as Kirby P may be understood as suggesting to the contrary, [sic] I must respectfully disagree with him. What the statement is principally directed to is the trafficking, the dissemination of drugs to others. That is made clear by Street CJ in  
        Hayes 
        ’ case at 457. The position is worse when there has been a profitable commercial exploitation, but trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    9 Hunt J does not define “trafficking.” Applying the dictionary definition it would seem that his Honour had in mind the activity of trading or dealing in drugs. 
     
      
    10 In R v Bardo, NSWCCA, unreported, 14 July 1992, Hunt CJ at CL returned to the remarks he made in Clark and said at [1]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Regina v Peter Michael Clark  
        (15 March 1990, unreported) this Court repeated previous statements made by it that sentences involving a substantial deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate. That case was concerned with the supply by the person concerned to a number of different people over a period of time, although not upon a profitable commercial basis. The point which was made was that custodial sentences were normally required, whether or not a profit had been obtained, for ‘trafficking alone in any substantial degree.’ The word ‘trafficking’ clearly carries with it the connotation of supply on more than one occasion.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour found that in the circumstances of that case the supply of a relatively small amount of drug on one occasion did not amount to trafficking in a substantial degree. 
     
      
    12 In R v Ozer, NSWCCA, unreported, (9 November 1993), Hunt CJ at CL had occasion to again consider the concept of trafficking and its consequences when sentencing an offender. His Honour accepted the finding of the sentencing judge that the offence was “a limited and isolated event.” For this reason his Honour held that the offender was not “trafficking” in the sense in which his Honour had used that word in the cases of supply on more than one occasion. However, his Honour did not exclude the possibility that involvement in one transaction could be described as trafficking. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing principle stated in  
        Regina v Peter Michael Clark  
        and the other cases does not apply in this case. There are nevertheless obviously cases where, such is the detailed involvement of the accused in the preparation and execution of only the one commercial transaction, a full time custodial sentence is not only appropriate but also necessary.” 
        
       
      
    13 My understanding of these various statements is that where a finding can be made that an offender has engaged in repeated offences so that his or her activities can be described as trafficking, a full time custodial sentence should, unless there are exceptional circumstances, be imposed. However, if only one offence can be proved, but the circumstances surrounding that offence indicate that it was the result of a sophisticated commercial arrangement, the objective criminality involved may also require a custodial sentence, unless exceptional circumstances can otherwise be shown. 
     
      
    14 In the present case there are four grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground One: The learned sentencing judge erroneously held that the Crown had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the supply by the respondents of 51 grams of heroin on 19 December 2002 had not been an isolated instance of supply in that there had been a “supply” by them of three ounces on 14 December 2002. 
       
      
    15 The Crown argued that his Honour came to an erroneous conclusion with respect to conversations recorded by telephone interceptions which it is submitted related to drug dealing before 19 December 2002. The debate at the sentencing hearing was whether or not his Honour should find that as a result of those conversations there was evidence from which a finding of an “agreement to supply” as opposed to an “actual supply” could be made and accordingly find that more than one offence had been committed. 
     
      
    16 Perusal of the transcript of submissions on sentence reveals a detailed discussion between his Honour and counsel, both as to the evidence and, in particular, to the approach which his Honour should take to the application of the extended definition of supply. That definition is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        supply  
        includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.” 
        
       
      
    17 The discussion was directed by counsel for the Crown who invited his Honour to sentence for the admitted offence (supply of 51 grams) plus the supply of a further amount of 3 ounces. During the course of it counsel, in response to a request by his Honour as to whether or not there were any further submissions, said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well only to say your Honour would only have to be satisfied that there was an agreement to supply not that a supply actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour ultimately deals with the matter in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that for the purposes of supply it was enough to prove an agreement to supply. That may be so under the extended definition of supply in the Drugs, Misuse & Trafficking Act, but here I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the parties did in fact reach an agreement to supply. There is some evidence that they did not. There is no physical evidence of an act of supply. In all of these circumstances, I cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a supply of three ounces of heroin on 14 December 2002. Consequently I proceed on the basis that the amount supplied is 51 grams of heroin on 19 December 2002 and that there is one act of supply.” 
        
       
      
    19 Before this Court his Honour was criticised for confining the issue to whether or not there was evidence which could satisfy him that the parties did in fact reach an agreement to supply and it is submitted that his Honour should have examined the matter by considering whether or not there had been an offer to supply. Having regard to the fact that counsel for the Crown expressly invited his Honour to approach the matter by finding whether or not there was “an agreement to supply” in my opinion this Court should not entertain the criticism. The case for the Crown was framed on the basis that supply could be proved by proving an agreement but if his Honour was not satisfied of that fact, the respondent should be sentenced for the single act of supply. 
     
      
    20 I have reviewed the evidentiary material which was tendered on the sentence hearing and to my mind no criticism can be made of his Honour’s conclusion that the evidence did not enable a finding beyond reasonable doubt that an agreement to supply the 3 ounces was made. 
     
      
    21 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two: The learned sentencing judge erroneously confined to cases where there has been the supply of a prohibited drug on more than one occasion the principle that only in exceptional cases will a non-custodial sentence be appropriate for an offence of drug trafficking 
       
      
    22 The respondent Ly received a custodial sentence and accordingly ground two is relevant only to the position of the respondent Gip in so far as a non-custodial sentence was imposed. Otherwise the Crown submits that his Honour has failed to reflect in the sentence a finding which his Honour should have made that the respondents were involved in activity for which significant preparation was made and accordingly the level of criminality should have resulted in a greater sentence for the respondent Gip and a custodial sentence for the respondent Ly. 
     
      
    23 The substantial difficulty facing this submission is that faced by the first ground of appeal. No submission was made to his Honour that if a second act of supply could not be established nevertheless the admitted act should be viewed more seriously by reason of the preparatory steps which had been taken.  
     
      
    24 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three: The learned sentencing judge erred by ameliorating the sentence imposed on each Respondent because of the impact that a full-time custodial sentence would have upon the respondents’ children. 
       
      
    25 This Court has been careful to define the circumstances in which hardship to children may be relevant in ameliorating the sentence which would otherwise be imposed. The imprisonment of a breadwinner or parent will inevitably impose hardship upon other members of the family. In Regina v Liu (2005) NSWCCA 378 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The general common law rule was that hardship to third parties is not relevant to sentence, although exceptions were made. One exception was said to be when both parents were imprisoned simultaneously or the family circumstances meant that the imprisonment of one parent effectively deprived the children of parental care: see D A Thomas,  
        Principles of Sentencing, 
         2nd ed, p 212;  
        Franklin 
         (1981) 3 Crim App R (s) 65; see also  
        R v Boyle 
         (1987) 34 A Crim R 202 at 205;  
        R v Wirth 
         (1976) 14 SASR 291 and  
        R v Edwards 
         (1996) 90 A Crim R 510.” 
        
       
      
    26 In Edwards Gleeson CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, emphasised that it was only in exceptional circumstances that hardship to a third party could operate to ameliorate the sentence which should otherwise be imposed. Accordingly, if the hardship to be suffered by the spouse or children of a person sent to prison cannot fairly be characterised as exceptional in degree it should be disregarded. His Honour at 516-7 cited with approval the following passage from the judgment of Wells J in Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 at 295-296: 
     
      
       
        
        “The argument thus presented to us raises the following question: When (if ever), and to what extent (if at all), should the hardship caused, directly or indirectly, by a proposed sentence of imprisonment, to the family of, or to others closely associated with, the offender be taken into account by the court in mitigation of that sentence? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Hardship to spouse, family and friends, is the tragic, but inevitable, consequence of almost every conviction and penalty recorded in a criminal court … It seems to me that courts would often do less than their clear duty – especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration – if they allowed themselves to be much influenced by the hardship that prison sentences, which from all other points of view were justified, would be likely to cause to those near and dear to prisoners. 
        
       
       
        
        But it has been often remarked that the strength of our law lies in the willingness of judges, when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back. So it is proper that I should here add that, in my opinion, hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so … For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go.” 
        
       
      
    27 In the present case there is evidence before the sentencing judge of the family circumstances of the respondents. They were living in a de facto relationship and had two children who were then aged 3½ and 16 months. When Gip was originally detained on remand there was evidence that this resulted in significant health problems for the youngest child. Those problems were to a degree alleviated once Gip was released on bail. 
     
      
    28 Having considered the evidence the sentencing judge identified the relevant principles from the decisions in R v Wirth and R v Bednarz (2000) NSWCCA 533 and then made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think there are such highly exceptional circumstances in this case. This matter involves very young children. Both parents are facing the possibility of full-time custody. The effect of incarceration of the mother on the older child who is now three and a half is already documented and he is a child of fragile health. A further child has been born since that time and is now 16 months. I find that to be very compelling evidence and I find that it takes this case within the highly exceptional category. I think that the effect upon the offender’s young child by separation from it’s parents is far more serious and of a different nature than that which normally attends a separation from a mother by her children from imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    29 As Simpson J indicated in Bednarz there may be difficulties in defining in a particular case whether the circumstances are relevantly “highly exceptional.” Minds will differ about whether it is appropriate to classify a particular case in this manner. Although I have reservations as to whether or not the finding was appropriate I am not persuaded that the finding made by his Honour was not open. Accordingly, this Court should not interfere: see House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. 
     
      
    30 The sentencing judge also had regard to the potential hardship to the children when sentencing Ly. His Honour said that amongst other matters he took “into account also the hardship any imprisonment would mean to the children.” Having determined that the sentence imposed on Gip would be suspended it is difficult to justify a reduction in the sentence for Ly based upon hardship to the children. However, his Honour refers to the matter only incidentally and as but one of a catalogue of matters which his Honour considered justified a reduction in the sentence which might otherwise have been imposed. I am not persuaded that this finding has resulted in a sentence which was inappropriate. 
     
      
       
      Ground Four: The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate having regard to the criminality for which the respondents Gip and Ly were to be sentenced. 
       
      
    31 The Crown submitted that, even if ground one is rejected, the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the respondent Gip was of a very high order in view of the circumstances that: 
     
      
       
      a. the drug involved was heroin; 
       
      b. the quantity of 51 grams was over sixteen (16) times the traffickable quantity (3 grams) and ten (10) times the indictable quantity (5 grams); 
       
      c. the purity of the heroin was 24.5% which is high; 
       
      d. the offence involved significant planning and execution to attempt to avoid detection. 
       
      
    32 In particular, the Crown complained that having regard to the objective matters, notwithstanding the subjective circumstances of the respondent, Gip, a custodial sentence should have been imposed. 
     
      
    33 In relation to Ly, the Crown emphasised that, apart from the objective seriousness of the particular offence, Ly was on a three-year bond at the time of that offence. That bond had been imposed in March 2001 for an offence of driving whilst disqualified. An earlier two-year bond for a similar offence had expired on August 2002, which was only 4 months before the commission of the present offence. 
     
      
    34 I am not persuaded that the sentence which his Honour imposed in relation to either respondent was inadequate. I have already determined that his Honour’s decision to suspend the sentence in respect of Gip was relevantly within his Honour’s discretion. In relation to both offenders the statistics provided to the Court from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales confirm that the term of both the non-parole period and the head sentences were within the appropriate range for the circumstances of this offence as determined by his Honour.  
     
      
       
      One further matter 
       
      
    35 There is one further significant matter. The sentences were imposed on 30 August and almost two months elapsed before the Crown lodged the appeal. In R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 the delay involved was two months between sentence and the lodging of the Crown appeal. At [54] the Court said of that delay: 
     
      
       
        
        “A delay of that order is generally unacceptable, particularly where an offender has a period of 12 months or less to serve … and especially where he or she is serving a first gaol sentence. No good reason was given for the delay and it is a weighty matter in deciding whether to intervene.” 
        
       
      
    36 In my opinion those remarks are apposite to the circumstances of each of the present respondents. This is as much the case in relation to the respondent Gip who has received the benefit of a non-custodial sentence as it is in the present case in relation to the respondent Ly. 
     
      
    37 I would dismiss both appeals. 
     
      
    38 ROTHMAN J: I join in the order proposed by his Honour McClellan CJ at CL. I would add the following comments in relation to the issue associated with the sentence to be imposed on “drug traffickers”.  
     
      
    39 This Court, in R v Clark, expressed a view reflecting the then and current community view on the importance of general deterrence on drug traffickers; it is only in exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be appropriate.  
     
      
    40 In R v Bardo, supra, Hunt CJ at CL states that the term “trafficking”, when used in the principles adumbrated in R v Clark, carried with it the connotation of supply on more than one occasion.  
     
      
    41 The statement of principle by this Court in R v Clark (or likewise, the explanation in R v Bardo) is not a legislative enactment. It ought not be the subject of analysis in the same way as a statute. As the passage cited by McClellan CJ at CL from R v Clark makes clear, it is the involvement in general supply of drugs to others that is the concern of the principle which favours custodial sentences. As such, the term “drug trafficking” or “trafficking” ought not be given rigid definitions, or subjected to the same scrutiny to which we subject “supply” and “deemed supply” in the Act. Nor should the Court constrain itself by an overly technical approach to a sentence to be imposed.  
     
      
    42 As I made clear in R v Livas [2006] NSWCCA 54 at [14], there seems to be no good reason why the mere fact that there is only one offence that has been charged or proven ought to prevent the Court from coming to the view that the offender has been involved or is involved in trafficking. The Crown and the defence, in this case, have concentrated on the detail of the principles in Clark and Bardo without regard to the general principles of which they form part. 
     
      
    43 The ultimate question is whether the accused is involved, in the ordinary sense, in trafficking. The mere fact that a person has been caught on only one occasion does not mean the person is not involved in trafficking. The question for the sentencing judge is whether there are facts, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, which facts give rise to an exercise of discretion consistent with the approach in Clark. Those facts may be an agreement to supply on another occasion, an attempt to supply on another occasion, participation in a process which envisages supply on more than one occasion, participation in a syndicate, or a number of other circumstances.  
     
      
    44 The ultimate question must be whether, on the application of ordinary principles of sentencing, full-time custody is warranted. In any situation where the person has been shown to have been involved (directly or indirectly) in an ongoing arrangement, or intended ongoing arrangement, for the supply of drugs, that person, for the purpose of the sentencing principle, should be taken to have been involved in trafficking. The isolated, one off incident of supply, of which Bardo and Livas are examples, does not include persons who, although charged with one offence, are otherwise shown to have an involvement in a process which contemplates supply on more than one occasion. That could be shown, as already stated, by proving any one of a range of activities which give rise to the inference of past, present or future involvement in trafficking. 
     
      
    45 Having made that comment, the manner in which these issues were addressed by Counsel before the sentencing judge would make it wholly unjust to deal with the issues afresh on appeal. 46 SMART AJ: The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on Sung Ly and his de facto wife, Shayla Ngoc Trang Gip. Each pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, heroin, between 9 October 2002 and 20 December 2002. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 15 months to date from 2 May 2005 and she was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months. In her case there was an order suspending the execution of the sentence for 2 years and directing that she be released from custody on condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years. 
     
      
    47 There was no dispute that the charge covered the supply of 51 grams of heroin on 19 December 2002 by the offenders. The Crown contended both at the sentence hearing and on appeal, that this supply was not an isolated instance but had occurred in the course of one or more other similar dealings and sought to prove that beyond reasonable doubt. From the transcript of the sentence hearing there are two views as to the Crown’s approach to this issue at that hearing. 
     
      
    48 The view taken by the Crown on this appeal was that the Crown at the sentence hearing narrowed the issue to whether the sentencing judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 14 December 2002 there had been a supply within the extended definition of supply in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. There was a major dispute at the sentence hearing whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a supply of 3 grams of heroin on 14 December 2002. 
     
      
    49 There is an alternative view that, while the Crown contended at the sentence hearing that on 14 December 2002 there had been an instance of the supply of heroin, it relied on the whole of the intercepted material and the surveillance material to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the supply of heroin on 19 December was not an isolated instance. On this approach the failure to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a supply of 3 grams of heroin on 14 December 2002 was not fatal to its contention that the supply on 19 December 2002 was not an isolated instance. After reviewing the whole of the sentence proceedings I prefer this alternative approach to the Crown’s stance at the sentence hearing. Ultimately, it will be necessary to return to the approach taken by the Crown in this Court. I propose first to review the sentence hearing. At the start of that hearing on 19 August 2005 (p3) the judge was told by the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “What the Crown alleges is that the offenders were involved in the business of supplying drugs and that their involvement preceded 19 December 2002 when they were arrested and the Crown relies on the evidence of the telephone intercepts and of the surveillance that was conducted.” 
         
        
       
      
    50 The Crown Prosecutor (T4) stated that the intercepted material (telephone calls) and the surveillance material would allow the Court to infer that there was a prior occasion on 14 December 2002 concerning the supply of 3 ounces of heroin involving the offenders.  
     
      
    51 The Prosecutor stated (T5): 
     
      
       
        
        ”I rely on the extended definition it could be an agreement to supply or an offer to supply.” 
        
       
      
    52 The riposte of counsel for Ms Gip was (T5): 
     
      
       
        
        “… even on that basis there’s insufficient evidence in relation to an offer of supply or an agreement.” 
        
       
      
    53 The telephone intercepts reveal an ongoing relationship between the offenders and Raymond Russell and Jason George Deron from at least October 2002. There are many telephone calls between the offenders and Mr Russell. Messrs Russell and Deron came from the Newcastle District, including areas to the south of that District. They frequently arranged to meet, and met the offenders, about 8.30pm at a place on the Central Coast. The offenders travelled from Cabramatta. The surveillance material records a meeting on 10 October 2002 between Mr Russell and people in the offenders’ Honda sedan. An item is seen to pass hands. The Honda, and the vehicle in which Mr Russell was travelling, depart. 
     
      
    54 There are also telephone calls between the offenders and a male called Khanh, in which they employ a code, for example “Get two bottles of wines” (22 November 2002 at 0203 hours) - that is two ounces of heroin. The telephone intercepts reveal that the offenders obtained their supplies from a male called Khanh. For example, on 8 December 2002 at 1313 hours Mr Ly telephoned and asked Khanh for 25 dong (a name used for heroin). Khanh indicated that he did not have that quantity and enquired whether 10 would be all right. Mr Ly stated that that would not be enough. There was then some discussion about “get the ‘whatsie’ to pay them”. 
     
      
    55 On 8 December 2002 at 1748 hours Mr Ly telephoned Raymond Russell and advised that he (Ly) was going up that night. Mr Russell preferred the following night, but Mr Ly said “some customers they call me tonight.” They agreed to meet at about 8.30pm that night. Mr Russell told Mr Ly, “Bring two up”. Mr Ly agreed. 
     
      
    56 On 10 December 2002 at 1605 hours, in a telephone call, Messrs Ly and Russell agreed to meet about 8.30pm about “some biz”. 
     
      
    57 On 14 December 2002 at 1116 hours Mr Russell telephoned Mr Ly and said, “Don’t forget to find out about the good stuff for us. You know what I said last night.” Mr Ly commented that he had not seen “the boss yet”. They arranged to meet at 8.30pm that day. At 1825 hours Mr Ly telephoned Mr Russell and postponed their meeting until around 9pm. Less than a minute later Mr Ly telephoned Khanh. Mr Ly asked for three bottles (three ounces of heroin) and Khanh agreed. At 1946 hours Mr Ly telephoned Khanh and advised, “I’ll be there in about fifteen minutes.” At 2006 hours Mr Ly telephoned Khanh and gave him directions as to how to get to their meeting point. At 2008 hours Khanh telephoned Mr Ly and sought and received a further direction to their meeting place. At 2054 and 2057 hours there were conversations involving Mr Russell, Mr Ly and Ms Gip as to meeting shortly. At 2145 hours Mr Ly telephoned Mr Russell and stated, “Yeah, I can’t because … I can’t …that … that price’s too dear. I can’t reach it. I can’t get it you know.” Mr Russell asked, “Too dear?” Mr Ly replied, “Yeah … because the yellow one, you know …”. At 2147 hours Mr Russell telephoned Mr Ly. Mr Ly could not say how much he would pay until he had “them” tested. There was some discussion about price and Mr Ly wanted “them” to come down in price and someone to have a look at what was being offered. Mr Russell left it on the basis that Mr Ly would see what they (the suppliers) wanted to do. 
     
      
    58 From the conversations it seems that Mr Ly’s suppliers had access to better quality products (drugs) and that Mr Russell wanted some of these. Mr Ly was not prepared to pay the price being asked for these. He may have had to buy greater quantities than Mr Russell wanted.  
     
      
    59 It was common ground that at the meeting on 14 December 2002 between Messrs Ly and Russell the police did not see anything being handed over nor could they see what was handed over at any other meeting. 
     
      
    60 There was mention of samples (see transcript of 30.11.02 at 1223 hours). 
     
      
    61 A study of the intercepts leads to the conclusion that there was an ongoing business relationship between the offenders and Messrs Russell and Deron and between the offenders and Khanh, involving the supply of drugs. There were discussions, negotiations and transactions involving the supply of heroin. However this may be, it is necessary to return to the way in which the case was argued by the Crown before the sentencing judge and this Court. 
     
      
    62 In her closing submissions (T35-T36) to the sentencing judge the prosecutor pointed out that the quantity of heroin involved was not a small amount, at least 51 grams of heroin. She added that even if the Court found that only 51 grams were supplied it was not an isolated incident and that the Court had evidence that clearly placed the offenders’ criminality in its proper context. She added that there had been an association between the offenders and others of a criminal nature that commenced way before 19 December 2002. 
     
      
    63 After the legal representatives for the offenders had made their submissions the sentencing judge invited the Crown to make any further submissions. The prosecutor submitted that the judge would only have to be satisfied that there was an agreement to supply, not that a supply actually occurred. The prosecutor did not further develop her submission that there was an offer to supply. It is a moot point whether the phrase “offer to supply” requires a price to be fixed. Does “offer to supply” include a case where a party offers to supply the drug but no price is fixed? What is the position if the price is to be agreed, but is never agreed? There is also the case where the price is stated in the offer, but the price is rejected. These points were not argued and their determination must await another day. 
     
      
    64 Returning to the events of 14 December 2002 in the circumstances briefly summarised, it was well open to the judge not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that 3 grams of heroin was supplied on or about 14 December 2002. There were discussions and negotiations, but it was not clear whether they went any further. 
     
      
    65 Having regard to the way in which the matter was argued before this Court by the Crown, the last mentioned conclusion meant that the Crown could not rely on more than the events of 19 December 2002. While the Crown’s case was argued with much skill and industry, I have reservations as to the correctness of its approach and its assessment of how the case was argued before the sentencing judge. The Crown’s views on these matters were open and so my reservations must be put aside. Counsel for the offenders was not required to deal with the matter on the broader basis to which I have referred. 
     
      
    66 To establish that the offence was not an isolated instance the Crown does not have to be able to prove another specific instance beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was not an isolated one may be inferred from conduct or statements by the accused. It may be apparent that a business is being run or that there is a course of conduct. I would not limit the ways or manner in which proofs of the required standard may be adduced. 
     
      
    67 Ms Gip had a compelling subjective case. If both she and her husband went to prison there would be the difficulty of caring for their two young children, one of whom was sickly. 
     
      
    68 The judge rightly concluded that there were highly exceptional circumstances which justified the Court in taking into account the hardship which would be occasioned to two young children. If both parents were imprisoned the available relative to assist with the care of the children was a 78 year old aunt who also had to work. During the period (20 December 2002 – 19 February 2003) when Ms Gip was in pre-sentence custody, her elder child, who was born on 19 October 2001, was adversely affected to a marked degree. He refused to eat and play and stopped developing. On 27 December 2002 he contracted a febrile illness. He continued to have fevers. He had a history of asthma. He was underweight. Both eardrums were inflamed. He had regressed considerably since being separated from his mother. After being reunited with his mother in February 2003 he improved considerably and was making progress again with his development. 
     
      
    69 At the date of sentencing there was a second child, aged 16 months. Ms Gip suffered from psychiatric illnesses of some severity. It is not necessary to summarise these. 
     
      
    70 The sentencing judge correctly determined the sentence which should be imposed on Ms Gip and correctly suspended the sentence. This Court should not in any event, in the exercise of its discretion, intervene. 
     
      
    71 As to both offenders there was a delay of 2 years 8 months between their arrest and coming before the judge on 19 August 2005 for sentence. This does not appear to be their fault, although Ms Gip’s pregnancy probably delayed the hearing. As to Mr Ly, the notice of appeal was not served until 26 October 2005. Mr Ly has already served over two-thirds of the non-parole period of 15 months. He is due to be released on parole on 1 August 2006. It would not be fair to extend his period in prison at this late stage. 
     
      
    72 As to Ms Gip, the notice of appeal was not served until 1 November 2005. She was in pre-sentence custody for 2 months. For an offence which occurred on 19 December 2002, being the day of her arrest and bearing in mind that she was released from prison on bail on 19 February 2003, it would not be right after so long a delay to send her to prison when she has to care for two young children, one of whom is sickly. 
     
      
    73 The Crown appeals should be dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA:  The applicant was convicted of a charge of importing into Australia a prohibited substance, namely, cocaine being not less than the trafficable quantity, contrary to the provisions of s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The quantity of drug imported was 215.6g (253.1g gross), having a street value of $246,000.00. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine not exceeding $500,000.00 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years, or both. 
     
      
    2 The applicant, who was arrested on 14 November 2003, shortly after his arrival in Australia, pleaded guilty to the charge. He was sentenced on 16 September 2004 by Graham DCJ to imprisonment for a period of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months, the sentence commencing from the date he was taken into custody, namely on the day of his arrest (14 November 2003).  
     
      
       
      Sentences imposed 
       
      
    3 The applicant was one of a group of five offenders who brought cocaine into the country on that day. The co-offenders were all foreign nationals. Although the sentencing judge considered that there was a measure of organisation and co-ordination amongst the five offenders, his Honour proceeded upon the basis that the individual offenders were charged, and were to be sentenced, on the basis of their respective participation in the drug importation, with the offence being confined to the precise quantity that each offender brought in individually.  
     
      
    4 Graham DCJ sentenced PP on 28 May 2004. The other four offenders were sentenced on 16 September 2004 at the same time as the applicant.  
     
      
    5 PP was sentenced to a period of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. PP was granted leave to appeal from the severity of that sentence. The appeal was allowed and the sentence quashed. In lieu, PP was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 7 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months, expiring on 13 March 2007. 
     
      
    6 Jules and Jacob were sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months. These sentences were the same as that imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    7 Keram was likewise sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years, but with a lower non-parole period of 4 years. The reason for the disparity in the non-parole period specified for Keram was because of his accepted ill health. 
     
      
       
      Factual overview 
       
      
    8 The evidence before Graham DCJ established that the applicant flew from Sydney to Bali on 9 November 2003. From there he flew to Singapore, for the specific purpose of engaging in this offence. Between 10 and 13 November 2003 the applicant swallowed 50 pellets of cocaine. The other offenders similarly swallowed or otherwise internally concealed different quantities of cocaine at about the same time. 
     
      
    9 The five offenders travelled to Australia on the same flight. The applicant’s luggage was chosen for baggage examination. That examination revealed that the baggage bore an identification tag in the name of Jules. The applicant’s airline ticket was subsequently located in Jules' wallet. 
     
      
    10 Although an examination of the applicant’s luggage produced no result, traces of cocaine were found in his suitcase and wallet. The applicant told Customs officers that this may have been deposited in his suitcase prior to it being packed. A frisk search of the applicant revealed nothing. The applicant consented to an internal search but denied that he was concealing any drugs. However a scan taken at St George Hospital revealed the presence of foreign objects in his digestive tract. Over the following day the applicant passed 50 oblong shaped pellets. These were subsequently analysed as containing cocaine. 
     
      
    11 The applicant formally entered a plea of guilty on 10 September 2004, approximately a week before he was sentenced. However, he had made it clear at least from 5 March 2004, when the matter first came before the District Court, of his intention to plead guilty and the matter proceeded through the Court on the basis that it was a sentence matter. The trial judge therefore treated the plea as if it had been entered on 5 March 2004, which “in practical terms, only slightly delayed the process of acknowledging … guilt”.  
     
      
    12 Each of the co-offenders also pleaded guilty and had done so at an earlier stage than did the applicant. In each case the pleas had been entered in the Local Court once the Crown brief of evidence was furnished and the precise nature and purity of the cocaine was ascertained. However, his Honour considered in practical terms that there was little difference in the utilitarian value of the pleas of the co-offenders and that of the applicant. 
     
      
    13 The trial judge sentenced each of the offenders on the basis that each was a courier and that each had been induced to take part in the enterprise by personal circumstances that tended to mitigate his involvement. The detail of those circumstances was fully explored by the sentencing judge in his Remarks on Sentence. In short, each had financial pressures of varying degrees. In the case of the applicant, he was in a considerable amount of debt due to the failure of the surf tour businesses that he owned and operated. The business failure was caused in large measure by the downturn in the tourist industry following the terrorist attack in America on 11 September 2001, and then again by the Bali bombing in 2002. 14 His Honour treated the applicant’s involvement in the importation as being at the level of a ""mere courier"", but nonetheless considered that there was ""a measure of planning and deliberation about [the applicant’s offence] which [was] not a feature of all of the offenders”. This finding was based upon the fact that the applicant had travelled to Singapore for the express purpose of engaging in this offence and had travelled there on a prior occasion for the same purpose but in circumstances where that planned offence was not carried through.  
     
      
    15 In the case of Jules and Keram, Graham DCJ found that they did not become involved in the offence until they were in Singapore, each having gone there for an independent and legitimate purpose. His Honour found that Jacob's trip to Singapore had involved both a legitimate purpose as well as an intention to engage in a drug smuggling offence. In the case of PP, his Honour made a finding that he had travelled to Singapore for the express purpose of engaging in the drug importation. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    16 The applicant contends that Graham DCJ’s sentencing discretion miscarried in the following respects: 
     
      
       
      1. His Honour erred in finding that the applicant’s criminality was equal to or greater than that of the four co-offenders. 
       
       
      2. His Honour erred in failing to have sufficient regard to the applicant's subjective circumstances, in particular, his previous good character, his insignificant criminal record, and the extraordinary circumstances leading the applicant to committing the offence. 
       
       
      3. His Honour erred by giving excessive consideration to the timing of the pleas of guilty of the other co-offenders and the measure of cooperation extended by the co-offenders prior to their pleas of guilty. 
       
       
      4. His Honour erred in calculating the sentence for the applicant to be the same as the co-offenders, Jules and Jacob, and more than that of the co-offenders PP and Keram. 
       
       
      5. His Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried because the applicant was left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the severity of his sentence compared to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. 
       
      
    17 It is convenient to deal first with Ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: parity 
       
      
    18 The applicant alleges that he was left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the severity of his sentence compared with the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. Those principles were discussed in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, especially at 301 where Dawson and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. … However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
        , recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’"". 
        
       
      
    19 In this case, the question of parity has to be considered both in relation to the sentence imposed on Jules, Jacob and Keram on the one hand and PP on the other. One of the significant differences between the applicant and the other offenders was the quantity of drug imported. This is demonstrated in the following table: 
     
      
       
      Keram 100 pellets 518.5g gross 385.7g pure purity 74.4% 
       
       Jules 100 pellets 520.1g gross 396.3g pure purity 76.2% 
       
       Jacob 73 pellets 386.1g gross 331.3g pure purity 85% 
       
        
      King 50 pellets 253.1g gross 215.6 pure purity 85.2% 
       
        
        PP 35 pellets 175.2g gross 140.3 pure purity 80.1% 
        
       
      
    20 Before dealing with the question of parity therefore, it is necessary to have a fuller understanding of the role that the weight of the drugs has in the sentencing of an offender charged with an offence relating to narcotic drugs; in this case, with the importation of such drugs. 
     
      
    21 Graham DCJ dealt with the significance that the quantity of drug imported should have in the sentencing process in his Remarks on Sentence at p.25: 
     
      
       
        
        “In considering the quantity of the drug involved, counsel have submitted, as part of an argument for parity with the offender [PP], that the weight of the narcotics imported ought not be regarded as a chief factor in sentencing for this kind of offence. The Crown accepts that is a correct legal proposition, but points to the qualification, that is that it is, nevertheless, a matter which can have significance. As was said by the High Court in Wong … in general, however, the larger the importation, the higher the offender’s level of participation, the greater the offender’s knowledge, the greater the reward the offender hoped to receive, the heavier the punishment that would be exacted. 
        
       
       
        
        Significantly, in relation to the present case, and insofar as the guidelines which were struck down by the High Court in  
        Wong 
         have retained some continuing relevance (eg, as indicative of a range or pattern of sentencing), the case of [PP] fell within the lower range outlined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Wong 
        , while the offenders here all fall within the next step or category of ranges identified in those previous guidelines. On the other hand, the quantities range between 140 and almost 400 grams, but each represents, as has been pointed out in the submissions, all that could be ingested or otherwise secreted in the person by each of the offenders. In that sense they each brought in as much as they could bring in. Nevertheless, some significance might properly attach to the difference in weight but, in the end, it seems that it would make very little practical difference to the sentence ultimately imposed in each case.” 
        
       
      
    22 The portion of his Honour's Remarks on Sentence emphasised above was drawn from the joint judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) in Wong v The Queen (2002) 207 CLR 584 at [64]. Later, at [67], their Honours dealt with the significance that the weight of narcotic had in the sentencing process. Their Honours first referred to the importance that had been attached to the weight of the narcotic by Parliament distinguishing between the maximum sentence that may be imposed for offences involving trafficable quantities compared with commercial quantities. Their Honours then considered the question whether weight was generally the chief factor to be taken into account in the sentencing process. This question was relevant as the Court of Criminal Appeal had treated weight as the chief factor to be taken into account in Wong. Their Honours consideration of this question was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “68. It must be recognised that not all offenders will know or even suspect how much pure narcotic is to be imported. Apart from the extent to which the pure narcotic is diluted or cut (a matter about which those involved in the importation may know little or nothing), it is by no means uncommon for many of those involved in an importation of narcotics to know nothing at all about what they are dealing with, except that it is a quantity of narcotic. 
         
         
        69. It follows that there will be many cases in which a sentencing judge will be more concerned to identify the level of the offender's criminality by looking to the state of the offender's knowledge about the importation in which he or she was involved. Often enough, information about the kind and size of reward given or promised to the offender for involvement in the importation will be seen as important in fixing a sentence and distinguishing between offenders.” 
        
       
      
    23 In this case, Graham DCJ did not place much importance on the quantity of drug imported. Rather he considered that the overall criminality of each was reflected in the fact that the individual offenders had imported as much of the drug as could be ingested or secreted in the person. When that was taken into account, together with the individual circumstances to which his Honour had regard in relation to each offender, his Honour considered that the difference in weight of the drug brought in by each was not of sufficient significance as to make any difference to the ultimate sentence imposed.  
     
      
    24 It is this process of reasoning by his Honour that leads me to the view that the relevance that the weight of the drug imported ought to have had in the sentencing process has to be viewed having regard to the principles of parity. That involves a consideration of the facts and circumstances that his Honour took into account in relation to each offender. In this regard, it is necessary to consider the factors relevant to the offenders Jules, Jacob and Keram on the one hand and PP on the other, as compared to the factors relevant to the applicant. These considerations will necessarily overlap with the matters raised in the other grounds of appeal and which I deal with below. 
     
      
       
      Parity in relation to Jules, Jacob and Keram 
       
      
    25 It will be remembered that Jules, Jacob and Keram all pleaded guilty in the Local Court after the Crown's brief of evidence had been delivered. The applicant did not plead guilty until shortly prior to the sentence hearing. However, his Honour accepted that the applicant had indicated his intention to plead guilty from the time that the matter was before the District Court and that there was little practical difference between the time that the applicant pleaded guilty and the time that the other offenders did so. 
     
      
    26 His Honour sentenced each on the basis that he was a courier. His Honour found however that there were some differences in the circumstances in which each had entered upon the criminal enterprise. He accepted that in the case of Jules, the approach to carry the drugs had only occurred in Singapore. Jules was otherwise there for the legitimate purpose of renewing his Indonesian visa. Jacob, for his part, had initially been approached in Indonesia but had only decided to take up the offer of taking drugs to Australia shortly before he went to Singapore, also for the purpose of renewing his visa. His Honour found, in relation to Keram, that there was little credible explanation as to his level of involvement, including the precise circumstances in which he agreed to participate in the importation. His Honour considered however that there was a likelihood of some prior planning. By contrast, his Honour found that there was a measure of planning and deliberation in the case of the applicant (see Remarks on Sentence p.90) for the reasons discussed at [14] above. Although the applicant challenges his Honour's findings in these respects, they were findings open to him on the evidence and in my opinion, were the only findings the Court could have made. 
     
      
    27 His Honour found that the personal circumstances of each of the four offenders with whom he dealt on 16 September 2004 were such that each was vulnerable to an offer of payment should they carry out the importation. Each was in difficult financial circumstances for a variety of reasons, and each was emotionally fragile, again for a variety of reasons, at the time. Again, in my opinion, it was open to his Honour to consider that the circumstances of each was roughly similar, notwithstanding the personal differences giving rise to the vulnerability of each. 
     
      
    28 His Honour considered that the prospects of re-offending in the case of each of the accused was minimal, and, it followed, that the prospects of rehabilitation were good. 
     
      
    29 His Honour was also satisfied on the evidence, and on this there could be no doubt, that each of the accused was aware that he was to bring into Australia a quantity of cocaine. It appears that each was to receive about the same payment per pellet for the importation. 
     
      
    30 None of the four offenders dealt with on 16 September 2004 had any relevant prior criminal history.  
     
      
    31 Each of the four offenders consented to the internal searches that led to the discovery of the drugs. This was so even though each had denied that he was carrying any drugs at the time. Once the drugs were detected, Jules, Jacob and Keram made statements to the police. The information they provided to the police varied one from the other, and later during the course of the court proceedings, including the sentencing hearing, they each had different versions again, as to what had happened. The differences are spelt out in his Honour's Remarks on Sentence. His Honour considered that by the time each had come to give evidence, they were endeavouring to minimise their own role and the roles of each other in the organisation of the importation.  
     
      
    32 His Honour found that Jules had given some limited co-operation to the authorities, as evidenced by his consent to being searched and that he also admitted his guilt. His Honour noted however that the assistance was limited by the different information given to the police as compared to that given earlier in the investigation. Likewise, his Honour found that Jacob had given some assistance to the police, including making admissions, in addition to consenting to being searched.  
     
      
    33 As I have already mentioned, his Honour was particularly dissatisfied with the evidence given by Keram. Apart from Keram’s consent to being searched, his Honour found the different stories that he gave to the police, the probation officer and in Court were such that he was an unsatisfactory witness. It can be inferred from this that his Honour gave little weight to any assistance to the authorities.  
     
      
    34 The applicant however had not made any statements to the police and accordingly, apart from consenting to being searched, had not provided assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    35 It will be apparent from the above that leaving aside the quantity of drugs imported, there was relatively little in the objective and subjective circumstances relating to each of the offenders that required any differentiation between them so far as sentencing was concerned. That being so, the question directly arises as to whether the different weight of narcotic that each brought in should play any role in the sentence that ought to have been imposed on each. 
     
      
    36 His Honour approached the matter in the way I have already outlined, namely, on the basis that each had brought in as much as he could secrete in his body. In the case of Jules, Jacob and Keram, the evidence was that each was given a quantity of 100 pellets. Jacob only managed to swallow 73. The applicant brought in 50 pellets. 
     
      
    37 That finding, that each had brought in as much as he could secrete in his body, is not correct in relation to the applicant. The only evidence in relation to his importation was that he brought in a quantity of 50 pellets. There was no evidence that he was supposed to, or could have, imported or was asked to import 100 pellets. In those circumstances, I am of the opinion that the weight of the drug imported by the applicant was a relevant consideration and should have been dealt with as such by his Honour. It follows on that reasoning that it was not, in the circumstances, sufficient for his Honour to conclude that although some significance might properly be attached to the difference in quantity, in the end that factor would make little practical difference to the sentence ultimately posed.  
     
      
    38 The only significant difference between the applicant and the co-offenders Jules, Jacob and Keram was his Honour's finding about the increased measure of planning and organisation on the applicant’s part. That was a finding that differentiated the applicant from Jules. However, his Honour made a finding of some prior knowledge on the part of Jacob in terms that were not significantly different from the applicant's position. Perhaps it might be said that Jacob’s decision to participate in the importation was more spontaneous, being made shortly prior to travelling. Nonetheless, Jacob went to Singapore with a purpose of participating in the drug importation. It is not known when the applicant first agreed to participate in this particular importation. But whenever it was, he and Jacob had an opportunity to either resist becoming involved or to pull out prior to travelling to Singapore. Neither did so. No finding was made as to the degree of planning that was involved on the part of Keram, although it is clear that his Honour also considered that his agreement was not opportunistically obtained in the same way as was the case with Jules.  
     
      
    39 Given those differences, I am not satisfied that the degree of planning that his Honour found in the applicant's case balanced out the quantity of drug imported, which in his case was 50% less than was the case of Keram and Jules and almost 25% less than was the case with Jacob. In my opinion, that objective circumstance required some different treatment. There are a number of reasons for this. There is greater criminality involved in bringing a larger quantity into the country. This was recognised in general terms by the High Court in Wong in the statement quoted by his Honour. The amount of harm potentially done to the Australian community is greater the greater the quantity of drug involved. The reward to the individual for agreeing to engage in the criminal behaviour is usually dependent upon the quantity of drug. That in turn is relevant both to personal and general deterrence. 
     
      
    40 It follows in my opinion that his Honour erred in failing to differentiate between the offenders in relation to quantity and in failing to do so, the applicant has a proper sense of grievance in the sense discussed in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione. It follows that there should be some variation in the sentence imposed upon the applicant so as to reflect the difference in criminality involved. Before deciding what variation ought be made, it is necessary to consider whether there is any sense of grievance that flowed having regard to the sentence imposed on PP. 
     
      
       
      Parity in relation to PP 
       
      
    41 PP was sentenced by Graham DCJ on 28 May 2004. PP appealed (R v PP [2005] NSWCCA 214). On 14 June 2005, the Court of Criminal Appeal varied the sentence imposed by Graham DCJ and sentenced him in lieu to imprisonment for 5 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months. The sentence commenced on the date of arrest, namely 14 November 2003. The non-parole period expired on 13 March 2007. 
     
      
    42 The Court of Criminal Appeal found that Graham DCJ erred in a number of respects in the sentence imposed on PP as compared to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders. In the first place his Honour allowed a discount of 20% for the pleas of guilty entered by Jules, Jacob, Keram and the applicant. However, he only allowed a discount of 15% for PP's plea of guilty, notwithstanding that it had been entered at the same time as the pleas by Jules, Jacob and Keram. There was no explanation given by his Honour as to why a different discount had been applied and the Court of Criminal Appeal found that there was no basis for doing so. 
     
      
    43 Next, Graham DCJ, in sentencing the co-offenders rounded down the sentence after giving a discount of 20% from 7 years 2 months to 7 years. As the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out (at [34]), this immediately gave the co-offenders the benefit of an additional 2 months reduction. No rounding down was effected in the sentence imposed on PP after the reduction of 15% for the plea of guilty. The Court of Criminal Appeal found no basis for that difference in approach. 
     
      
    44 The Court of Criminal Appeal next found that there was no basis for differentiating between PP and his co-offenders in relation to fixing the non-parole period. In the case of PP, Graham DCJ had affixed the non-parole period at 66% of the total sentence. However, the period fixed for the non-parole period of the sentences imposed on Jules, Jacob and the applicant was 60% for the non-parole period and 40% for the parole period. 
     
      
    45 Finally, PP had provided assistance to the authorities in a way that was far more significant than was the assistance provided by the other four co-offenders. In PP's case, Graham DCJ had considered that PP's assistance ought to be reflected in a reduction in his sentence of 20%. He made no deduction in the sentence of the Jules, Jacob, Keram and the applicant. Notwithstanding, the actual result in sentencing was that PP’s non-parole period imposed by Graham DCJ was only 4 months less than that imposed in respect of Jules, Jacob and the applicant and was the same as that imposed in the case of Keram. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered (at [37]), that there was ""a real public interest ... in correcting this error"". 
     
      
    46 There are thus two significant differences between the considerations relevant to PP and to the applicant. The first is the assistance given to the police by PP. The second relates to the quantity of drug imported. Nothing more needs to be said in relation to the assistance given to the police. That differentiates PP's case significantly from that of the applicant and any question of parity between PP and the applicant will need to take that into consideration. There is a question however whether the quantity of drugs imported by PP should also be a point of differentiation. 
     
      
    47 PP brought in a quantity of pellets approximately 30% less (or a pure quantity of approximately 35% less) than did the applicant. The Court of Criminal Appeal accepted that there was some merit in the sentencing judge's view that the lesser quantity did not indicate a lower level of moral culpability, given that it was intended that he should also bring in 100 pellets. The Court concluded however that the quantity of the drug was a relevant consideration. This Court, when considering questions of parity as between the applicant and PP should therefore also give significance to the difference in quantity. 
     
      
    48 It follows, that the applicant can have no sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on PP.  
     
      
    49 Notwithstanding this conclusion, it follows from what I have said in relation to the co-offenders Jules, Jacob and Keram that this ground of appeal has been made out so that the applicant will need to be re-sentenced by this Court. In this regard PP’s sentence remains relevant in determining what sentence ought to be imposed upon the applicant, PP being entitled to be sentenced to a lesser period of imprisonment than the applicant.  
     
      
    50 The remaining grounds of appeal can, therefore, be considered briefly. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
      
    51 In my opinion, the applicant has failed to establish that his Honour erred in his findings relating to the specific subjective circumstances of each of the offenders, or in the manner in which he dealt with their degree of prior involvement in the planned importation prior to arrival in Singapore. There were differences between the various co-offenders in these respects. However, the differences were not of such a nature as to require any different overall treatment by the trial judge. 
     
      
    52 To the extent that there may have been any slight differences in either the subjective or objective circumstances of the offenders the sentencing judge was entitled, within the exercise of his discretion, to find that the appropriate sentence in each case should be the same. In other words, it was within his Honour’s sentencing discretion to assess the overall criminality of the co-offenders together with the respective subjective matters of each, as warranting the same sentence of imprisonment. Likewise, it was within his Honour’s sentencing discretion to determine that there should be some differentiation in the non-parole period specified for Keram having regard to his ill health. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    53 Nor was there any error in the manner in which the trial judge dealt with the timing of the pleas of guilty. The other co-offenders all pleaded guilty at a time earlier than the applicant. Nonetheless, the trial judge treated the applicant's plea as having been made in a timely manner and as having the same utilitarian value as the pleas of Jules, Jacob and Keram. This complaint is totally misconceived.  
     
      
       
      Re sentence 
       
      
    54 I have already expressed the view that the difference in the circumstances of the applicant in bringing in a lesser quantity of drug than Jules, Jacob and Keram should reflect itself in a lesser sentence. Having regard to the differentiation that thereby needs to be made and having regard to the sentence that was imposed on PP, I am of the opinion that the sentence that ought to be imposed is a sentence of 6 years and 6 months commencing on 14 November 2003, with a non-parole period of 4 years expiring on 13 November 2007. 
     
      
    55 Accordingly I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal granted.  
       
      2. Appeal allowed.  
       
      3. Sentence imposed by Graham DCJ quashed; and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 6 years and 6 months commencing 14 November 2003, with a non-parole period of 4 years expiring on 13 November 2007.

    57 HOWIE J: I agree with Beazley JA.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Gil Bum Yun, is to be sentenced today for the murder of Sun Chun Zhe, following his conviction for that crime by a jury on 20 October 2005. That conviction followed a trial which had commenced on 26 September 2005. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty prescribed by the Crimes Act 1900 for the crime of murder is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 Under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the standard non-parole period of twenty years for murder is stipulated. I shall return to the provisions of that Act later in these remarks. 
     
      
    4 First, it is my task to find the objective facts relating to the subject crime. In so doing, I have applied the criminal standard of proof, namely, proof beyond reasonable doubt. The findings of fact which I make must not be inconsistent with the verdict returned by the jury. 
     
      
    5 I find the facts as follows:- 
     
      
    6 Approximately a month prior to the evening of 30 April 2003 and 1 May of that year the deceased and his wife, Laner Jin, had moved into a flat at 2/14 Beaumont Street, Campsie. At the time they moved into that flat, the prisoner and his mother, Choi Myung Ja, were already residing there. At all material times thereafter the four remained in residence at those premises.  
     
      
    7 On 30 April 2003 the prisoner was celebrating his birthday. Initially, those celebrations were held at the unit 2/14 Beaumont Street, Campsie. Not only were the residents of the unit present at that celebration, but also one Ki Dong Kim was present. All the persons I have named so far are of Korean extraction. For convenience I will refer to them by one name only during the course of these remarks.  
     
      
    8 After ingesting alcohol, as well as eating food, for some hours the men departed the unit to go to a local karaoke bar at Campsie. At those premises they continued to ingest alcohol. After spending some hours at the karaoke bar the group then moved to a local hotel or club. Once they had reached those premises they continued to consume alcohol and the prisoner and the deceased played poker machines. After spending some time at those premises the group left, with the intention of returning to their respective homes. 
     
      
    9 While the evidence given at the trial lacks sufficient clarity to make exact findings as to the time actually spent by the group drinking and eating at either 2/14 Beaumont Street, Campsie, the Karaoke bar or the hotel or club, I have no doubt that they ingested a considerable amount of alcohol over a period of some six or seven hours.  
     
      
    10 When the group left the hotel or club, one of them, Mr Ki Dong Kim, said that the deceased and the prisoner began to argue. His evidence was (and it was given by way of a statement tendered which was not tested in cross-examination) that when the three of them reached Beaumont Street, Campsie, the argument between the deceased and the prisoner had elevated into a fight. The fight initially involved the use of fists and Kim indicated that the prisoner, who was both younger and larger than the deceased, was winning the contest. 
     
      
    11 Eventually, the deceased fell to the ground, according to Kim, near the driveway of Kim’s unit, which was situated at number 6 Beaumont Street. Kim said that he then started to push the prisoner away from the deceased. The deceased ran from the immediate area once he had regained his feet, but returned shortly thereafter carrying a round wooden stick roughly 50 centimetres in length. By this time the group had moved to the opposite side of Beaumont Street. Kim stated that the deceased began to strike the prisoner with the stick. Kim attempted to intervene to stop the fight but he himself finished up being knocked to the ground, receiving injuries to his elbow and a cut to his lower lip. 
     
      
    12 He then saw the pair, that is the prisoner and the deceased, moving towards their residence at 14 Beaumont Street. It was Kim’s evidence that he believed that the deceased had thrown the stick away at this time. Kim then went to his own premises and saw nothing else occur between the prisoner and the deceased.  
     
      
    13 Later that evening he heard police and ambulance sirens and went to investigate why this was so. After some confusion as to his role in the altercation which had occurred, he eventually gave a statement to the police at Campsie Police Station, which statement was the one tendered in evidence.  
     
      
    14 Another two persons of Korean extraction, Dong Ho Lim and his wife Eun Nim Choi, lived in a unit at 2-4 Beaumont Street. On the subject evening the pair were entertaining friends at their flat. At about midnight they heard the sound of a fight taking place outside. Mrs Choi heard somebody call out in Korean “Today is my birthday, do you want to die today?”. After hearing that statement Mrs Choi went onto the veranda of her flat to join her husband and saw the accused fighting the deceased. She also saw a third man who was not wearing a shirt – presumably Mr Kim. It was her evidence that the prisoner was winning the fight, continually punching and kicking the deceased. The kicks apparently took place after the deceased had fallen down in front of number 6 Beaumont Street, Campsie – the position where Mr Kim had identified him hitting the ground. Mr Lim had called out to the combatants in Korean to cease fighting otherwise somebody might report their activity to the police. He, like his wife, was of the view that the prisoner appeared to be winning the fight.  
     
      
    15 A Mrs Essenyel and her daughter, a Ms Mete, who lived at unit 1/6 Beaumont Street gave evidence which was contrary to evidence given by other witnesses. Mrs Essenyel deposed that she saw the prisoner hitting two other men with a stick. On the other hand, her daughter believed that it was a man with no shirt (on the evidence presumably Mr Kim) approaching two other men with a stick; a stick which he ultimately threw to the ground. I have drawn no conclusions as to ultimate fact as a consequence of the evidence of either Mrs Essenyel or her daughter. 
     
      
    16 Another resident of number 6 Beaumont Street, Campsie, a Mrs Joung, also gave evidence of her observations made on the subject evening. I should say that she was both a reluctant and difficult witness. While I do not rely upon her observations of the altercation because of this fact, I do accept that after the deceased had finally fallen onto the street she heard the prisoner say that his temper was bad, that is the prisoner’s temper. Indeed, I might say, it was the prisoner who asked Mrs Juong to call the ambulance. 
     
      
    17 A witness of importance was the deceased’s wife, Laner Jin. Having given evidence of the celebrations held earlier in the evening relating to the prisoner’s birthday, she deposed that at about midnight on the subject night she heard noise coming from the lounge room area of the unit. I should add that the unit itself is quite small. On investigating, she saw the prisoner struggling with his mother. The prisoner had a knife in his hand. He appeared angry and ultimately pushed his mother away. He then said ”I will kill Sun Chul” – this being one of the names by which the deceased was known. He then left the unit through the front door. When the door was opened Mrs Jin saw her husband outside. She followed the prisoner. When she reached the footpath she saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand grab the deceased’s arm. The prisoner said “Old bro, are you dying? are you dying?.” The deceased said “Please save me. Please take me to a hospital.” He then collapsed. Mrs Jin went to assist her husband. When she was so doing she heard the prisoner say “Older Bro, please wake up.” Let me say that I accept Mrs Jin as a reliable witness of truth.  
     
      
    18 Shortly before the deceased collapsed, Mrs Choi and Mr Lim, to whom I have made reference earlier, saw the deceased staggering, moving towards their premises. Mr Lim deposed that he saw that the prisoner was walking closely behind the deceased, holding a knife and using it in a stabbing motion very close to the deceased’s body.  
     
      
    19 When ambulance officer’s arrived on the scene they transported the deceased to Canterbury Hospital (which is only a very short distance from the scene) and from there the deceased was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital but, following him suffering a cardiac arrest, he could not be revived, dying at about 12.30am on 1 May.  
     
      
    20 Dr Duflou, forensic pathologist, gave evidence of his findings on autopsy. He deposed that the deceased had died as a consequence of suffering three stab wounds to the chest, which was consistent with either three separate stabbings or a knife having moved within his body three times during the struggle after the initial stabbing. He also found a wound at the back of the deceased’s neck which was consistent with having been inflicted by a knife. Furthermore, he found the presence of injuries to the deceased’s chest, including a broken rib and abrasions to various parts of his body, which were consistent with the deceased having been involved in an altercation. In short, it was Dr Duflou’s evidence that the deceased died as a consequence of stab wounds.  
     
      
    21 The prisoner, in accordance with section 184 of the Evidence Act 1995, made three written admissions which he confirmed orally in court. They were:- 
     
      
       
      “1) That during the course of an argument with Chun Suh Zhe (the deceased) on the night of 30 April 2003 he, Gil Bum Yun, obtained a knife from the kitchen of 2/14 Beaumont Street, Campsie; 
       
       
      2) The knife obtained by him was the knife that caused the wounds to the chest of Chun Suh Zhe and  
       
       
      3) That he, Gil Bum Yun, was holding the knife at the time wounds were occasioned to the chest of Chun Suh Zhe.”  
       
      
    22 I should add that the prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf. During the course of that evidence he deposed to a situation in which he claimed that he had been acting in self-defence at the time of the subject incident. The jury’s verdict indicates that his evidence in this regard was rejected. 
     
      
    23 What then are my findings of fact? On the evidence of Mrs Jin and Mrs Choi, I am of the view that, prior to the stabbing of the deceased, the prisoner had formed an intention to kill. The last of these threats was made within a very short time of the prisoner stabbing the deceased. The jury’s verdict indicates that they did not accept the prisoner’s evidence that the stabbing occurred as a result of either an accident or an action taken in self-defence. In the light of the threats he made and the fact that the deceased suffered at least two stab wounds – the wounds in the chest either being the result of three stab wounds or one stab wound and other wounds created by the subsequent movement of the knife within the deceased’s body – and the wound to his neck, when coupled with the threats he made, lead me to the conclusion that at the time when the prisoner stabbed the deceased he intended to kill him. The fact that the prisoner was intoxicated (as I believe he was) at the time when the stabbing took place is of no assistance to him (see R v Henry (1999) 49 NSWLR 346 at 384-5 per Spigelman CJ).  
     
      
    24 Under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, to which I will hereafter make reference to as the Act, this crime having been committed after 1 February 2003, I am required to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in terms of a range of seriousness. In my view, the fact that the prisoner intended to kill the deceased, as I have found, places this crime somewhere between the mid-range of seriousness and a higher range. The ramifications of this finding I will discuss later in these reasons.  
     
      
    25 I now turn to the subjective matters raised in relation to the prisoner. In this regard, in so far as the prisoner bears an onus of proof, the standard of proof I have applied is a balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    26 The prisoner is a young man, having been born in China, of parents of Korean extraction, on 29 March 1973, making him now thirty-three years of age. I should add that at the trial there was some confusing evidence given as to whether or not his birthday was in March or April, but for the purposes of sentencing that confusion is of no importance. 
     
      
    27 Having been brought up in China and having attended school there the prisoner entered this country in 2000. He is an illegal immigrant, having entered this country under a forged passport and thus holding no valid visa. The Department of Immigration is now aware of this fact. However, for the purposes of sentencing, the fact that he is an illegal immigrant and liable to deportation is not a matter which I should take into account in determining sentence (see R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315). 
     
      
    28 He has no criminal record in this country. In fact, the evidence produced would indicate that he has worked hard since his entry to this country, particularly as a tiler. Accordingly, this conviction, for the purposes of sentencing, is the only black mark on his character. I stress that I have not used the fact that he is an illegal immigrant in any way adverse to the prisoner when considering sentence.  
     
      
    29 Contrary to the Crown’s submission, I am of the view that the prisoner is truly remorseful for his actions. The deceased, while older than the prisoner, was a good friend. Indeed, in the aftermath of the stabbing his statements, as deposed to by Mrs Jin, and his request to Mrs Yun to ring an ambulance, are consistent, in my view, with remorse.  
     
      
    30 In the course of sentencing proceedings evidence was given by a clergyman, Jai Chun Song, of, firstly, remorse expressed by the prisoner for his actions and secondly a sum of money paid by the prisoner to the deceased’s family as recompense for his crime. Enquiries made by police after the initial sentencing hearing confirmed that Mrs Jin had received money from the prisoner. There is some doubt as to the amount actually paid by the prisoner, but it appears to be at least eight thousand dollars. The importance of this payment by the prisoner is that it underscores the fact that he is truly remorseful for his actions. 31 Additionally, in a handwritten statement tendered in the sentencing proceedings, the prisoner has expressed sorrow for not only his actions in causing the death of the deceased, but both sorrow and sympathy for the deceased’s wife and his family in China.  
     
      
    32 It is also the fact that the prisoner will experience hardship above the norm during the term of his imprisonment. I say this because he is a long way from home, China, and his relations and he will thus lack the support which many prisoner’s have from family. 
     
      
    33 A report from a psychologist, Ms Katie Seidler, indicates that the prisoner is depressed following his incarceration. More importantly, she is of the view that the prisoner would not be a person likely to re-offend on release. I have no doubt that this is so. Accordingly, this is a matter which I have taken into account in determining sentence.  
     
      
    34 In short, the prisoner presents as a person of prior good character who, prior to the commission of this offence, had during his time in this country worked hard and well as a tiler. He is not a person who is likely to re-offend. He is a person who will find incarceration more difficult than most for the reasons I have expressed and I accept that he is depressed as a consequence of his incarceration. Furthermore, as I have said, I accept that he is truly remorseful for his actions.  
     
      
    35 As I mentioned at the outset of these remarks, this case falls within the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which apply to crimes committed after 1 February 2003. In particular Part 4 Division 1A and sections 3A, 21A, 54A and 54B apply to the sentencing of this prisoner. These sections require the Court to determine first, whether the offences were in the mid-range of objective seriousness or above that standard. The reason why this is so is because the Act created the concept of standard non-parole periods in this State. Under the legislation the standard non-parole period is applicable to offences which fall within the mid-range of objective seriousness of an offence. As I have already stated, I have found that the commission of this crime falls somewhere between the mid-range of objective seriousness and a higher category. 
     
      
    36 I now turn to an analysis of the Act and the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way and R v Pellew.  
     
      
    37 The provisions of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 have been the subject of recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal (see R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and R v Pellew [2004] NSWCCA 434). In Pellew, Simpson J (who had been a member of the court in Way) summarised the following propositions emerging from Way and subsequent cases as follows:-  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) while s54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; one reason permitting departure from the standard non-parole period is that the offence in question falls outside the middle of that range (para [67]);  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (para [68]); 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74] – [77]); 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the  
        actus reus 
        , the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the  
        mens rea 
         of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85] – [86]); 
        
       
       
        
        (v) that an offence is “typical” or “common” does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (para [101]); 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence: (paras [101] – [102]); 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (para [122]; see also  
        R v GJ 
          
        Davies 
         [2004] NSWCCA 319). 
        
       
       
        
        Finally, it is to be observed that there is nothing in Division 1A that compels a court which finds that an offence is in the mid range of objective gravity to fix the standard non-parole period in respect of that offence. Possible reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period are extensive, as s 21A makes clear.” 
        
       
      
    38 Thus, in considering sentence, I have taken into account the mitigating factors in accordance with S21A of the Act. However, having fully taken into account those matters, I am of the view that this is a case where the standard non-parole period should be applied. The matters in mitigation, in my view, are sufficient for me not to impose a sentence of greater severity than the standard non-parole period set out in the Act, namely, a non-parole period of twenty years. It follows that if the mitigating factors were not of the strength that I have found, that the non-parole period which I would have set would have been longer than the standard period stipulated by the Act. I make this observation because of my finding that objectively this crime falls somewhere above the mid-range in terms of culpability. 
     
      
    39 The prisoner’s sentence will date from the time he went into custody, namely, 9 May 2003. Accordingly, the prisoner is sentenced to a non-parole period of twenty years, commencing on 9 May 2003 and expiring on 8 May 2023, when the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole. The additional term, in accordance with s44 of the Act, is of six years and eight months, commencing on 9 May 2023.

     CORNWELL, Richard Bruce v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a retrial with James Herbert Bolus and others of conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of cocaine (120 kilograms), an offence against s 233B(1)(k) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The appellant revised his grounds of appeal which in final form are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The learned trial judge erred by admitting against the appellant evidence which was the subject of a certificate issued pursuant to section 128 of the  
      Evidence Act. 
       
      2. The learned trial judge erred by referring to the appellant’s former evidence as (a) an admission tendered against the interests of the accused and (b) “a possible version of the facts.” 
       
      3. The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that conversations involving the appellant could be used against him if the jury was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the conversations related to the conspiracy. 
       
      4. The learned trial judge failed to adequately sum up the defence case. 
       
      5. The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
       
      
    2 The Court has received written submissions in relation to each ground but heard oral argument in relation only to grounds one, four and five. At the hearing the Court indicated that if the appeal could not be resolved after consideration of those grounds further oral submissions would be received. As it happens, I am satisfied that the appeal can be resolved by consideration only of grounds one, four and five. 
     
      
       
      Ground One 
       
      
    3 At issue in ground one is the appropriate construction of s 128 of the Evidence Act and its application in the particular circumstances of this case. The appellant was initially tried before Howie J and a jury together with a number of co-accused. Although some of the accused were convicted, the jury was not able to agree in relation to the appellant and a new trial was ordered. This required the appellant to again be arraigned and a new indictment was prepared.  
     
      
    4 At his first trial the appellant gave evidence. He did so after consideration had been given by the trial judge to whether or not a certificate would be granted pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995. The trial judge granted a certificate, although it did not formally issue until much later, and the appellant gave evidence.  
     
      
    5 At his second trial the Crown sought to tender the transcript of the appellant’s evidence given in cross-examination. This was opposed, but the trial judge ruled that he would admit it. His Honour gave a narrow construction to the operation of the certificate granted by Howie J. After it became apparent that the trial judge would admit the transcript of the cross-examination, the appellant sought the tender of the whole of his evidence which in fact occurred. The appellant did not give oral evidence at the second trial 
     
      
    6 The appellant submits that the trial judge, at the second trial, erred by admitting the whole of the transcript of his cross-examination and accordingly submits that the trial miscarried. The fundamental submission is that the certificate issued by Howie J operates in accordance with its terms and prohibited the tender, at the very least, of some of the appellant’s evidence given at his second trail. 
     
      
    7 The Crown responds in two ways. Firstly, it is submitted that the trial judge was correct in construing the certificate in a manner which allowed the admission of the whole of the transcript of the appellant’s examination at his first trial. Secondly, the Crown brings an appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and submits that this Court should now determine that the certificate issued by Howie J was not authorised by s 128 and should be quashed. If this occurs, it is submitted that no question of error in the admission of the evidence could arise. 
     
      
       
      The conspiracy – the Crown case 
       
      
    8 The conspiracy with which the appellant was charged involved an alleged agreement between the appellant and John Lawrence, as the principals, and a number of other persons to import 120 kilograms of cocaine from Columbia. The Crown alleges that the drug importation venture involved cooperation between two groups. One group was operating in South America and was to obtain the drugs and conceal them in a ship which would transport them into Australian waters. The Australian group would arrange to pick up the drugs and bring them into Australia. 
     
      
    9 An eleven metre sailing vessel named the “Flaning” was utilised for the enterprise. On board was a Boston whaler dingy with the cocaine concealed within its structure. 
     
      
    10 The person liaising between the Columbian group and the Australian group was alleged to be Juan Guillermo Diez Orozco (“Diez”), an Australian citizen of Columbian origin. He became involved in making the arrangements and liaising with the Australian end of the venture. He also played a significant role as an interpreter.  
     
      
    11 It is alleged that the Australian arm of the venture was organised by the appellant and his associate Lawrence. From mid 2000 Lawrence had been under surveillance by the National Crime Authority as he was suspected of involvement in illicit drug activity. It was during this surveillance that the National Crime Authority learned of the proposed importation.  
     
      
    12 In early 2001, the appellant commenced looking for a boat that was capable of effecting a rendezvous off the Australian coast with the boat carrying the cocaine from South America. This was done and arrangements were made to use the premises of a friend of Lawrence, David Norris at Telegraph Point near Port Macquarie as the base for the drug retrieval operation. Lawrence also enlisted James Bolus, whose appeal has been heard together with that of the appellant, to assist in the acquisition of a motor vehicle suitable to tow the Zodiac craft which they had purchased and to organise payment for that craft. The Crown alleges that Bolus’ primary object in relation to these matters was to ensure that there was no discernible association between Lawrence, the boat and the vehicle. Bolus allegedly became Lawrence’s confidante. 
     
      
    13 A four-wheel drive vehicle was also purchased and registered in the name of one of the other alleged conspirators. 
     
      
    14 On 8 April 2001 the Flaning departed from Panama with the cocaine in the dinghy on board. In early May, Lawrence, McDougall (an alleged conspirator) and another person by the name of Dominic Brokenshire (“Brokenshire” or “Brock”) travelled to Melbourne to collect the boat known as a Zodiac to use in the enterprise. The funds for the acquisition of the boat were paid by way of cash into an account of the broker by Bolus, using the false name of Mathew Benns.  
     
      
    15 The boat was taken to Sydney where it was stored and was later collected by Lawrence, McDougall and Brokenshire and was towed to Telegraph Point. 
     
      
    16 The alleged conspirators ultimately determined an appropriate rendezvous point with the drugs at a position 120 miles off Port Macquarie. On 24 May 2001 Lawrence, Diez and another member of the operation, Wouter, travelled to Telegraph Point to prepare the Zodiac for the enterprise. They took it for a test-run on 19 June 2001 at which time the National Crime Authority had been continuing its monitoring activities. Apparently the National Crime Authority wrongly believed that the drugs had been collected and they arrested Wouter, Norris, Lawrence and another person, Gladman after the Zodiac had returned that evening. When he was questioned, Gladman agreed to assist the National Crime Authority and not divulge that fact to the others involved in the venture. The other four who had been arrested were all released. 
     
      
    17 Following their release Lawrence, Wouter, Norris and Gladman discussed the fact that the operation had been compromised. Nevertheless a decision was made that the venture should continue and by this time the Flaning was well on its way to Australia. The plan was changed and it was decided to locate a suitable shallow part of the sea off the Australian coast where the drugs could be deposited and later retrieved. 
     
      
    18 Eventually the Kelso Bank, which is about 350 miles off the Queensland coast, was chosen as the site to deposit the drugs. The cocaine was packed into cylinders and tied down with chains and marine batteries before being put into the sea. The Flaning, minus the drugs, arrived in Southport, Queensland on 7 July 2001. Arrangements were made for a number of persons living in the Philippines, including an Australian named Bill Percy, to become involved in the venture to retrieve the drugs. However, the National Crime Authority’s investigations proved successful and, ultimately, Wouter was arrested at Sydney airport as he was about to leave for South America. 
     
      
    19 On 6 August 2001 Wouter, members of Australian Customs, the National Crime Authority and Queensland police went by boat to the drug deposit site at Kelso Bank. Scuba divers located chains, wire and marine batteries but the containers with the drugs were not found. 
     
      
    20 Between 5 and 9 August 2001, the remaining known participants in the venture were all arrested. Some of the conspirators pleaded guilty and were sentenced, but the others stood trial before Howie J. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s involvement – the Crown case 
       
      
    21 The Crown alleges that the appellant was a prime mover in the Australian arm of the venture. It is alleged that the appellant reached agreement with Diez in relation to the collection, receipt and distribution of the cocaine which was to be imported. In order to minimise his chances of detection and arrest the appellant brought Lawrence into the conspiracy to liaise with Diez and physically organise the shipment of the cocaine onto Australian shores and thence to Sydney. The appellant was to share in the profits of the cocaine distribution with Lawrence. 
     
      
    22 In summary it is alleged that the appellant did the following as part of the conspiracy: 
     
      
    · agreed with Diez that 120 kilograms of cocaine would be imported into Australia;· agreed with Diez that he (Cornwall) would organise the distribution of the cocaine upon its arrival;· introduced Diez to Lawrence the person who would physically organise the transhipment of the drugs;· agreed with Lawrence as to the price that would be charged for the imported cocaine on distribution;· engaged Mark Rowell (a boat broker) to locate a suitable boat to rendezvous with the South Americans;· provided funds for “tools” (ie the boat, trailer, vehicle to tow the boat, radios etc.) from drug distribution;· provided advice and counsel to Lawrence on how the enterprise should be performed. 
     
      
    23 When giving evidence at the first trial the appellant agreed that his voice appears in each of the relevant listening device tapes and that he was in discussion with Diez or Lawrence. The appellant admitted that from March 2001 he was engaged in distributing cocaine with Lawrence and that his role included the collection of the money for the distributed cocaine and payment to Diez for the supply. The appellant agreed that the conversations on the tapes concerned the distribution and importation of cocaine. He also agreed that he was in regular contact with Diez after 24 March (the date of the last recorded conversation between Diez and the appellant) but that these meetings did not occur in the appellant’s flat. The appellant claimed that although he discussed the possible importation of cocaine with Diez and Lawrence these discussions were merely preliminary and tentative discussions and that eventually he never agreed to be part of an importation venture. 
     
      
    24 The Crown submits that although the appellant claimed that he only commenced dealing in cocaine in March 2001 ie after the listening device was inserted into his premises, it is apparent that by at least January or February 2001, the appellant was receiving cocaine from Diez for distribution. This is demonstrated by the extensive dealership network which the appellant had in place which is confirmed in the recorded conversations. 
     
      
    25 The listening device was not placed into the appellant’s premises until 7 March 2001. On 9 March 2001, from 1.36 pm to 1.50 pm, a conversation is recorded between the appellant and Diez. During the conversation the appellant shows Diez a document which he says is an “investigation plan” or an “operation plan” that was obtained from a police officer. The appellant tells Diez that the document relates to June the year before and that it contains Lawrence’s name (Cornwall refers to Lawrence by one of his nicknames, Josie). The purpose of showing Diez a document it is submitted is to impress Diez of Lawrence’s importance and to vouch for Lawrence as a person who could be trusted. The appellant recommends Josie/Lawrence to Diez as “one of the best men I have ever known in my life.” The appellant tells Diez that Josie “is a boss mate, he doesn’t do the work … He is the boss of the work.” In this conversation, the appellant was endeavouring to persuade Diez that Lawrence was a person who could be entrusted with the responsibility of organising the collection of the cocaine which was going to be imported. It was apparent that the appellant did not want to expose himself to arrest by being physically involved in the collection of the cocaine, but wanted Lawrence to perform this role. 
     
      
    26 On 13 March 2001 at 6.25 pm a further conversation was recorded between the appellant and Diez. Diez is waiting to receive an overseas telephone call from “the boss” concerning the shipment of cocaine. The appellant is very anxious that Diez get this call. They discuss why it has taken so long for the call to come. The appellant and Diez later discuss the method which Diez will use to contact the appellant from overseas. Diez is to ring the appellant’s telephone number and having agreed the procedure, without having to answer the telephone, the appellant will know that the call is from him. The appellant is then to call Diez from a public phone. The appellant indicates that he will use a different public telephone on each occasion. The appellant informs Diez of the times he is at home each morning to ensure he will be present to receive the call. They then agree to go out and telephone Josie/Lawrence (from a public telephone). 
     
      
    27 There is a further conversation on 24 March 2001. In this conversation the appellant speaks with Diez and expresses concern about the problems of distributing large amounts of cocaine having regard to the present market conditions for the substance. Diez complains that the cocaine, which the appellant had received from Diez, had not been distributed quickly enough and claims that he was receiving pressure about non-payment from his South American suppliers. Diez expresses concern about what will happen when the large amount of cocaine proposed to be imported arrives. At one stage Diez is recorded as saying “I dealing with very, very, very heavy people there … my family … there … putting pressure on me.” At one point Diez expresses regret that the importation is already underway saying “I wish they can turn around and go back home believe me, that’s what I want now.” The appellant replied saying “Well, you’re talking shit, now.” 
     
      
    28 There is a further conversation recorded on a listening device on 4 April 2001 between the appellant and Lawrence. The appellant gives Lawrence an account of his recent conversations with Diez and complains that Diez may be supplying cocaine to other distributors and under-cutting their market. They talk about the price of the boat both with and without engines, understood by the Crown to be the boat which was under consideration to carry out the drug importation enterprise. 
     
      
    29 There is a further conversation recorded between the appellant and Lawrence on 9 April 2001 when they discuss drug distribution. They refer to the forthcoming importation and argue about their respective roles. Lawrence complains that he is doing the running around and thereby exposing himself to arrest whilst the appellant does very little. Lawrence complains about being in the “firing line all the time”. The appellant remonstrates with Lawrence that he gets upset too easily and that “if its gonna be so much pressure then and you can’t cope mate you’re better off fucking not doing it … .” Lawrence accuses the appellant of not pulling his weight to which the appellant responds “well I handle everything but all I’m saying is, if this job gets lost …” it will be Lawrence’s fault. Lawrence is recorded as saying, “You haven’t anything to handle.” The appellant responds “Well that’s not the point I’ve got all the buyers, all bar the Coogee fucking mob”, and “I got the gear for us.” Lawrence accuses the appellant of not being able to handle Diez to which the appellant responds, “I’m handling him, but I told you he’s ready to fucking fold over this cunt, I’m telling you … he’s a weak cunt. You’ve seen it, he’s a cry baby.” The appellant says to Lawrence “you don’t want to talk or discuss anything and we’re supposed to be fuckin partners”, and “all I want from you is that you’ll be able to handle this bloke” (understood as a reference to Diez). 
     
      
    30 The conversation later moves to the arrangements being made to handle the importation and how Lawrence is “running out of fuckin time.” Lawrence says: “… I’m trying to make arrangements I’ve been running around all fucking morning.” Lawrence refers to “this fuckin boat” and going down to Melbourne to pick it up. Lawrence talks about other things he has to organise, including the purchase of a four-wheel drive vehicle. The appellant indicates that he could handle the purchase of a vehicle, and refers to the particular vehicle. The appellant also refers to Lawrence’s friend (Norris) who has a “place up the river.” The appellant suggests that Lawrence can “shoot out from there and pick it (cocaine) up.” Lawrence indicates that he will go and investigate the proposed arrangements. 
     
      
    31 A further conversation is recorded between the appellant and Lawrence on 12 April 2001. In that conversation reference is made to putting money towards the purchase of the tools and to other activities allegedly related to the conspiracy. The appellant tells Lawrence about his conversations with Diez who he says: “carries on like a big shot” and how Diez had told him that he had to go to New York the following week to “these people’s boss.” The appellant refers to Diez’s concerns about moving the cocaine and refers jokingly to the possibility of having to “eat it.” There is also discussion between them about the earnings which they can expect from the distribution of cocaine. The appellant tells Lawrence that they had averaged about $110,000 per kilo in recently times. Lawrence also informs the appellant that he purchased a Glock pistol and some ammunition. They also discuss methods of bringing the cocaine from the overseas boat and getting it on-shore. 
     
      
    32 A further conversation is recorded on 13 April 2001 between the appellant and Lawrence. They discuss “this big job that’s coming up” and also discuss the subsequent distribution of cocaine. They speak in terms of distributing 25 kilograms at a time. They also agree a plan to secure the drugs until they have been distributed. They agree on selling the drugs at $110,000 per kilogram. 
     
      
    33 On 20 April 2001 the appellant and Lawrence are recorded by video camera in conversation on the balcony of the appellant’s premises. The conversation is also recorded on a listening device. They discuss plans to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle, and refer to firearms and shotguns, and having to “sit down over weekend and go over it” (understood as a reference to the plan). Lawrence says “Yeah well my end’s set. I know what I am doing … .” They discuss locations from which the boat can depart, and refer to the boat going “straight out to sea.” They discuss Diez going to New York. The appellant refers to “when the big one comes in” and possible methods of distribution and costs. Lawrence informs the appellant that he is going to suggest that “two blokes” go out on the boat to make the rendezvous and that each of them receive $200,000. The appellant agrees. Lawrence continues to inform the appellant of the roles he has in mind for various people, including Norris, McDougall and Brokenshire. The appellant informs Lawrence that Diez had put off the arrival of “the Dutchman” until Diez returns from New York. They also discuss a pistol, the purchase of walkie-talkies and how to pay for the boat in cash so as to ensure that it could not be traced back to them. 
     
      
    34 A further conversation is recorded on 11 May 2001 between the appellant and Lawrence. They are heard leaving the flat together but there are no other discussions. 
     
      
    35 On 24 May 2001 Lawrence collected Wouter to take him up to Telegraph Point. Before leaving Sydney, Lawrence was observed making two telephone calls from a public call box. One of the calls was to Norris’ telephone at Telegraph Point the other was to the appellant. The call to the appellant was intercepted and recorded. In the call Lawrence refers to meeting up with the appellant. No effort was actually made by either of them to meet. The Crown suggests that the conversation is a pre-arranged code whereby Lawrence informed the appellant that he had picked up Wouter and he was going to Telegraph Point. 
     
      
    36 On 15 June 2001 a telephone call intercept on the appellant’s telephone records the voices of Lawrence and the appellant. At this time Lawrence was at Telegraph Point. Lawrence telephones the appellant from a public call box and asks the appellant to ring him back as he is running out of money. The appellant says he will ring straight back: “As long as it takes me to get to a phone.” No further telephone call was intercepted and on 19 June the arrests were made at Dunbogan. Notwithstanding these arrests the enterprise continued. 
     
      
    37 A further short conversation is recorded on the listening device at the appellant’s premises at 9 July 2001 when Lawrence was present. They are heard leaving the flat but no conversation is recorded. 
     
      
    38 On 7 and 8 August the appellant was apparently attempting to make contact with Diez but the latter was arrested before contact was made. There was also evidence of the appellant dialling Mark Rowell’s mobile telephone number from a public telephone on 8 August 2001. 
     
      
    39 The appellant was arrested on 9 August 2001. Amongst documents seized from him was an old address book with the name “Jim Bolus” and the latter’s telephone number and a piece of paper with the names “David Norris-John Lawrence” written on it. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s defence and the sequence of events at the first trial 
       
      
    40 The appellant submitted at his first trial that although he is recorded as having conversations with Lawrence and others in relation to drug activities these should be understood as relating exclusively to domestic drug deals and were not related to any proposed importation of cocaine in respect of which the appellant denied he was a party. Accordingly, the evidence which he gave admits to involvement in illegal drug activities but the appellant says this was confined entirely to domestic dealings. 
     
      
    41 The appellant was called at his first trial on 5 May 2003. He was asked some questions by his counsel to identify him and establish his relationship with relevant persons. He was asked about his knowledge of Diez and the nature of their relationship. He was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        Q: Alright. Some time after you re-established contact with Mr Diez, did he raise with you the possibility of involvement in some form of illegal activity? 
        
       
       
        
        A: In February. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You may wish to reserve your legal rights here in answer to this question, Mr Cornwall: what did he say to you about the possibility of your involvement in some illegal activity? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Well, I don’t want to answer that on the grounds of it may incriminate me. 
        
       
      
    42 At this point counsel referred to the fact that the matter which had been previously discussed between counsel and his Honour was now squarely raised. It was indicated that unless the matter was resolved it would not be possible to proceed with Mr Cornwall’s evidence.  
     
      
    43 There had been an earlier discussion between counsel who appeared for the appellant and his Honour in which counsel indicated that he wished to flag the issue “just to get some guidance about the procedures.” Counsel said he expected Mr Cornwall to give some evidence but that he would wish to object to giving evidence about the distribution of cocaine in Sydney where it was the subject of some of these discussions that had gone into in evidence “and I would be seeking a certificate under s 128 in relation to that. At some stage your Honour will need to consider what procedures should be undertaken when we come to it.”  
     
      
    44 His Honour indicated at that stage, but without any argument, that he thought that the appellant may be entitled to the certificate. His Honour said that it is not part of the charge for which he stands indicted. Counsel responds by saying “it is not a fact in issue as the subsection says. It is evidence that is led in order to prove a fact in issue. It is s 128(7) and (8).” Counsel makes plain that the resolution of whether or not a certificate will be available may have a bearing on the hearing. Counsel says “it might have some considerable bearing on whether or not he should give evidence. If he stands liable for prosecution for very serious criminal charges which have not been charged because of a lack of evidence at the moment … .” 
     
      
    45 At a later point in the transcript his Honour says “you see it is this [sic] my view if Mr Cornwall were asked questions in relation to the involvement of cocaine or other drugs, he would be entitled to take the claim of privilege.” The Crown Prosecutor responds by saying: “Again, I would wait and see what the question is.” His Honour says: “I understand that it depends on what the question is. It seems to me though that s 128(8) is very restrictive and much more restrictive than the common law ever was. It really is suggested that the only evidence that he cannot take or an accused cannot take the claim in is in respect of evidence concerning the act or the state of mind. All of those other matters are merely provisions of the act of mens rea.” 
     
      
    46 Later his Honour says: 
     
      
       
        
        “… but let’s take it as it comes because, as I understand it at the present time, the only issue is in relation to, for example, conversations or suggestions that he was, at the time of those conversations, involved in the business of trafficking drugs in other words, not about his involvement in the conspiracy so much as involvement in other material which you are perfectly entitled to rely upon as showing, for example, motive or relationship and all of those things in order to prove involvement which are not themselves part of the act of conspiracy.” 
        
       
      
    47 The Crown Prosecutor responds by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will wait and see what happens.” 
        
       
      
    48 Following a short adjournment counsel for the appellant outlines the course he proposes to take. He says this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just so that your Honour understands where things are likely to proceed from here on end [sic]: I will open to the jury. I will call Mr Cornwall. In the very early stages of his evidence-in-chief I will ask him a question. He will decline to answer that on the grounds it might tend to incriminate him. Then I expect that your Honour would wish to hear either argument or perhaps further evidence in the absence of the jury before determining whether or not to issue a certificate under s 128.” 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour responds by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Alright. Let’s proceed and see what happens. I was just going to say this: I make it clear to those who maybe interested in it and may be considering what course to take in the defence case, my present view is that it will not be open to the jury to find that there are two conspiracies.” 
        
       
      
    50 The course contemplated by counsel is followed and when objection is taken the jury are excused and discussion between counsel and the judge follows. Counsel for the appellant outlines the evidence which the appellant will give. It is indicated that it will include evidence of an agreement between Diez and Lawrence as to the distribution of cocaine which was already present in Australia. Later his Honour asked counsel how “Mr Cornwall would be prejudiced in the conduct of his defence if he were not granted a certificate.” Counsel explains there are two ways. Firstly, he would have to claim the privilege against self-incrimination answer by answer and that would tend to highlight an issue which is not the ultimate issue in the trial. Counsel later says: “part of the problem is that some of the conversations about these two inter-related topics are so intertwined as to make that difficult to tease out the differences between the two.” 
     
      
    51 To this remark his Honour responds: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is the Crown’s complaint, I suppose, that in fact it is part and parcel of the same conversation. The difficulty I have unfortunately with the Crown’s argument is that it is not what the section is talking about and where the Crown is relying, as it is entitled to do, on other criminal activity other than the subject charge, and an accused person should be entitled to defend himself without making himself open to be prosecuted for that material. I don’t know enough about what Mr Cornwall may or may not say; is it suggested, for example, that Mr Cornwall cannot talk about his relationship with Mr Diez and what is said to be the breakdown in that relationship which led to, as I understand, directly to Mr Cornwall’s failure to become involved in the conspiracy, because of the inability to talk about that offence, those offences?” 
        
       
      
    52 Counsel responds: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that is right, I think that’s right, if his only answer to the question is an exercise of the privilege against self incrimination, a large part of the narrative which explains the extent of his dealings with Mr Diez and Mr Lawrence in relation to the instant charge will not be given in evidence.” 
        
       
      
    53 Later, his Honour is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would have thought any evidence by Mr Cornwall of his arrangement with Mr Diez as to the supply of cocaine generally regardless of who it is to, is a relevant fact before the jury but it is not a fact in issue. We are passed that bar.  
        
       
       
        
        If I grant him a certificate in relation to his involvement with Diez generally in relation to the distribution of cocaine and Lawrence in the distribution of cocaine, do you say I should grant a certificate or not in the interests of justice?” 
        
       
      
    54 The Crown Prosecutor responds to this remark by saying “We don’t want to put any submissions if your Honour is of that view because we don’t think it will assist. We are fundamentally of [sic] that issue so we wouldn’t put any submission.” 
     
      
    55 His Honour responds by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t understand that. If I come to a view he is entitled to a claim of privilege, why the Crown cannot make submissions in respect of me granting a certificate so that he takes the claim of privilege without anything being said about the matter … . 
        
       
      
    56 The Crown interrupts and says: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because interest of justice involves a large number of features and that being so, we don’t wish to say anything about that particular matter, whether or not your Honour grants a certificate in relation to that particular piece of evidence.” 
        
       
      
    57 At that point the transcript records his Honour as giving a judgment about the matter. In that judgment his Honour identifies the fact that an issue has arisen as to whether the appellant is entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination “in respect of evidence that he would give as to his relationship with two of the co-accused in this trial, Diez and Lawrence.” His Honour says his understanding is that “the accused, Cornwall, will give evidence, if he is permitted to do so without making himself liable for a prosecution for any other offence than the offence charged, that he, Diez and Lawrence, were from about January 2001 involved in the distribution of cocaine in New South Wales, that cocaine having been previously brought into the country by Diez or persons associated with him.” 
     
      
    58 It is plain that the issue arose because of the tender by the Crown of evidence of conversations involving the appellant and Diez and Lawrence and the appellant in which it was open for the jury to find that those persons had been involved in the distribution of narcotics. His Honour says: 
     
      
       
        
        “As well as those conversations containing references to what the jury might find was the supply of drugs, the conversations also contain material that the jury might find was relevant to the charge before them in a more direct way, that is as to the involvement of those three persons in the conspiracy to import cocaine which is the subject of the charge. To some extent the different types of material in the conversations are intertwined. I admitted the evidence of conversations suggesting that Cornwall and Diez and Cornwall and Lawrence were involved in the distribution of drugs on the basis of the principle set out in  
        Harriman v The Queen  
        (1989) 167 CLR 590. I do not intend to indicate again why I believe that this evidence was highly relevant to the Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    59 His Honour identified that consideration had been given to the application of s 128 of the Evidence Act. His Honour then had regard to the meaning of “fact in issue” in the trial. The submission of the Crown before Howie J was that the involvement of the appellant in the supply of drugs was a fact in issue such was its importance to the proof of the offence charged. His Honour when indicating that he did not accept the submission had regard to the fact that the expression appeared in other sections in the Act, in particular s 55 and s 94. His Honour also had regard to the relevant report of the Australian Law Reform Commission where in Report No 26 Vol 1 at para 641 note 3 it is stated that the expression “fact in issue” should be interpreted as referring to the issues in the proceedings defined by substantive law and pleadings and thus would extend to facts to be proved in undefended or ex parte proceedings.” His Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…a fact in issue in a criminal trial is any matter that must be ultimately determined by the jury in order to decide whether or not an accused person is guilty of the offence charged. A fact in issue in a criminal trial would generally be an element of the offence charged but might include any other matter that must be determined in order to find the accused criminally liable for that offence. It may include the issue of mental illness, self defence, or any statutory defences and, in a charge of murder, issues such as provocation and substantial mental impairment. They are examples of the fundamental issues that the jury must resolve in order to determine the charge brought by the Crown against the accused.” 
        
       
      
    60 His Honour indicated that a fact in issue was not merely any fact in dispute in the proceedings. It does not include those factual disputes the resolution of which may merely assist the jury in determining whether the accused has committed the offence charged. 
     
      
    61 His Honour referred to s 94 and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is made clear by the reference to the term in s 94. That section is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘94 Application 
           
          (1) This Part does not apply to evidence that relates only to the credibility of a witness. 
           
          (2) This Part does not apply so far as a proceeding relates to bail or sentencing. 
           
          (3) This Part does not apply to evidence of: 
           
            
            (a) the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or 
             
            (b) a tendency that a person has or had, if that character, reputation, conduct or tendency is a fact in issue.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In order to determine whether Part 3.6 applies, and whether the tendency rule and the coincidence rule have any application, it is necessary to know whether the character, reputation, conduct or tendency of a person is a fact in issue in the proceedings. Because it is necessary for the party wishing to tender evidence falling within the tendency or coincidence rules to give reasonable notice of its intention to do so, there must be some understanding of what will be a fact in issue in advance of the proceedings. The question whether the Part applies and, therefore, the rules operate to exclude otherwise relevant evidence cannot depend upon the manner in which the proceedings are conducted by the parties. The character, reputation, conduct, or tendency of a person is a fact in issue only where any of those matters have to be determined in order to resolve the proceedings before the court. This is consistent with the view adopted by the Australian Law Reform Commission, see Report No 26 vol 1 paragraph 786. Odgers cites examples of proceedings where such a matter might be a fact in issue, see at [1.3.6480]. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe that this view is supported in the judgment of the High Court in  
        Smith v The Queen  
        (2001) 206 CLR 650. The Court was there concerned with the relevance of evidence given by police officers purporting to identify the accused in security photos taken during an armed robbery. In the course of their joint judgment, their Honours Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated (footnotes not included): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          [7] In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt 3.1 of the Act and s 55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that the reference to the ‘ultimate issues’ is a reference to the facts in issue for the purposes of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . Earlier their Honours noted that the Crown case was that the appellant was the person who was shown in the security photographs, apparently keeping lookout while the co-offenders took the money. The joint judgment then states: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          [4] It was, therefore, a fact in issue on the trial of the appellant whether the appellant, the person standing trial, is the person depicted at the right-hand side of some of the security photographs. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        As it was an element of the offence charged that the accused was a participant in the robbery (that is, that it was his act), and as the Crown sought to prove that element by identifying the accused as the person in the photograph, it is understandable that the Court should refer to the issue of identification as a fact in issue. Clearly this is an example of those cases where it would be appropriate to refer to a particular disputed factual matter as a fact in issue because the resolution of that fact will itself resolve a fact in issue. In other words, the particular factual dispute is synonymous with the relevant fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    62 Consistent with this approach to the question of a fact in issue his Honour determined that whether the appellant or any of the alleged conspirators were involved at the time of the alleged importation in the domestic trafficking of narcotic goods was not a fact in issue in the trial. It was not “an ultimate fact for the jury to resolve in order to find the charge of importation proved.” It followed that s 128(8) had no application to the proposed evidence in the present case. Accordingly, Howie J held that the appellant was entitled to refuse to answer a question “on the ground that the answer may incriminate him in relation to his involvement in the ongoing distribution of narcotic goods at or about the time of the alleged conspiracy. In particular, he is entitled to refuse to answer questions as to his relationship with other accused, in this case Diez and Lawrence, with regard to the distribution of drugs that were at the time in his possession or in the possession of some person associated with him.” 
     
      
    63 His Honour then turns to consider the practical application of this conclusion in the appellant’s trial. Concluding that the Crown sought to put the evidence of drug supply before the jury in support of the charge of importation his Honour determined that the appellant should be able to put forward his defence to that charge without putting himself at risk of being prosecuted for other serious criminal activity.  
     
      
    64 His Honour then addresses the question of whether or not the appellant should be given a certificate under s 128. It must be remembered that a certificate can be provided either pursuant to s 128(3) or s 128(6). A certificate may be given under s 128(3) in circumstances where a witness has been advised that he or she need not give the evidence the subject of the relevant objection but nevertheless chooses to do so. In these circumstances subs (3) requires the court to issue a certificate. No question as to whether or not the evidence should be given in the interests of justice is raised.  
     
      
    65 The position is different in relation to subs (6). A certificate under that subs must be given in circumstances where the court has required a witness to answer the question. Before the court may require the witness to answer, the judge must be satisfied, inter alia, that the interests of justice require that the witness give the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    66 Howie J does not identify whether or not the appellant would be entitled to a certificate under subs (3) or subs(6). Without consideration of the matters arising in s 128(2) his Honour turns attention to whether or not the appellant should be required to answer the relevant questions and whether or not this would be in the interests of justice. His Honour then proceeds to balance what he refers to as competing interests and the need for a fair trial of the appellant and other accused. His Honour remarks that the Crown provided no assistance in the resolution of this problem. This was apparently because the Crown had taken a view that it was wrong to permit the appellant to rely upon the privilege and the Crown did not wish to assist the court further in relation to the matter. His Honour concludes by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “In those circumstances, it is my present opinion that, if Cornwall refuses to answer questions about his involvement in the ongoing supply of drugs on the grounds that it might incriminate him, he is entitled to take that stance, but in the interests of justice I would require him to answer the questions and grant him a certificate in accordance with the section.” 
        
       
      
    67 In these circumstances it would appear that his Honour had concluded that the appellant was entitled to a certificate pursuant to subs (6) his Honour having required him to answer the relevant questions. 
     
      
    68 Following delivery of his Honour’s judgment counsel for the appellant raised the question of how the decision was to be given practical application. Counsel is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well your Honour, given the fact that the accused has claimed the privilege against self incrimination already, and given that I have outlined as much as I have about what it is he is about to say in evidence if granted a certificate, would your Honour grant him a certificate now?” 
        
       
      
    69 His Honour replies: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, I grant him a certificate in relation to evidence that he will give in answer to any question concerning an involvement between himself and Diez and Lawrence and any other person in the supply or trafficking in narcotic goods between what dates?” 
        
       
      
    70 It is then agreed that the certificate should issue in respect of the period between 1 January 2001 and 10 August 2001. 
     
      
    71 The jury returned to the court and his Honour informed them of the fact that the appellant has been granted the relevant certificate. His Honour says that rather than the appellant having to take the objection every time somebody asks a question relating to his relationship with Mr Diez or any person in the distribution of prohibited drugs or narcotics which were present in Australia a certificate would be issued giving him the relevant immunity. 
     
      
    72 The appellant then proceeded to give evidence in chief and was cross-examined in relation, inter alia, to the matters the subject of the certificate. 
     
      
       
      The issue of the Certificate 
       
      
    73 As it happens a certificate was not physically issued in the course of the trial. That fact was only discovered after the second trial had commenced and the question was raised as to the admissibility of the transcript of the appellant’s evidence at his first trial. When the question was raised, arrangements were made for the parties to again approach Howie J where argument ensued as to whether a certificate could now be issued. His Honour resolved that argument in favour of the appellant and granted a certificate in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court certifies under section 128 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        1995 of New South Wales that evidence in these proceedings by Richard Bruce Cornwall on 5 May 2003, 6 May 2003, 7 May 2003, 8 May 2003, 9 May 2003 and 12 May 2003 in relation to Richard Bruce Cornwall’s involvement with Juan Guillermo Diez-Orozco, John Lawrence and other person in the supply or trafficking in narcotic goods between the 1st January and 10th August 2001 is evidence to which section 128(7) of that Act applies.” 
        
       
      
    74 Notwithstanding the fact that Howie J had made plain in the course of the trial that he would grant the appellant a certificate, and the fact that it had not actually been formally granted was an oversight, the Crown objected to his Honour granting a certificate at the later point in time. His Honour records the fact that the Crown contended that no certificate should issue given the delay in seeking it and the use to be made of it in the trial before Blackmore DCJ. It is difficult to understand this submission. His Honour had made plain that a certificate would be issued and evidence had been given upon that assumption. Delay in issuing the formal document could hardly be relevant to whether or not the protection afforded by s 128 should be available. Whether or not the certificate which his Honour had indicated he would issue provided the relevant protection was not a matter to be raised with Howie J, but, rather, for the trial judge in any proceedings where the evidence was proposed to be tendered. 
     
      
    75 In his judgment in relation to the issue of the certificate Howie J considers the position which had been reached in the trial before Blackmore DCJ. It is apparent that Blackmore DCJ had determined that the trial before him was a different proceedings to that which had taken place before Howie J. Acknowledging this conclusion Howie J professes the view that it “was not my intention, nor was it ever suggested during the course of argument, that the certificate could be used by the accused to protect himself from the use of his evidence in the proceedings of the charge in respect of which the evidence was given. This may be the result of the fact that no-one turned his or her mind to the possibility of another trial of the charge then being prosecuted. Had that possibility been raised I would have taken it into account in determining whether to require the applicant to answer the question on the basis that he would be protected from the further use of that evidence in any proceeding.” 
     
      
    76 His Honour expressed difficulty in justifying as a matter of policy a decision which would permit an accused to give evidence in a trial on the basis that some or all of it could not be used against him in any subsequent proceedings for the same offence. 
     
      
    77 Notwithstanding the use which was proposed to be made of the certificate his Honour concluded that he is functus in relation to the trial and accordingly evidentiary rulings cannot now be revisited. His Honour says:  
     
      
       
        
        “I cannot see how I could refuse to give a certificate to an accused by reason of events that have occurred after the accused was told that he must answer the questions asked but that a certificate would be issued in respect of those answers. Where a witness, including an accused, has been required to answer a question notwithstanding that a valid objection has been taken on the grounds of privilege against self incrimination, the witness is entitled to have the certificate given to him. Section 128 is mandatory in that if the witness gives evidence under s 128(2) or is required to give evidence under s 128(5) the court ‘is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under the section in respect of the evidence.’ The issuing of the certificate is a purely administrative step and the court has no discretion in respect of the matter.” 
        
       
      
    78 His Honour offered some further comments in relation to the operation of the section. His Honour concluded that if the effect of granting of the certificate in the trial which he conducted is to deprive the Crown of part of the evidence given by the appellant in that trial at a further hearing of the charge in respect of which the evidence was given, then his Honour suggests that either the meaning attributed to the word “proceeding” in s 128(7) would preclude that outcome or the section should be amended. The Australian Law Reform Commission has now taken that matter up in Report 102, Uniform Evidence Law, [15-106]-[15-107] and Recommendation 15-7. 
     
      
       
      The trial before Blackmore DCJ 
       
      
    79 As I have already indicated Blackmore DCJ first determined that the retrial was a “proceeding” for the purpose of s 128(7). 
     
      
    80 In part his Honour took this view because of the approach which he took to s 128(8). His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “By reason of the operation of this section, the Crown is not reduced to the situation where it is unable to tender the evidence given by the accused in the former proceedings before Howie J. It can tender such evidence provided that it is evidence intended to prove the matters outlined in subs (8)(a) or (b).” 
        
       
      
    81 In my opinion this approach to the problem does not accord with the section. Section 128 operates so that a certificate can only be issued by a judge in relation to evidence which falls outside s 128(8). That judgment is required to be made by the trial judge before the decision to issue the certificate is made and the relevant evidence is given. However, once the certificate has issued it will operate in accordance with its terms with the consequence that evidence falling within the certificate cannot “be used against the person” who has the benefit of the certificate. 
     
      
    82 Blackmore DCJ firstly indicated that he accepted Howie J’s reasoning to the effect that “a fact in issue in a criminal trial is a matter that is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to convict an accused.” His Honour indicates that he also agrees with Howie J that “it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that Cornwall was involved in the supply of drugs.” His Honour then continues saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “But that is hardly the end of the issue. Had the evidence been tendered for that purpose, namely to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused supplied drugs, it is unlikely that it would have been admitted at all. It was not necessary to prove that. What was necessary to prove was the element of the charge.” 
        
       
      
    83 His Honour then refers to the fact that the charge was one of conspiracy in which the element to be established is an agreement to carry out the illegal purpose involved. Because the illegal purpose in the case was the importation of a prohibited import his Honour concluded: “evidence that directly or indirectly established the existence of that agreement was evidence with respect to a fact in issue at the trial.” His Honour concluded that it would be open to the jury to find that the appellant was involved with the other alleged conspirators in the supply of drugs which would enable the jury to more easily conclude that the appellant was involved in an agreement to carry out the illegal purpose. His Honour determined that the jury could be satisfied on the balance of probabilities “as a piece of circumstantial evidence” that the appellant was involved with the others in the supply of drugs. If this was their conclusion his Honour found that the jury could reason that “given the nature of the relationship, the fact of actual association and their involvement with drugs, that the accused Cornwall would have entered into an agreement with Lawrence and others to carry out the illegal purpose.” 
     
      
    84 By this reasoning his Honour concluded that the conversations which had been recorded in which the appellant spoke about the supply of drugs with Lawrence and Diez was “evidence that went to a fact in issue in the trial, namely evidence that went to establish his involvement in the agreement between those alleged conspirators.” 
     
      
    85 Blackmore DCJ finally adverts to a difficulty which arose by reason of the way in which the matter was approached before Howie J. As I have already indicated Howie J was asked to consider whether or not a certificate should be issued after he had been made aware in a general sense of the evidence which the appellant proposed to give. The matter was not given consideration in light of an individual question to which objection was taken and a ruling made. In part this has given rise to the practical difficulties in this case. Although I doubt whether Howie J could have taken any other course the preferred course, where it is practical to do so, may be to make a ruling and issue a certificate which is expressed in relation to particular questions and answers. 
     
      
    86 Blackmore DCJ concludes his reasons in relation to the admission of the evidence by stating that he would admit it although the evidence was “technically being used against the accused.” Because his Honour was of the opinion that the appellant was not entitled to claim privilege in the first place he determined that the evidence should now be admitted. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of Ground One 
       
      
    87 The circumstances of the present case are unusual and I doubt whether they were foreseen by the draftsman of s 128. The more conventional circumstances where a witness, other than the accused, gives evidence but is protected from that evidence being tendered against him or her in the other proceedings is readily accommodated. However, I doubt whether the possibility of an accused giving evidence at his or her trial, issued a certificate, and later seeking to exclude his or her evidence at the first trial from being tendered at the retrial, relying upon the certificate, was contemplated. Furthermore, at a time when the argument first occurred before Howie J the possibility of a retrial was not in contemplation. 
     
      
    88 Whatever may have been the problems which the draftsman of s 128 had in mind, as I have already indicated, I am satisfied that the certificatae issued by Howie J operates to protect evidence given by the appellant at his first trial which is within the terms of the certificate. Although it was submitted by the Crown that this would be unfair to the prosecution it is not immediately obvious to me that this is so particularly when a trial is conducted under the adversarial system. The appellant gave evidence at his first trial after an evaluation was made of the Crown case against him. At the retrial the Crown is not confined to the evidence tendered at the first trial and any forensic decision in the prosecution case. If the prosecution is not confined it may be thought unfair if the accused was bound by the forensic decisions made at the first trial rendering him liable to have the evidence which he gave at the trial, which would otherwise be protected by a certificate, admitted into evidence. 
     
      
    89 Two issues were decided by Blackmore DCJ. Firstly his Honour found that “any proceeding” in s 128(7) extended to the retrial of the appellant. In my opinion his Honour’s conclusion on this matter was correct. The retrial proceeded upon a fresh indictment to the first trial, the co-accused named in the indictment being different to the co-accused at the first trial. The second trial was heard in the District Court whereas the first trial was held in the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    90 Apart from these matters the limitation on the use of the relevant evidence is expressed in very wide terms. The expression any proceeding “in a New South Wales court” would, unless otherwise qualified, extend to a proceeding by way of retrial with the possible exception of a retrial on the same indictment before the same court. 
     
      
    91 The second issue decided by Blackmore DCJ was the effective operation of the certificate. His Honour considered that question by determining the matters which in his Honour’s opinion could be protected by s 128(8). In doing so he did not consider the terms of the certificate itself except, in effect, to rule that the certificate had been issued contrary to the section. To my mind this was an error. 
     
      
    92 Section 128(8) provides that the section does not apply in relation to evidence falling within subs (a) or (b). Howie J considered that issue before determining to grant the certificate. I have previously referred to his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    93 At no time during the first trial was an application made to this Court seeking to challenge his Honour’s decision to grant a certificate or the terms of that certificate. The evidence was given with the knowledge that a certificate had been granted. In these circumstances Blackmore DCJ was required to determine the admissibility of the appellant’s evidence having regard to the terms of the certificate. 
     
      
    94 Approached in this manner very significant portions of the transcript have been tendered at the second trial contrary to the certificate. Containing as it did admissions that the appellant was engaged in domestic drug trafficking on a significant scale it could have significantly influenced the jury’s approach to the guilt or innocence of the appellant in respect of the matter charged. The Crown tendered the evidence “to use” it against the appellant at the retrial and in my opinion it was admitted contrary to s 128(7). 
     
      
       
      The Crown Appeal 
       
      
    95 After the certificate had been formerly issued by Howie J the Crown brought an appeal pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act ….. That subs provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.” 
        
       
      
    96 The appeal was originally listed before this Court without the appellant’s appeal. The Court determined that the Crown appeal should not be determined without consideration of the other matters and it was adjourned. 
     
      
    97 There are significant issues both as to whether a decision to issue a certificate is amenable to appeal and with respect to the relief, if any, which may be available when a certificate under s 128 has issued. Apprised of these difficulties the Crown sought to argue in this appeal that the relief which was sought was an order quashing the certificate. However, the proceedings have not been reconstituted and whether such an order could be made pursuant to s 5F(5) may be doubted. 
     
      
    98 The Parliament has provided s 5F so that questions with respect to rulings and orders during the course of a trial may be determined by this Court and orders made which ensure that the trial proceeds in accordance with interlocutory rulings made according to law. It is for this reason that the right of appeal is defined as an appeal against an interlocutory order. Once the trial has been concluded, although a question of law may be submitted to this Court for determination (s 5A), which may include questions arising in relation to interlocutory judgments or orders, this is confined to the circumstances where there has been an acquittal. 
     
      
    99 The position is made plain by the terms of subs (5) which indicates the relief which this Court may grant. As would be expected this Court may affirm or vacate the interlocutory order previously made or may make some other interlocutory order. There could be no purpose in granting such relief to the Crown when a trial has been concluded. 
     
      
    100 With respect to the suggestion that this Court might intervene to quash the certificate, it being submitted that the legal foundation for its issue did not exist, even if such relief was possible there are overwhelming discretionary reasons why I would decline to grant it. The appellant only gave evidence after Howie J had determined that a certificate would be granted. If that certificate could now be quashed, not only could the evidence be tendered at a retrial of the original charge but also would be available to the Crown to tender against him at a separate trial on the “domestic” charges. This could result in significant injustice. 
     
      
    101 In my opinion the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Grounds Four and Five 
       
      
    102 The prosecution case against the appellant was almost entirely dependant on the evidence provided by the recorded conversations. There were eight conversations of relevance to the case against the appellant recorded at the premises at Brougham Street, Woolloomoolloo between February and 20 April 2001. 
     
      
    103 The appellant’s case had two components. Firstly, it was argued that, there being no evidence of his involvement in any arrangement after 20 April, since no conversations were recorded after this, it cannot be concluded that the appellant was involved in the conspiracy in respect of which he was charged. His case was that although there may have been preliminary discussions about the importation of drugs, the appellant had a falling out with Diez, evidenced by heated exchanges between them about payments for domestic drug deals before any agreement to carry out the relevant importation was concluded.  
     
      
    104 Secondly, the case put by the appellant was that there was another importation in contemplation, referred to as a “second” or “parallel” importation which did not involve the appellant. Complaint is made that Blackmore DCJ did not refer to this suggested parallel importation in his remarks to the jury and expressly declined to give any directions in respect of it. 
     
      
    105 In relation to the second matter, there is evidence which could suggest that Diez was involved in deals apart from that particularised in relation to the appellant. The appellant points to unexplained references in the evidence of Diez going to New York and of his owing monetary obligations to persons already in Australia. The submission is that, as the alleged conspiracy involved drugs being exported from Columbia, the principals were unlikely to be in Australia. It is also suggested that there is conversation consistent with a “parallel importation” coming through the islands of Fiji and arriving in Australia before the Flaning. 
     
      
    106 Blackmore DCJ expressly declined to ask the jury to consider the suggested “parallel” importation. My present view is that his Honour was probably correct to do so. The evidence upon which the suggestion was founded was to my mind of minimal weight. However, having regard to the view I have expressed in relation to ground one it is unnecessary to resolve this issue and as a new trial is required the better course is to allow that matter, if it arises, to be determined again at that trial. 
     
      
    107 In relation to the first matter, which is captured in Ground five of the appeal there is evidence of a heated exchange between Diez and the appellant on 24 March in relation to the sale of drugs which were already in Australia. However, it does not follow that the jury could not be satisfied that the relevant agreement had not already been made. Furthermore, even if there was a disagreement about domestic matters it would not follow that the appellant did not maintain his role in the importation from Colombia. The lack of later listening device material may reflect even greater care to avoid detection than that which was previously in place. To my mind these were matters for the jury and it could not be said that there was no evidence to support the conviction. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    108 In Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81 the High Court again considered the proviso (s 61 of the Criminal Appeal Act). The occasion for its consideration was the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Victoria that a distinction should be drawn between an appellate court asking whether without the relevant error (in that case the wrongful admission of evidence) the jury at the appellant’s trial (“this jury”) would have convicted him and asking whether, without that evidence any reasonable jury, properly instructed, would inevitably have convicted him. The Victorian court concluded that the relevant test was the “this jury” test. 
     
      
    109 Consideration was given in the joint judgment of the High Court to the history of the proviso. Acknowledging that the statutory enactment was a rejection of the former Exchequer rule (where any and every departure from trial according to law required a new trial) the Court sought to identify the approach which should be taken by appellate courts when the proviso requires consideration. 
     
      
    110 The Court identified a number of relevant principles of which the following may be a useful summary: 
     
      
    · The appellate court must decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; [42] 
     
      
    · The task of the appellate court is an objective task and is to be carried out by consideration of the record of the trial; [42] 
     
      
    · the appellant court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence having regard to the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict; [43] 
     
      
    · it cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty; [44] 
     
      
    · there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded as to the requisite degree of the appellant’s guilt; [45] 
     
      
    111 In the present case it may be accepted that the appellant gave evidence at his first trial in an endeavour to explain the various conversations to which he was party as being conversations unrelated to the offence with which he was charged. Accordingly, it could be suggested that as the purpose of the evidence was merely exculpatory its admission at his second trial brought no disadvantage. In these circumstances, the Crown submits that as the evidence against the appellant is otherwise strong, the proviso should be applied. 
     
      
    112 The evidence which was admitted contrary to the certificate contained admissions of serious criminal activity relating to the sale and distribution of illegal drugs. It must have reflected unfavourably on the accused. Whether or not it was prudent of the appellant to give that evidence at his first trial, that jury, having had the chance to observe the appellant when he gave the evidence, were unable to convict him of the offence charged. The tender of the transcript of his evidence from the first trial at the second trial must have had significant impact on the attitude of the jury to the appellant who heard the evidence, knowing it had been given under oath in other proceedings, although they were not told the occasion on which it was given. The exculpatory benefit, if any, for which the evidence was given at the first trial may have been diminished by the fact that the jury at the second trial did not see the appellant give evidence and were accordingly denied an opportunity of assessing the weight to be given to it having regard to his demeanour. 
     
      
    113 I am satisfied that the approach taken by Blackmore DCJ caused the trial to miscarry. The appellant gave evidence at the first trial with the knowledge that his evidence would be protected by an appropriate certificate. However, the approach taken by Blackmore DCJ to the application of s 128 made it impossible for the appellant to give oral evidence at his second trial. His Honour would not have granted a certificate rendering his prosecution on the domestic charges possible, and if prosecuted, conviction almost certain.  
     
      
    114 Just as the High Court in Weiss at [43] said the conviction of the appellant was relevant when considering whether to apply the proviso the fact that the jury could not return a verdict at the first trial cannot be entirely ignored. The jury had a greater opportunity to assess the appellant’s credit at his first trial, which, although they had a transcript of the evidence, was denied to the jury at the second trial. 
     
      
    115 In these circumstances, although I am of the opinion that the Crown case was strong I would not apply the proviso. In my opinion the appeal should be upheld and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    116 HULME J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    117 ADAMS J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    118 Accordingly, the orders of the Court are: 
     
      
      1. The appeal of the appellant is upheld and a new trial ordered. 
       
      2. The Crown appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
      
    1 HOWIE J: On 31 October 2001 Ms Daisy Jones died. Her family wished her to be cremated. On 1 November 2001 Mr Errol Davidson died. His family wished him to be buried. On 5 November 2001 Mr Davidson was mistakenly cremated instead of Ms Jones. On 7 November 2001 Ms Jones was placed in Mr Davidson’s coffin and buried in the plot reserved for him. In order to disguise the difference in weight between Ms Jones and Mr Davidson, pavers or bricks were placed in the coffin with Ms Jones. 
     
      
    2 On 12 November Mr Ebbott, who worked for a funeral business known as Caring Funerals, told a representative of the Department of Health about the burial of Ms Jones. On 14 November Caring Funerals sent an account for $3,309.50, including crematorium fees to Ms Jones’ son who paid the account. On 19 November 2001 Caring Funerals sent an account for $6.585.00 to the widow of Mr Davidson for his funeral. The account was never paid because on 23 November 2001 the body of Ms Jones was exhumed. 
     
      
    3 Arising from these peculiar facts the first defendant, Mr Lee, the funeral director for Caring Funerals, was charged with two offences: obtaining money by deception in relation to the burial of Ms Jones and attempting to obtain money by deception in respect of the cremation of Mr Davidson. The allegation is that in each case Mr Lee knew that payment would be requested from the relatives notwithstanding that Mr Davidson had been cremated and Ms Jones had been buried contrary to the wishes of their respective families and with the intention of deceiving them as to the funeral services carried out on their behalf. 
     
      
       
      History of the proceedings 
      
    4 The matter came before the second defendant, a magistrate, on 11 September 2002. Without hearing evidence she dismissed the informations on the basis that the prosecution could not prove either offence. 
     
      
    5 The Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) then sought to have the Magistrate’s orders quashed in this Court on the basis that she had no power to dismiss the informations without hearing evidence and deciding disputed issues of fact. The DPP succeeded and on 8 July 2003, James J quashed the orders discharging Mr Lee and remitted the matter to the Local Court: DPP v Lee [2003] NSWSC 612. His Honour ordered that the proceedings should be heard afresh by another magistrate. 
     
      
    6 Mr Lee appealed to the Court of Appeal against the orders made by James J. On 9 June 2004 the appeal was dismissed save in respect of the direction that a different magistrate hear the matter: Lee v DPP [2004] NSWCCA 172. The Court held that James J did not have power under the provisions in force at the time of his decision to make that order, that is s 109 of the Justices Act 1902 (now repealed). The matter had to be remitted to the magistrate who had made the orders that were quashed. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly the matter came before the Magistrate on 14 December 2004 and evidence was taken. The matter was not concluded on that date and it was adjourned to 14 April 2005 for further hearing of evidence. Submissions were made to the Magistrate at the close of the prosecution case. The Magistrate reserved on the matter and delivered judgment on 29 April 2005 dismissing the informations for substantially the same reasons that she originally dismissed them in September 2002. 
     
      
       
      Present proceedings 
      
    8 By Summons filed on 10 August 2005 the DPP seeks an order pursuant to s 59(1) of the Crimes (Local Court Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the orders of the Magistrate dismissing the informations. In addition the DPP seeks three declarations as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        2. A declaration that the Magistrate erred in law in that she failed to have regard to uncontested evidence which made out the elements of the offence. 
         
         
        3. A declaration that the Magistrate erred in law in that she failed to apply the applicable principles of law to the facts established by the evidence. 
         
         
        4. In the alternative, a declaration that the Magistrate failed to exercise her jurisdiction property in that she took irrelevant/extraneous considerations into account in arriving at her determination. 
        
       
      
    9 The DPP also seeks a remittal to the Local Court and a fresh hearing before a different magistrate. 
     
      
    10 On behalf of Mr Lee a Notice of Motion was filed on 4 October 2005. It sought the following orders: that the proceedings brought by the DPP be struck out; alternatively that the proceedings be permanently stayed; alternatively that the proceedings be transferred to the Court of Criminal Appeal; that costs be awarded to Mr Lee; that punitive damages be awarded to Mr Lee. At the hearing Mr Lee was represented by Mr Bonnici of counsel. He advised the Court that he did not wish to proceed on the Notice of Motion at the outset of the hearing, but rather he would ask the Court to dismiss the proceedings brought by the DPP either because they had no merit or because it would be unjust to continue the prosecution by remitting the matter for further hearing having regard to the history of the matter and the nature of the charges. 
     
      
    11 The DPP accepted that the proceedings were brought pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Local Court Appeal and Review) Act and it was therefore necessary for it to show that there had been an error of law committed by the Magistrate in dismissing the information. It was submitted that the error, or errors, of law would be found in the reasons given by the Magistrate. It should be noted that the Magistrate reserved before giving reasons and so more rigour might be expected by her in determining the facts and issues raised at the hearing than in a case where an ex tempore judgment was given at the end of the proceedings. 
     
      
    12 The informations each alleged an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. That section is relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Obtaining money etc by deception 
         
         
        (1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        (2) In subsection (1):  
         
          
          “deception” means deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including:  
           
            
            (a) a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or of any other person, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    13 The first information alleged that: 
     
      
       
        
        Adam James Lee on the 19th of November 2001, at Five 
          
        Dock, in the State of New South Wales, did attempt to dishonestly obtaining for himself as the Managing Director of Caring Funerals money to wit, $6,595 by deception, namely billing Rose Davidson for funeral and burial services to the late Errol Davidson which were not properly rendered. 
        
       
      
    14 The second information alleged that: 
     
      
       
        
        Adam James Lee on the 14th day of November 2001, at Five 
          
        Dock, in the State of New South Wales, did dishonestly obtaining for himself as Managing Director of Caring Funerals a valuable thing to wit, a NSW Teachers Credit Union Cheque to the amount of $3309.50, by deception, namely accepting payment from William Jones regarding funeral and cremation services for the late Daisy Jones which were not properly rendered. 
        
       
      
    15 Much of the argument that has taken place both in the Local Court and in this Court has been concerned with the nature of the charges and the particulars of what is alleged to be the deceptive conduct. Mr Lee argues that the evidence relied on by the prosecution taken at its highest cannot prove the deceptive conduct alleged or that the conduct could have induced the payment of money. 
     
      
       
      Prosecution evidence 
      
    16 The evidence in the prosecution case is relatively straightforward and in a short compass. There is no dispute between the parties that Mr Davidson was cremated in place of Ms Jones or that Ms Jones was buried in Mr Davidson’s coffin. Nor is it disputed that the relatives were billed for the amounts set out in the charges on account of funeral services performed by Mr Lee’s business on their behalf. What is in dispute is when it was that Mr Lee first learned of the fact that Mr Davidson had been cremated and Ms Jones buried in his coffin. The prosecution allege that he knew at least by 8 November when he had a conversation with Mr Ebbott. Mr Lee maintains that it was not until 12 November, when a representative of the Department of Health informed him of the fact. 
     
      
    17 The principal prosecution witness was Mr Ebbott who was employed as an undertaker with Caring Funerals. Mr Ebbott gave evidence that he spoke to Mrs Davidson about the funeral arrangements for her husband and she said she wanted him buried. The funeral was to be on Wednesday 7 November. On the day before, Mr Ebbott was asked by Mr Lee to help put a body into a coffin. He noticed that it was Mr Davidson’s coffin that was being used. He assisted Mr Lee to place the body, which was in a body bag, into the coffin. Mr Lee told him that there was a mistake made on the Monday and that Mr Davidson had been cremated instead of Ms Jones. Mr Lee said that they were placing the body of Ms Jones into Mr Davidson’s coffin. He said he was relieved that the Davidson family had not asked for a viewing and told Mr Ebbott to keep quiet about it. 
     
      
    18 Mr Ebbott gave evidence that he saw Mr Lee pickup a paver and put it into Mr Davidson’s coffin. Mr Lee also placed a bottle with water into the coffin. Mr Ebbott went home but was confused about whether he should speak to the Davidson family about what he had seen. He decided not to do so. He attended what was supposed to be the funeral of Mr Davidson the next day. 
     
      
    19 After the funeral, back at the workshop area of Caring Funerals, Mr Ebbott spoke to Mr Lee and expressed his concern at what had happened. He said that he had been unable to sleep because of it. He wanted Mr Lee to tell the families what had happen or, if he did not want to do so, he would tell them. Mr Lee replied that he should not say anything because “it could hurt his business”. Mr Lee pleaded with Mr Ebbott not to say anything to anyone about the matter. 
     
      
    20 The next day Mr Ebbott resigned. He then contacted a person in the Department of Health, as he was advised to do by a person to whom he had spoken at the Australian Funeral Directors Association. As a result of what he was told, Mr Ebbott made two statutory declarations and sent one to the Department of Health and one to the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. 
     
      
    21 Mr Jones, the son of Ms Jones, gave evidence and his statement was tendered before the Magistrate. On 30 October fearing that his mother was seriously ill, he attended Caring Funerals and spoke to a person there named Grace. He indicated to her that he wanted his mother to be cremated. His mother died the next day. On 2 November he went to Caring Funerals to select the floral arrangement for the coffin. Later that day he received a phone call from Ms Tancred at Caring Funerals who confirmed the time and place of the funeral, being 2.30pm at Rookwood Crematorium. The funeral service took place on 5 November and Mr Lee was present. Mr Jones paid the account sent by Caring Funerals on 15 November 2001 with a credit union cheque. 
     
      
    22 Mr Jones received a phone call from Mr Lee on 23 November 2001 apologising for what had happened and offering to refund the monies paid. He also asked whether he should go ahead with the cremation. Later that evening Mr Lee attended at Mr Jones’ home and spoke to his wife. They refused to accept the refund. Mr Lee asked whether they still wanted a cremation and they said that they did. The statement of Mr Jones contains the following; “I paid and instructed Caring Funerals to cremate my mother on 5 November 2001”. 
     
      
    23 Mr Jones gave evidence and was somewhat confused about dates, but it is clear that he paid the cheque to Caring Funerals on the basis that his mother had been cremated “as per instructions”. Mr Jones was not cross-examined. There was also in evidence a “memorandum of fees” from Caring Funerals dated 14 November. The document refers to Ms Jones and states that the Funeral Services were conducted on 5 November 2001. Although the services conducted are not specified, in the disbursements “paid on your behalf” was a sum of $706 for Crematorium fees. 
     
      
    24 Ms Davidson, Mr Davidson’s widow, gave evidence and her statement was tendered at the hearing before the Magistrate. Mr Ebbott came to her daughter’s house on 2 November to discuss her husband’s funeral. They decided on a burial and chose the casket and flowers. She believed she signed a contract with Caring Funerals for the burial. She agreed with Mr Ebbott that the funeral was to commence at 10.30am on 7 November and the burial was to take place at the Forrest Lawn Cemetery. On 5 November she spoke to Mr Lee about the clothes in which her husband was to be buried. The next day she took the clothing to Caring Funerals. While there she asked the employee at the reception desk whether Mr Lee could drive the hearse down her street on the way to the cemetery. The employee spoke to someone on a phone and then said, “That was Adam and he said that was quite alright”. 
     
      
    25 The next day, the hearse was driven past her home on the way to the cemetery. Mr Lee was present at the funeral and at her request placed a photo of Mr Davidson on the coffin. 
     
      
    26 Ms Davidson received a bill for the funeral expenses on 19 November 2001. She later was told by a representative from the Department of Health of Mr Ebbott’s statutory declaration. On 21 November Mr Lee attended at her home and told her she would not have to pay the account. Ms Davidson signed a consent for the exhumation. Mr Lee told her, “Be prepared for the worst”. 
     
      
    27 Ms Davidson was asked whether she had a contract for her husband’s funeral. She said that she did not as she had mislaid it. She said that Mr Lee asked her to return to him the account she had received on 19 November. Ms Davidson was not cross-examined. 
     
      
    28 Mr Lee made a record of interview with police. He denied the allegations made by Mr Ebbott as to his knowledge that Ms Jones was buried in Mr Davidson’s coffin or that he refused to let the families know what had happened. 
     
      
       
      Submissions to the Magistrate 
      
    29 At the end of the prosecution case Mr Bonnici on behalf of Mr Lee made submissions to the Magistrate. These submissions comprehended both a no case submission and a submission that the Magistrate should have a reasonable doubt on the evidence adduced in the prosecution case, sometimes referred to as a “May v O’Sullivan submission”. In my opinion it is not appropriate to make submissions in this way combining two distinct and different bases upon which a magistrate may dismiss a criminal charge without the defendant giving evidence. The reason is that a determination that there is no case to answer involves a question of law whereas a determination of guilt is a question of fact. In Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden (2001) 122 A Crim R 166 at [37] –[50] the following passage in Cox v Salt (1994) 12 WAR 12 at 14 was approved: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………..the determination of a no case to answer submission at the close of a prosecution’s case is a question of law, whereas the determination of the ultimate question of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is a question of fact. Although in the exercise of her functions the magistrate is required to determine both questions of law and fact, this cannot destroy the essential separability of these questions. 
         
         
        Subject to certain exceptions, when adjudicating upon the evidence whether a defendant could lawfully be convicted, the magistrate is required to proceed on the assumption that all the evidence of primary facts, considered at its strongest from the point of view of the case for the prosecution, is accurate: See R v Bilick & Starke (1984) 36 SASR 321 at 337; Myers v Claudianos (1990) 100 FLR 362 at 369. The exceptions are evidence that is inherently incredible (Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] AC 136 at 151; [1981] 3 WLR 395 at 403) or manifestly self-contradictory or the product of a disorderly mind: see R v Bilick & Starke at 337. 
         
         
        Where the prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence, the magistrate is required to take into account all inferences most favourable to the prosecution which could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts: (See Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor (at 150); Myers v Claudianos (at 369).” 
         
        
       
      
    30 The prosecutor raised this issue with the Magistrate at the outset of his submissions in the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Thomas 
        : Your Honour, just initially I note that that appeared to be both a submission that there was no prima facie case as well as a May v O'Sullivan submission which is most unusual in my submission, to do both. 
         
         
        Her honour 
        : I guess I heard those in the alternative rather than as one. Mr Bonnici made several submissions about the evidence of Mr Ebbott and basically what he was saying towards the end was that if you accept Ebbott’s case or, rather, if one accepts Ebbott’s evidence then consider the May v O'Sullivan situation. 
         
         
        Thomas 
        : Yes, it seemed as though, yes, the prima facie submission was in effect subsumed ultimately by the May v O'Sullivan submission. 
         
         
        Her honour 
        : That's right, absolutely. 
        
       
      
    31 Quite frankly I simply do not understand the first quoted response by the Magistrate which seems to confuse the two issues raised with her by Mr Lee's counsel. In order to determine whether there was a prima facie case the Magistrate was required to consider that question on the basis that she accepted the evidence of Mr Ebbott and every other prosecution witness taken at its highest. It was only once a prima facie case had been found that the Magistrate turned to consider whether or not to accept the evidence of any prosecution witness beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    32 Keeping the two issues separate and distinct is no mere empty formality. And it is of crucial importance for the present proceedings. If the Magistrate determined to dismiss the informations before her on the basis that the prosecution evidence, even if accepted beyond reasonable doubt, could not prove all the elements of the charges, it is then open to the DPP to argue that her decision was erroneous in law. On the other hand if she determined to dismiss the informations because she did not accept some part of the prosecution’s evidence on a crucial issue beyond reasonable doubt, it would be difficult for the DPP to identify any question of law that would give this Court jurisdiction to intervene. 
     
      
    33 Unfortunately because the two issues were argued together and addressed by the Magistrate in the one judgment, much of the argument before this Court was concerned to identify the basis upon which the Magistrate determined to dismiss the charges. Nowhere does the Magistrate in her reasons make clear whether she is determining that there is no prima facie case or whether she has rejected the evidence given by Mr Ebbott, Ms Davidson or Mr Jones. This is more than regrettable given the history of this matter and the fact that the Magistrate reserved to consider the submissions. Very often this Court will be required to take into account and make allowances for looseness of expression or confusion of thought apparent in a judgment of a magistrate or judge because the reasons for a determination were given ex tempore at the conclusion of the hearing. But it is less easy to be forgiving where, as here, the magistrate reserved and apparently prepared the judgment with the aid of a transcript before giving it. 
     
      
    34 As the prosecutor put to the Magistrate, this was a straightforward case with a single issue: was Mr Ebbott to be believed beyond reasonable doubt? If he was, then I fail to understand how his evidence did not prove the charges. If he was not, then the prosecution had to fail on both charges. Yet the Magistrate does not appear to have addressed this question. It seems to me, with respect, that the Magistrate did not comprehend the real basis of the prosecution case or the significance of the evidence before her. And this was not the fault of the prosecutor. 
     
      
       
      The Magistrate’s reasons 
      
    35 After giving a summary of the evidence in the prosecution case, the Magistrate said the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Court is required to consider all of the evidence before it, the only relevant evidence being as indicated, that of Mr Ebbott and the Court accepts his evidence as far as it goes. However there are significant deficiencies in that evidence in terms of proving the charges against the accused. 
        
       
       
      There was considerable controversy before me as to what the Magistrate was meaning to convey by this passage. The DPP submitted that it was clear that the Magistrate was undertaking the task of determining whether there was a prima facie case; that is she decided the issue by accepting the evidence of Mr Ebbott but found that it failed to prove all the elements of the offence. On the other hand Mr Bonnici submitted that the Magistrate was indicating that she did not accept the evidence of Mr Ebbott because of deficiencies in his evidence. 
       
      
    36 Of course this passage has to be taken in context and the next three paragraphs of her judgment might illuminate what it was that the Magistrate was deciding. She went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The defence cross examination of Mr Ebbott proceeded on the basis that the switching of the bodies could have been done by the witness, Mr Ebbott, but the Court takes the view that there is no evidence before the Court which in any way assists in determining how it was that the wrong body, that of Mr Davidson, was cremated on Monday 5 November 2001. In fact there is no evidence which suggests that the bodies were switched. 
         
         
        Even accepting without question Mr Ebbott’s evidence that on Tuesday 6 November 2001 the accused informed him that Mr Davidson had been cremated by mistake, to use Mr Ebbott’s words, on the previous day and the Court can be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused had some knowledge as at that date but there is no evidence, firstly, that a person or persons deliberately took one body and replaced it with another and, secondly, that the present accused was the person who carried out such action. 
         
         
        Regarding the second of those propositions force is added to that view by reason of Mr Ebbott’s evidence that the accused very rarely engaged in mortuary duties and the preparation of bodies and, of course, as I have just commented, the complete lack of any evidence of the present accused having been involved in any sort of switching of bodies on Monday 5 November or, rather I should say, I beg your pardon, on Friday 2 November, the Friday prior. For that matter there is no evidence before the Court from which it might be inferred in any way that Mr Ebbott switch the bodies, as was suggested in defence submissions. 
        
       
      
    37 The second paragraph seems to indicate to me that the Magistrate is in the course of determining whether there was a prima facie case. The use of the phrase “even accepting without question Mr Ebbott’s evidence” is consistent with the approach a court is to take in determining whether there is a prima facie case by accepting the prosecution’s evidence at it’s highest, that is without questioning it’s reliability. Similarly the Magistrate’s rejection of the defence attack on Mr Ebbott, that he was responsible for the error in the cremation of Mr Davidson, seems to suggest that the Magistrate is making no adverse finding about the evidence of Mr Ebbott as the defence asked her to do. 
     
      
    38 I do not understand the Magistrate’s reference to “the balance of probabilities” in the second quoted paragraph above. Mr Bonnici submitted that it indicated that the Magistrate was not satisfied of the evidence of Mr Ebbott beyond reasonable doubt, but if that is what she meant she should have said so. It seems to me rather that the Magistrate was accepting the evidence of Mr Lee’s knowledge of the cremation of Mr Davidson for the purpose of considering whether the evidence could prove the charges at a prima facie level. 
     
      
       
        
        The act of deception 
        
       
      
    39 However the Magistrate is, in my respectful opinion, in this part of her judgment addressing a completely irrelevant question: who was responsible for switching the bodies? As the Magistrate correctly noted, there was no evidence as to how it was Mr Davidson came to be cremated. But the prosecution was not alleging that Mr Lee was responsible for that unfortunate state of affairs and certainly was not suggesting that Mr Lee or anyone else did it deliberately. True it is that the prosecutor did refer at the start of his address to “a cover up, a switching of corpses” in a completely inappropriate reference to a comic character on a television programme and, on occasions during his address referred to the switching of bodies, as a form of short hand. But it is clear beyond argument that the prosecution case was that Mr Lee, having learned of the cremation of Mr Davidson’s body, determined to place Ms Jones in Mr Davidson’s coffin and say nothing to the relatives. That was the “cover up” which the prosecutor submitted was at the crux of the prosecution case and in respect of which Mr Ebbott’s evidence was vital. 
     
      
    40 The only relevance of the defence suggestion that Mr Ebbott was responsible for the cremation of Mr Davidson was to raise the allegation that he was lying in his evidence about Mr Lee’s conduct in placing Ms Jones in Mr Davidson’s coffin to cover up Mr Ebbott’s own negligence. It was an attack upon his credit. The defence did not have to prove Mr Ebbott was responsible any more than the prosecution had to prove that Mr Lee was. Yet this non-issue became a substantial part of the Magistrate’s judgment. If this was one of the deficiencies that she saw in the prosecution case arising from Mr Ebbott’s evidence, then clearly she was in error. 
     
      
    41 Earlier in her judgment this passage occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is contended by the Crown that the switching of the bodies - to use the expression employed by Mr Thomas in submissions to the Court - constitutes a cover up, as he said, the dishonesty or deception necessary to complete the offence. Indeed, the term ""switched"" necessarily implies a deceit meaning, as per the Oxford English Dictionary, ""to exchange items especially with intent to deceive"". 
         
         
        As to the switching of the bodies the Crown case is predicated on the evidence of Mr Robin Ebbott. It was further submitted that the accused knowing that the bodies had been switched issued the bills the payment of the funeral services. 
        
       
      
    42 With respect, the Magistrate was placing far too much emphasis on the use by the prosecutor of the phrase “the switching” of corpses or bodies in the prosecutor’s address to convert that into an element of the prosecution’s case such that, if it were not proved that Mr Lee switched the bodies, the prosecution must fail. It was an infelicitous phrase used by the prosecutor, but it was said in the context of the term “cover up” which is what the prosecution was alleging that Mr Lee had done by placing the body of Ms Jones in the coffin of Mr Davidson and by not disclosing that fact to the relatives of both deceased. In my opinion the true nature of the prosecution case could not have been plainer. 
     
      
    43 Yet the Magistrate continues in her judgment to discuss the lack of evidence as to the work practices at Mr Lee’s business as if this were a deficiency in the case because the prosecution could not negative the Magistrate’s finding that “it might well be possible to unwittingly mistake one body for another absent a view or some documentary identification attached to it”. Whether that was a possibility or not was again simply irrelevant to any issue that was before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    44 The Magistrate then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When the knowledge of the accused is relevant knowledge in terms of the prosecution proving its case beyond reasonable doubt is quite another matter (sic). The state of the evidence about that is such that no necessary or reasonable inference inconsistent with innocence can be drawn. Is not the switching of the bodies per se which is under consideration in this case, rather it is whether by such deception the accused was unjustly or unlawfully enriched or, to put it in the terms of the legislation, obtained a financial benefit therefrom. It is an essential ingredient of the offence that the cause of the payment of the money was a deception used by the accused and I note very strongly at this point that the prosecution case in fact was presented on the basis of the switching of the bodies as leading to the deception. 
        
       
      
    45 Again this passage shows that the Magistrate completely misconceived the prosecution case. The relevant issue was not whether Mr Lee knew that the bodies were switched, but whether he knew at the relevant time, that is before the accounts were sent to the families, that Mr Davidson had been cremated and that Ms Jones was buried in his place. The prosecution case based upon the evidence of Mr Ebbott was clear that he did. It was not a circumstantial case at all and the Magistrate’s reference to “a reasonable inference inconsistent with innocence” in that passage shows how far the Magistrate had wandered from the real issue in the case. 
     
      
    46 The Magistrate, however, was correct when she stated that “it is not the switching of the bodies per se which is under consideration in this case” but that the issue was whether by his conduct Mr Lee had deceived Ms Davidson and Mr Jones. However she misunderstood the nature of the deceptive conduct being relied upon by the prosecution. It was that Mr Lee allowed the accounts for the funeral services to be sent to those persons knowing that they would pay them unaware of the true situation, being that Mr Davidson had not been buried and that Ms Jones had not been cremated. If Mr Ebbott were believed, then it was part of Mr Lee’s cover-up that the accounts were to be sent because the families were not to know the truth. To hold back the accounts, might put the families on notice that something was amiss. The cover-up required the families to be deceived into paying the accounts on the basis that their wishes had been carried out. 
     
      
    47 The prosecution case was that the motive for the deception was to cover-up the fact that an error had been made rather than simply to obtain the payment of money to which Mr Lee knew he was not entitled, but the motive with which a person acts in obtaining property by deception is relevant only to the question of dishonesty. It has never been suggested that if Mr Lee did what the prosecution alleged that he acted other than dishonestly. 
     
      
    48 It was plain that the prosecution case was that, if Mr Ebbott were believed beyond reasonable doubt, the offence was proved insofar as the deceptive conduct on the part of Mr Lee was proved. In my opinion the prosecution was correct in that contention. Yet the Magistrate clearly did not understand that this was how the case was being run before her. The failure on the part of the Magistrate to appreciate what the case was about was not the fault of the prosecutor who made it perfectly clear in his address. The Magistrate’s fixation on the allegation of switching the bodies simply led her to misunderstand the true nature of the prosecution case. 
     
      
       
      Were Ms Davidson or Mr Jones deceived? 
      
    49 The Magistrate then turned to consider the question of whether the relatives of the deceased were induced to hand over money or the cheque by the invoices sent out by Caring Funerals. She begins this part of her judgment with the phrase “accepting for the purposes of the argument that there was a switching of the bodies”. This clearly indicates to my mind that the Magistrate was determining this next issue on a prima facie level and not on the basis of any assessment of the reliability of the evidence of Mr Ebbott or any of the other prosecution witnesses. 
     
      
    50 Of course this element did not have to be proved in the charge involving Ms Davidson because that charge alleged an attempt. The offence was made out once the prosecution proved deceptive conduct on the part of Mr Lee with the intention of inducing Ms Davidson to part with the money. 
     
      
    51 As to the element of inducement the Magistrate said:  
     
      
       
        
         
        Accepting for the purposes of the argument that there was a switching of the bodies the evidence must then be capable of satisfying the court beyond reasonable doubt that the families were somehow induced to hand over the monies claimed by way of the tax invoices issued by the accused and there is no such evidence and nor can such an inference be drawn, rather the families were concerned to attend to the funeral services of the deceased members and thus to be taken to have expected to pay costs commensurate with the funeral services being conducted. There is no suggestion in those circumstances that they were somehow defrauded, cheated, swindled of their money or otherwise imposed upon to part with it and that is the gravamen of the offence not, as the Crown erroneously put to the Court, that the Jones family expecting a burial of their deceased did not get a burial and likewise the Davidson family did not get the cremation of the deceased family member that they expected. 
         
         
        That submission entirely misconceives what is an issue in these proceedings, that is, as it was presented by the prosecution. However, if in fact the prosecution case relies on any contract that might have been on foot which specified particular funeral services in each case then failure to perform in accordance with the agreed terms of the contract gives rise simpliciter to civil action but if this Court would make any findings in respect of such a contract then it would be necessary that the terms of the contract be proved and in this case given that it might be suggested - and the Court is simply speculating here because this was not part of the prosecution case - that some deception attached to either the issuance of the tax invoices or to the terms of the contract or to any representations that would have been made by the present accused to either or both the families then those matters would have to be prove beyond reasonable doubt and the Court would have to be informed through the presentation of appropriate relevant and admissible evidence as to the relative importance of the terms of the contract and in respect of any such contract the only other evidence which the Court has - and my earlier comments were that the only relevant evidence was that of Mr Ebbott - is the statement of Mrs Rose Davidson who told the Court through her statement given to police at the time in para 4: 
         
         
         ""After my husband passed away I made inquiries as to the funeral directors who organised the funeral of my friend's husband and I discovered it was done by Caring Funerals"". 
        
       
      
    52 The Magistrate then quoted a number of paragraphs from Ms Davidson's statement in relation to the arrangements made for the funeral of her husband with Mr Ebbott that were summarised earlier in this judgment. The Magistrate then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now, in relation to that evidence it has to be said, firstly, that whatever were the terms of any agreement between these parties it is not clear that there was a specific term of a specific contract entered into in regard to the actual funeral arrangements. 
         
         
        I commented on the last occasion that this matter was before the Court that the only reference to funeral services that I could find in any legislation that I have sought to research in relation to this matter was contained in the Funeral Fund Act and funeral services relates to both cremation and burial. 
        
       
      
    53 The Magistrate then went on to comment on the account given by Ms Davidson of the arrangements made with Mr Ebbott for the burial of her husband. The Magistrate noted that there were other persons present at that time and held the use of the pronoun ""we"" in that part of her statement where Ms Davidson said that Mr Ebbott came to her daughter’s house and “we all sat in the dining room and discussed funeral arrangements including flowers, caskets, whether we wanted burial or cremation…” did not necessarily include Mr Ebbott. Therefore the Magistrate held that there was very little in the evidence that could assist the court as to the actual terms of any contract and in particular as to any specific representations that Mr Ebbott might have made. 
     
      
    54 Again it should be noted that the Magistrate is clearly dealing with this issue on the basis of whether the evidence in the prosecution case, if accepted at its highest, proved the elements of the offences charged. She was not assessing the evidence on the basis of the reliability of any witness. It will be recalled that there was no contest over the evidence of Ms Davidson or Mr Jones. They were never cross-examined. 
     
      
    55 With respect to the Magistrate, the passages quoted above are inconsistent with the evidence and, in my opinion, offend against both commonsense and human experience. I find it extraordinary that the Magistrate could suggest that a person would enter into a contract with a funeral company for funeral services without there being any agreement between the company and the client as to the manner in which the body was to be disposed. The success of the prosecution did not depend upon a definition of “funeral services” found in some piece of legislation that had no relevance to the proceedings. It depended upon what was agreed between Mr Lee’s company and the client regardless of whether that agreement was in writing or not. There was never any suggestion that Mr Lee was not intending to have Mr Davidson buried or Ms Jones cremated according to the familys’ wishes and in accordance with what they had agreed to pay for the funeral services. The problem arose because his intentions were thwarted by the accidental cremation of Mr Davidson. 
     
      
    56 It is abundantly clear from the evidence that Ms Davidson wished to have her husband buried and Mr Lee purported to act accordingly. Hence Mr Lee agreed to drive the hearse past her home on the way to the cemetery. It was because Mr Davidson had not been buried as arranged that Mr Lee apologised to her and refused to take payment for the services. The suggestion by the Magistrate that Mr Ebbott might not have been part of the conversation with Ms Davidson and the family as to the burial arrangements for her husband, even at a prima facie level, flies in the face of a sensible reading of her statement and the absence of any cross-examination of Mr Ebbott or Ms Davidson to the contrary. In my view the Magistrate’s findings in this regard are perverse. 
     
      
    57 Similarly there was never the slightest suggestion that Mr Jones had not entered into an agreement with Caring Funerals that his mother be cremated. The absence of a contract in writing to that effect was not fatal to the prosecution case and certainly not at a prima facie level. Again Mr Jones evidence was unchallenged. The uncontradicted evidence was that Mr Lee apologised to Mr Jones and asked whether he still wished the cremation to proceed. He also offered to return the payment made. It was clear beyond argument that it was a condition of the agreement entered into between Caring Funerals and Mr Jones that his mother was to be cremated. 
     
      
    58 Further, in respect of the charge relating to Ms Jones there was in evidence the account rendered to her son by Caring Funerals. In respect of that piece of evidence the Magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The only further evidence that has been provided to the Court is a memorandum of fees under the letterhead of Caring Funerals Pty Limited and this is a document relating to the furnishing and conducting of funeral services of the late Daisy Jane Jones and I have already made my comments with respect to the meaning of those terms. Once again, it has to be said that that evidence is of very little assistance to the Court. 
        
       
      
    59 In fact the document was false on its face for two reasons. Firstly it gives the date of the funeral as 5 November when in fact the funeral of Ms Jones did not occur until 7 November when she was buried in the grave of Mr Davidson. Secondly, it contains in the disbursements a crematorium fee that was never paid in respect of Ms Jones because she was not cremated. If Mr Lee knew that document was false, it could not have been sent for any reason other than to induce Mr Jones to pay for the cremation of his mother. It was never suggested that Mr Jones did not pay with a cheque to Caring Funerals as a result of receiving that document and believing it to be true. The only issue was whether Mr Lee knew that the document would be sent and intended that it would deceive Mr Jones into believing that his mother had been cremated in accordance with the agreement reached between him and Caring Funerals. If Mr Ebbott’s evidence was believed to the effect that Mr Lee was covering up the fact that Mr Davidson had been cremated so that the relatives would not know, then a magistrate could infer that Mr Lee must have known and intended that the false accounts would be sent and, therefore, intended to deceive Mr Jones into paying for his mother’s cremation that had never taken place. 
     
      
    60 Similarly there was no suggestion that an account had not been sent to Ms Davidson for the burial of her husband. Although there was no evidence of what it said, it could be inferred that it was false as to the date of his funeral and as to the costs incurred, as they would have been based upon a burial on 7 November and not a cremation on 5 November. If Mr Ebbott’s evidence was believed, then it was open to a magistrate to infer that Mr Lee intended that the accounts would be sent out as part of the cover-up with the intention that Ms Davidson would be deceived into paying the account on the basis that her husband had been buried according to the agreement she had entered into with Caring Funerals. 
     
      
       
      The Magistrate erred in dismissing the informations 
      
    61 The Magistrate concluded her judgment with the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As I was saying, any such contracts have not been formally proved in these proceedings notwithstanding the evidence of Mr Davidson's widow as I have just referred to it and that of Mrs Jones’ son. If the prosecution were to rely on any such contracts to then prove the causal link between the switching of the bodies and the claim for monies, it would also have to prove beyond reasonable doubt what representations were made by the accused person to the respective families at the time when the tax invoices were furnished and there is no evidence whatsoever of that but in any event, as already indicated, there is no evidence of the bodies being switched in the sense of being exchanged with intention to deceive, let alone that the accused did such an act, much less that such deception was the cause of any payment to him. 
        
       
      
    62 It should be obvious by now that in my opinion this paragraph shows that the Magistrate had completely misconceived the prosecution case notwithstanding that it was relatively simple and straightforward. The prosecution did not have to prove that Mr Lee switched the bodies. That was not the deception relied upon. There was ample and uncontested evidence that there was an agreement between Mr Lee’s company and the relatives that the funeral arrangements would take a specific form, burial in the case of Mr Davidson and cremation in the case of Ms Jones. There was no dispute that the relatives were not induced to make payment by the invoice sent, or that the invoices were not false and deceptive. The only real issue was whether Mr Lee had acted to cover up the mistaken cremation of Mr Davidson by burying Ms Jones in his grave so that the relatives would not know what had happened. If he did, then it might be inferred that Mr Lee must have known and intended that the deceptive invoices would be sent as part of that cover-up and it was done with the intention of deceiving the relatives. 
     
      
    63 In my opinion the Magistrate made in effect the same error that she made when dismissing the informations without a hearing when the matter was first before her. This shows the wisdom of the order made by James J that the matter not be returned to her, even though that order could not be made having regard to the wording of the provision under which James J was given jurisdiction to quash the orders. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion the prosecution had to prove the following: (a) that Mr Lee knew that Mr Davidson had been cremated; (b) that he sought to cover up that situation by having Ms Jones buried in his stead; (c) that as part of the cover-up he knew and intended that accounts would be sent to Mr Jones and Ms Davidson that were deceptive in that they represented that the funeral arrangements had been carried out in accordance with the agreement that Ms Jones be cremated and Mr Davidson buried; (d) that he intended that the recipients of those accounts would be induced by those representations to pay the accounts; (e) that Mr Jones was induced to do so; and (f) as a result of that inducement Mr Lee received or attempted to receive payment. Although it was also necessary for the prosecution to prove that Mr Lee acted dishonestly, if the other elements were proved there was no question but that his actions were dishonest by the current standards of ordinary honest persons: see R v Love (1989) 17 NSWLR 608 at 614. 
     
      
    65 In my opinion the only parts of the prosecution case that were seriously in question were (a) to (d) above and, if Mr Ebbott’s evidence were believed beyond reasonable doubt, those elements could be proved by inference. This is no doubt why the prosecutor told the magistrate that the case was predicated on Mr Ebbott. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion the Magistrate determined that there was no prima facie case on the evidence led by the prosecution and in that finding she made a number of errors of law. The only question is what orders if any this Court should make based upon that finding. 
     
      
       
      What orders to make? 
      
    67 The Court’s powers to make orders consequent upon an appeal under s 56(1)(c) are set out in s 59 which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        59 Determination of appeals  
         
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against sentence:  
         
          
          (a) by setting aside the sentence, or  
           
          (b) by varying the sentence, or  
           
          (c) by dismissing the appeal.  
          
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in section 56 (1) (b), (c) or (d) or 57 (1) (b) or (c):  
         
          
          (a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or  
           
          (b) by dismissing the appeal. 
          
         
        
       
      
    68 The DPP have asked me to set aside the orders quashing the informations and to remit the matter to the Local Court to be heard by another magistrate. It was not disputed that I had the power to make those orders under s 59(2)(a). 
     
      
    69 Mr Bonnici submitted that, even if I found the Magistrate erred, I should in the exercise of my discretion dismiss the appeal. He argued that the prosecution was bound to fail because it had misconceived the case and there was no evidence upon which the prosecution could prove any deceptive conduct intended to induce the relatives to hand over money. I cannot accept that submission and have gone to some pains to indicate how I understand the prosecution case and that in my view there is ample evidence, at least on a prima facie level, to prove both charges. Notwithstanding the submissions to the contrary, there is clearly no abuse of process in the prosecution seeking to continue the proceedings as against the Magistrate’s erroneous exercise of her jurisdiction on two occasions. Nor do any of the cases on res judicata or issue estoppel relied upon by Mr Bonnici have any relevance to a statutory right of appeal given to a prosecutor against a decision of a magistrate dismissing an information. As I have already indicated, Mr Bonnici in effect abandoned the relief sought under the Notice of Motion and was content to have the Court consider the exercise of its discretion under s 59. 
     
      
    70 In that regard Mr Bonnici noted that the matter had been before the courts for over four years and submitted that in effect there was no public interest in continuing the prosecution. He argued that, even if his client were convicted, no penalty would be imposed, as the court would, in all the circumstances, dismiss the charges under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He submitted that even if the Court held that there was a prima facie case, the prosecution evidence was weak and depended upon circumstantial evidence as to Mr Lee’s knowledge and intention. It is not in my opinion a circumstantial case, and as I have attempted to show, in my opinion if Mr Ebbott’s evidence is accepted beyond reasonable doubt, then it was open to a magistrate to find both of the offences proved. If I might say so with respect, it seems to me that Mr Bonnici has also misunderstood the real nature of the prosecution case. 
     
      
    71 I do not believe it is oppressive to continue this prosecution by remitting the matter to the Local Court. Mr Bonnici can always make an application to the DPP, if he has not already done so, for the prosecution to be terminated in the exercise of the Director’s discretion. I am not persuaded that the only outcome of the prosecution, even if successful, is a dismissal under s 10 or that this itself would be sufficient to justify dismissing the appeal. I do not wish to make any comment on the strength of the prosecution case, but I do not believe that it is so weak that it would warrant in effect bringing the prosecution to a conclusion by dismissing the appeal notwithstanding that in my view there is a prima facie case. 
     
      
    72 It is clear that another magistrate should hear the matter. Much of the evidence is not in dispute and could be dealt with in large part by the use of depositions. Clearly Mr Ebbott would have to be called again. It is unfortunate in the extreme that this matter should remain unresolved after such a lengthy period of time, but to some extent it is due to the inappropriate conduct of the matter when it was first before the magistrate. 
     
      
    73 I can see no purpose to be served in making any declarations.

     Suman SOOD v REGINA 
      
     
     
      
      Facts 
       
       
      The Appellant was convicted by a jury of 96 charges of dishonestly obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to s134.2 of the  
      Criminal Code Act 
       1995 (Cth). The Appellant was a medical practitioner and a registered provider with the Health Insurance Commission (HIC). The Crown case was that she had obtained a financial advantage from the HIC by claiming assigned Medicare benefits (via “bulk billing” arrangements) for the termination of pregnancy services whilst also imposing additional charges for those services on patients.  
       
       
      It was uncontested that the Appellant’s patients were charged additional fees for counselling and theatre services, and that these fees varied according to how advanced the patient’s pregnancy was. The Crown contended that this arrangement was contrary to s20A of the  
      Health Insurance Act 
       1973 (Cth), which relevantly provides for the assignment of Medicare benefits to practitioners “in full payment of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the professional service”. The claim form signed by the Appellant contained a declaration, which implemented this section in the form: “No payments have been sought … in respect of the professional services” the subject of the assignment. 
       
       
      The Crown case was that the Appellant was not entitled to make a claim for assigned benefits in the circumstances, that she knew this to be the case and, therefore, that she made a false statement on the claim forms in order to dishonestly obtain the benefits in question. At trial the question of entitlement was not seriously raised; the Defence case instead focusing on dishonesty. Whilst giving evidence, the Appellant appeared to accept that the arrangements at her clinic were contrary to the legislative scheme, although denied that she knew that at the relevant time.  
       
       
      Held (allowing the appeal): 
       
       
      1. Ruling by the Trial Judge on issue of entitlement  
       
      (per Spigelman CJ and Simpson J; Adams J not deciding)  
       
       
      The trial judge did not make a ruling that, as a matter of law, the Appellant made a false statement on the claim forms because she was not entitled to claim the benefits she did. [21], [24], [127].  
       
       
      2. Direction to the jury on false statement  
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J contra; Adams J not deciding) 
       
       
      The effect of the trial judges summing up was a direction to the jury that, as a matter of law, the Appellant made a false statement on the claim forms. [29], [130]. 
       
       
      3. Issue of entitlement question of law or fact 
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Adams J agreeing, Simpson J dissenting) 
       
       
      The issue of entitlement was a question of law for the trial judge. [30], [121], [132], [134], [138], [148].

      4. Whether additional services were “in respect of” procedure 
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Adams J contra; Simpson J not deciding) 
       
       
      The additional services were “in respect of” the procedure, given the wide meaning of “in respect of” in the statutory scheme. [51]-[52], [54], [63]-[67], [138], [149], [156]-[157].

      (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      The trial judge’s directions as to dishonesty were confusing with regard to a central element of the trial and therefore constituted a miscarriage of justice. The Trial judge failed to direct the jury in accordance with the definition of dishonesty in the  
      Criminal Code

      A new trial should be ordered. [112], [114], [158], [161].

     Suman SOOD v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was found guilty by a jury of 96 charges of dishonestly obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to s134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The Crown case was that she had obtained a financial advantage from the Health Insurance Commission (“HIC”) pursuant to claim forms she had submitted claiming Medicare benefits for a particular item number with respect to professional services she had performed. She was sentenced to 300 hours of community service on the first charge plus a fine of $250 on each of the other 95 charges, totalling $23,750. There is no appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 The Appellant was a medical practitioner registered as a provider with the HIC, enabling her to make claims for assigned Medicare benefits. She operated a clinic at which she provided termination of pregnancy services. 
     
      
    3 Under the Medicare scheme patients have a right to benefits from the Commonwealth for medical expenses. Pursuant to what is known as a bulk billing arrangement, a doctor may make a claim for payment directly from the HIC for services provided to patients, if there has been an assignment by the patient of his or her right to the payment of the Medicare benefit to the providing doctor. On the Crown case the legislative scheme under the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) (“the Act”) prohibited a claim for the payment of an assigned benefit where the Medicare benefit was not received as full payment for that professional service, i.e. where some other amount had been received by way of an additional charge for that service. 
     
      
    4 Each of the 96 counts referred to a claim for Medicare benefits under Item Number 35643 dealing with termination of pregnancy procedures (abortion). This Item Number specifies that a payment will be made for: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage not being a service to which item 35639/35640 applies, including procedures to which item 35626, 35627 or 35630 applies, where performed (Anaes. 17705 = 3B+2T).” 
        
       
      
    5 There was no dispute that the Appellant performed this procedure in each of the cases. There was also no dispute that the Appellant charged the patients directly for what were described as counselling and operating theatre services and received cash payment for these services prior to claiming under the Item Number. The Crown case was that there was no entitlement to make a claim for assigned benefits in the circumstances, that the Appellant knew this to be the case and dishonestly claimed the benefits in question. 
     
      
       
      Claim Procedure 
       
      
    6 The critical document in the Crown case was a document headed “Claim for Assigned Benefits for Services Rendered to Non-Hospital Patients”. This document is known as a “batch header,” to which is annexed the assignment forms signed by patients who, as noted above, assign to the provider the patients’ rights to payment of Medicare benefits. The claim forms are pre-printed Medicare forms which make provision for the insertion of the provider’s name, address, provider number, date, number of assignment forms attached and the total benefit amount claimed. 
     
      
    7 The bottom half of the form contains printed declarations beneath which the practitioner who rendered the services was required to sign. One of the declarations was that: “No payments have been sought from any person in respect of the professional services specified in the attached assignment forms …”. 
     
      
    8 It was the signature by the Appellant of each such declaration that constituted the relevant conduct which was alleged to contravene s134.2 of the Criminal Code, with respect to each annexed assignment form.  
     
      
    9 The declaration reflected the practice with respect to bulk billing arrangements contained in a book provided to all approved Medicare providers, known as the Medicare Benefits Schedule Book, a copy of which was found at the Appellant’s practice. That book explained the Medicare system, identified item numbers and set out the basis for direct or bulk billing arrangements.  
     
      
    10 Paragraph 7.5.2 of the Book provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “If a medical practitioner direct-bills, he/she undertakes to accept the relevant Medicare benefit as full payment for the service. Additional charges for that service (irrespective of the purpose or title of the charge) cannot be raised against the patient …” 
        
       
      
    11 The relevant section of the Act is: 
     
      
       
        
        “20A Assignment of Medicare benefit 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where a medicare benefit is payable to an eligible person in respect of a professional service rendered to the eligible person or to another eligible person, the first-mentioned eligible person and the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the professional service is rendered (in this subsection referred to as  
        the practitioner 
        ) may enter into an agreement, in accordance with the approved form, under which: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the first-mentioned eligible person assigns his or her right to the payment of the medicare benefit to the practitioner; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the practitioner accepts the assignment in full payment of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the professional service by the first-mentioned eligible person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where an assignment under this section takes effect, or an agreement under this section is entered into, with respect to a medicare benefit, the medicare benefit is, subject to section 20B, payable in accordance with the assignment or the agreement, as the case may be. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (5) An assignment of a medicare benefit shall not be made except in accordance with this section.” 
        
       
      
    12 Section 3 defines “professional service” relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “professional service  
        means: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) a service (other than a diagnostic imaging service) to which an item relates, being a clinically relevant service that is rendered by or on behalf of a medical practitioner; …” 
        
       
       
      This section also defines “item” to mean “an item in the table”, and “table” to mean “the table consisting of: (a) the general medical services table …”; and “medical expenses” to mean “an amount payable in respect of a professional service”. 
       
      
    13 The declaration on the claim form, referred to in [7] above, implemented s20A(1)(b) such that, where an assignment is made under s20A(1), the medical practitioner “accepts the assignment in full payment of the medical expenses incurred” (that is the amount payable) “in respect of the professional service by the” medical practitioner. 
     
      
       
       
      The Factual Background 
       
      
    14 The modus operandi of the Appellant’s practice was that, upon arrival at the Appellant’s clinic, patients went to reception where staff took an impression of the patient’s Medicare card on three separate assignment forms (two for the anaesthetist and one for Dr Sood). The patient then paid a fee in cash to the receptionist. There was no provision for credit card or any other form of payment. The additional fee varied depending on how advanced the patient’s pregnancy was. Charges for terminations varied from $120 for pregnancies of up to 12 weeks gestation to $1,000 for 19 weeks, with higher fees for weekend surgery. A receipt was written out for this additional payment which typically said “counselling and theatre” or “counselling and theatre services (or fees)”. 
     
      
    15 Before the termination procedure there was a form of interview or “counselling” undertaken by one of a number of nurses or nursing aides employed by the clinic, in addition to a consultation with Dr Sood. The consultation with Dr Sood was the subject of a separate claim for Medicare benefits pursuant to a bulk billing arrangement under Item Number 36, being for a consultation of over 20 minutes duration. This was in addition to the Medicare benefit claim for Item Number 35643 for the termination. The Crown did not pursue any case based on the Item Number 36 consultation. Its case focused on the combined effect, in the case of each termination, of the assigned claim under the bulk billing system for the one Item Number 35643 claim, together with the “counselling and theatre” fee paid in cash. 
     
      
    16 On 30 October 2001 officers of the Health Insurance Commission executed a search warrant at Dr Sood’s surgery. Records seized from the surgery included: 
     
      
    · receipt books for the additional payments for the period May 2001 to October 2001. Seven such books were located in surgical and biological waste material disposal bins in the patient recovery area of the surgery; 
     
      
    · original cash receipts for the period 16 October 2001 to 23 October 2001 which had also been found in one such bin. On the Crown case, both the books and the receipts had been put in the bins by the Appellant, she having been observed by Minna Zoretic, a nurse employed at the clinic, to have thrown something into one of the bins after the arrival of the HIC personnel at the clinic (T129.53). In evidence, the Appellant denied having disposed of the receipts in this way, or at all; 
     
      
    · “day books” listing the patients who attended Dr Sood’s surgery and summarising the Medicare benefits. The day books referred to the receipt written for each termination patient, but did not show the amount of any payment; 
     
      
    · a schedule of charges showing the additional charges payable by patients, depending on the stage of pregnancy; 
     
      
    · the Medicare Benefits Schedule Book. 
     
      
    17 The Appellant gave evidence. She denied that she had any dishonest intention. She said that she believed that she was entitled to charge the additional fees because the relevant item did not include any of the other services which she provided. She gave evidence that other clinics were charging additional fees of the same character. The defence tendered brochures from other clinics to this effect. The Appellant denied that she disposed of the receipt books which had been found in a bin on the premises at the time of the HIC search. During the course of the evidence she appeared to accept that the practice of requiring a patient to pay supplementary fees was not legal, but did not admit at any stage that she held that opinion at the time of making the relevant claims. 
     
      
    18 The focus of the case is the printed declaration beneath the batch header or claim form that: “No payments have been sought from any person in respect of a professional service as specified in the attached assignment forms”. This statement was the conduct which, on the Crown case, constituted the relevant deception and which was said to have been made dishonestly. 
     
      
       
      Ruling by the Trial Judge 
       
      
    19 Ground 1 of the appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge erred in law in holding that, as a matter of law, the Appellant made a false statement when she stated that no payment had been sought ‘in respect of’ specified professional services.” 
        
       
      
    20 The ruling which the Appellant alleges the trial judge made occurred in the course of a discussion, in the absence of the jury, quite early in the trial. His Honour had asked the Crown Prosecutor to identify the relevant dishonesty. He drew attention to the declaration on the bottom of the claim forms. In the course of this discussion the following transpired: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: … ‘In respect of’ is lifted straight from the legislation and whilst you might say, well, you wouldn’t interpret the form in the way as you would interpret legislation, the words ‘professional services’ must have the same meaning in the context. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: As a matter of law. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: As a matter of law it’s false. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: As a matter of law it’s false. That’s all I was concerned about yesterday. Obviously as a matter of law if it wasn’t false, then your case wouldn’t be looking very good. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But I am certainly sufficiently satisfied to say that is a matter of law, that it is false. I haven’t heard any argument to the contrary. I sort of have run this argument with you. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Later on when it is foreshadowed. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: There is no authority for the converse proposition, which is that this is not in respect of. Because you’re running a theatre, that the theatre is a separate entity, that you must maintain it separate from the charge and separate from the charge for the termination itself described by the Medicare number. And the theatre can only come down to a matter of belief that the money you are paid, bulk billed under that item number. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don’t know that you would concede that. If I were in your position, I wouldn’t. There are two issues: Firstly, the belief issue which is very clear. The second is the legal issue as to whether or it it’s in fact legally permissible to charge separate fees for separate services provided. The view I have reached depends upon the relationship between the service provided and the item which is the medical aspect of it. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: I understand that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: In my view these are closely enough related to be said to be ‘in respect of’ in accordance with the Act. It’s a matter for you whether you want to reserve your position in that argument for another place, if necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: I do. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s noted on the record. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: Thank you your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Or for another time. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: Another time. I will reserve my position. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: We might have further argument at the close of the Crown case. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s possible. I don’t think the evidence itself won’t change. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: The evidence won’t. The point has been taken. If comes up and somebody wants to run that elsewhere, well, they can. It might be locked out if I was – 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I won’t say any more about it because you might want to have more to say about it. 
        
       
       
        
        AINSWORTH: Thank you.” 
        
       
      
    21 At the end of this passage his Honour referred to the possibility that the argument would occur in “another place”, which is clearly a reference to an appeal. He also left open the possibility of further argument occurring at “another time”. That is clearly a reference to a subsequent point of time in the trial before his Honour. I do not regard this passage as indicating anything in the nature of a “ruling” by his Honour as relied upon in this ground of appeal. In the course of a preliminary discussion his Honour indicated a view as to what he would rule if called upon to do so. The circumstances in which such a ruling would have arisen could have included a no case to answer submission. However, in the event there was no such submission put. Alternatively, it could have arisen in the course of submissions about what were the appropriate directions to give to the jury in his Honour’s summing-up. There was no relevant submission on this matter. 
     
      
    22 The question of whether or not there was a false statement in the declaration on each of the claim forms could have been pertinent to the element in the offence of whether there was a “deception”. It could also have gone to the element in the offence of receiving a “financial benefit”. In neither respect was this matter pursued in the trial.  
     
      
    23 The defence case focused on the issue of dishonesty. It may be that this course of conduct arose by reason of the evidence given by the Respondent under cross-examination, which appeared to accept, as at the time of the trial, that she had no entitlement to the cash payments, implicitly agreeing that her statements were in fact false.  
     
      
    24 In any event, it appears that the trial judge was never called upon to make a ruling of the character which he had indicated in advance he would make if called upon to do so.  
     
      
    25 In the course of her cross-examination reference was made to a Dr Brodie who had conducted a practice in a similar manner. The following questions and answers occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You agree it is technically illegal to charge an out-of-pocket fee to supplement the Medicare rebate the way Dr Brodie was doing it in his clinic? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes because we were told that now. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Told that now? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I mean at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is what you were doing? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes I was doing it but nobody had told me it was wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you now accept what you were doing was illegal? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes if that is what the HIC law says that charge, or a private clinic cannot charge a theatre cost, that is right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest you knew at the time you charged the termination patients cash in 2001 you knew then it was illegal? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That is absolutely wrong.” 
        
       
      
    26 This passage in the cross-examination was referred to a number of times, not always accurately, in the summing-up in a manner which, in effect, amounted to a direction of law to the jury on the issue of falsity.  
     
      
    27 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submits that there is simply no doubt on the evidence that the accused filled those forms in and that the representation made by so doing, by filling in those forms, was in fact a false representation. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused in her evidence said that she now accepts that at least technically the statement is false. Of course her case is that she did not know or believe when she completed that form that the statement was false. She said that she believed she was entitled to charge that additional fee for the use of the operating theatre and for counselling. 
        
       
       
        
        This aspect of the case is closely related to the second element, namely, the element of dishonesty and I will set out in more detail why the accused says that she believed she was entitled to charge those fees and why she therefore did not believe that the statement made in the batch form was false.” (SU 13-14) 
        
       
      
    28 Soon after this passage his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence that supports the making of the allegedly false statements is not essentially in dispute.” (SU 15) 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to say: 
       
       
        
        “Dr Sood does not contend that the patients were not charged an additional fee. She also does not contend that she did not complete the batch forms. She does not contend that it is not technically false that is, she says that she now understands that to be the case, but she contends that at the time when she completed those forms and that at the relevant time as far as these charges are concerned she did not believe the statement was false. To the contrary she contends that she believed that she was entitled to charge a fee for use of the operating theatre and for counselling …” (SU 15-16) 
        
       
      
    29 It does appear that the effect of the summing-up was, in substance, a direction to the jury that, as a matter of law, the statements were false. 
     
      
    30 Before the trial judge and in this Court both the Appellant and the Respondent proceeded on the basis that the issue of falsity was an issue of law for the trial judge. This can sometimes be a difficult question to determine. (See, e.g. R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 esp at [12]-[15] and cf [123]-[132].) There is no universally applicable test for distinguishing questions of law from questions of fact. (Collector of Customs v AGFA-Gevaert Ltd (1995) 186 CLR 389 at 394.) Whether facts fully found fall within a statutory formulation is usually a question of law. (Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7; Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council (2001) 202 CLR 439 at [24]-[26].) This Court should proceed on the basis accepted at trial and urged on this Court by both parties. Whether a payment has been made “in respect of a professional service” is analogous to whether a procedure was “connected with the rearing of livestock”, found to be a question of law in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280. 
     
      
    31 It does appear, on the above analysis, that counsel for the Appellant at trial had left open to him the opportunity of making submissions on the issue of falsity prior to the summing-up, which opportunity he did not take up. Rule 4 applies. In the circumstances I would grant leave. 
     
      
    32 First, during the course of the discussions there was an express reservation of the ability to take the point on appeal. Secondly, the issue is, on the basis accepted by both parties, a pure question of law and many of the considerations concerned with the finality of a jury trial, with respect to taking points on appeal not taken at trial, do not apply. Thirdly, if the Appellant’s contention is right, and the statements were not false as a matter of law, there would be a clear miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    33 In any event, the issue of entitlement is of significance to whether this Court should order a new trial if, as I will indicate is the case on Ground 2, the Court allows the appeal on another ground. Accordingly, it needs to be addressed. 
     
      
       
      The False Statement Issue 
       
      
    34 The basic submission of the Appellant turns on the terminology of Item Number 35643 and specifically on the introductory words: “evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage …”. The series of acts so performed by a medical practitioner are the acts involved in the removal of the contents of the patient’s uterus. The Appellant submits that the benefit is payable for that procedure and does not include counselling provided to the patient prior to such procedure. Nor, the Appellant submits, does it include payment for the use of facilities where the procedure is performed. Accordingly, the Appellant submits that the counselling/theatre fee that was charged was not a charge “in respect of the professional service” specified in Item No 35643. 
     
      
    35 The Crown’s submissions are based on the width of the phrase “in respect of” in s20A(1)(b) reflected, in terms, in the declaration on the claim form. The Crown relies on the judgment of Enderby J in Dalima Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (New South Wales Supreme Court, Unreported, 22 October 1987). 
     
      
    36 In Dalima a “facilities fee” was charged to patients attending medical centres. The issue that arose was whether or not these fees constituted “an amount payable in respect of medical services” rendered at the centres within the meaning of s20A of the Health Insurance Act 1973. One of the issues was whether or not a medical practitioner who made the statement that “no payments have been sought from any person for professional services” was false or misleading in a material particular within s129 of the Act, which proscribed the making of false or misleading statements.  
     
      
    37 Enderby J accepted the submission that the words “in respect of” were of “notoriously wide import” and were “sufficiently wide to make the facility fee an additional fee in respect of the service rendered”. He rejected a submission on behalf of the medical service provider in that case to the effect that the medical services could only be said to be provided when the doctor and patient were “face to face”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I hope the law reflects reality and I have no doubt that the reality of what is happening in the two sentences is that a fee called a ‘facility fee’ is being charged by Dr Edelstein’s company to patients as a condition of them being able to use the centres and gain access to a doctor and receive medical services from a doctor. 
        
       
       
        
        The facility fee is an amount payable in respect of the service. It matters not that the service is being rendered also relates to an item in the table.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour went on to hold that the imposition of a facility fee prevented the medical service provider in that case from accepting an assignment and bulk billing. 
     
      
    39 Since the judgment of Enderby J in Dalima the High Court has had occasion to observe that the wide meaning accorded to the words “in respect of” is not always appropriate.  
     
      
    40 In Workers’ Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 642, Wilson and Gaudron JJ said at 646-647: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been said, perhaps somewhat extravagantly, that the words ‘in respect of’ ‘have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connexion or relation between the two subject-matters to which the words refer’:  
        Trustees Executors & Agency Co. Ltd. v. Reilly  
        [[1941] VLR 110 at 111], cited in  
        State Government Insurance Office (Q.) v. Crittenden  
        [(1966) 117 CLR 412 at 416]. The words were cited again by Gibbs J. in  
        McDowell v Baker  
        [(1979) 144 CLR 413 at 419], and by Mason J. in  
        State Government Insurance Office (Q.) v. Rees  
        [(1979) 144 CLR 549 at 561], when his Honour added the comment: ‘But, as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to ‘in respect of’ depends very much on the context in which it is found’.” 
        
       
      
    41 To similar effect are the observations of Dean, Dawson and Toohey JJ in that case at 653-654: 
     
      
       
        
        “Undoubtedly the words ‘in respect of’ have a wide meaning, although it is going somewhat too far to say, as did Mann C.J. in  
        Trustees Executors & Agency Co. Ltd. v. Reilly  
        [[1941] V.R 110 at 111], that ‘they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation between the two subject-matters to which the words refer’. The phrase gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends.” 
        
       
      
    42 The authorities have recently been set out by Campbell J in Wonall Pty Limited v Clarence Property Corporation Limited (2003) 58 NSWLR 23 at [41]-[43]. 
     
      
    43 The width of the phrase “in respect of” depends on the statutory context. This was not a matter on which the Court received detailed submissions. 
     
      
    44 The relevant statutory context is not criminal legislation but a system for government subsidy of medical payments with complex safeguards for the revenue. The bulk billing system manifests a policy objective of limiting patient expenditure on medical services, whilst retaining the traditional doctor/patient relationship. Medical practitioners receive the certainty of payment without any bad debts, in exchange for restraint on the fees they can charge. 
     
      
    45 The words “in respect of” are ubiquitous in the legislative scheme. They appear in numerous sections other than s20A. A quick overview of the Act would suggest that they appear well over 100 times. The focus of attention in this case is the use of the word in s20A(1)(b), namely the reference to the assignment being accepted in full payment of “medical expenses incurred in respect of the professional service by the first mentioned eligible person”. It is this formulation that finds its way into the declaration in the claims form. 
     
      
    46 In s20A(1) the words, “first mentioned eligible person” are a reference back to the introductory words of the section which, to repeat, states: “Where a medicare benefit is payable to an eligible person in respect of a professional service rendered to the eligible person”. As can be seen the words “in respect of” occur in this formulation also. Where there occurring they constitute a reference back to s20(1) which states: 
     
      
       
        
        “20(1) Subject to this Part, medicare benefit in respect of a professional service is payable by the Commission on behalf of the Commonwealth to the person who incurs the medical expenses in respect of that service.” 
        
       
      
    47 Again, as can be seen, the words “in respect of” appear twice in this subsection. 
     
      
    48 The use of the phrase appears again in the particular circumstance from which s20(2) makes provision as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “20(2) Where a person to whom a medicare benefit is payable under subsection (1) in respect of a professional service has not paid the medical expenses that he or she has incurred in respect of that professional service, he or she shall not be paid the medicare benefit but, if he or she so requests, there shall, in lieu of that payment, be given to him or her … a cheque for the amount of the medicare benefit drawn in favour of the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the professional service was rendered.” 
        
       
      
    49 Section 20 is concerned to identify the persons who are entitled to Medicare benefits. It is s10 which establishes the entitlement to Medicare benefits, again with use of the phrase “in respect of”. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) Where, on or after 1 February 1984, medical expenses are incurred in respect of a professional service rendered in Australia to an eligible person, medicare benefit calculated in accordance with subsection (2) is payable, subject to and in accordance with this Act, in respect of that professional service.” 
        
       
      
    50 Subsequent sections of the Act use the phrase “in respect of a professional service” in numerous different contexts including: 
     
      
    · Stating that a Medicare benefit shall not exceed the medical expenses incurred (s14).  
     
      
    · Restricting the Medicare benefit payable where two or more operations are performed on the one occasion where each constitute a professional service covered by a separate Item (s15). 
     
      
    · Restricting the circumstances in which Medicare benefit is payable with respect to the administration of an anaesthetic (s16) or with respect to a pathology service (s16) or with respect to a certain diagnostic imaging service (s16B). 
     
      
    · Establishing that Medicare benefit is not payable if medical expenses “in respect of that service” have been paid to a recognised hospital that was prescribed and an amount had been paid pursuant to a scheme under which a health programme grant had been made. 
     
      
    · Establishing that Medicare benefit is not payable where a person has received compensation for personal injury (s18). 
     
      
    · Establishing that Medicare benefit is not payable for a medical examination for the purposes of life insurance or superannuation (s19). 
     
      
    51 Numerous other provisions could be added to this list. The cumulative effect is such that, in the scheme of this legislation, there is no basis for giving anything but a broad meaning to the words “in respect of a professional service”. 
     
      
    52 The Court should be very slow to find in such a statutory context that the words “in respect of a professional service” are not intended to encompass all matters directly incidental to the provision of that service. 
     
      
    53 The concluding words of Item Number 35643, which I have quoted above, are “Anaes. 17722”. This is a reference back to another part of the table which provides for the provision of anaesthetic services. That part is said to apply in the following manner: “Administration of an anaesthetic – in connection with a medical service which has been assigned an anaesthetic unit value …”, relevantly 17722. The table makes provision for an amount payable for the anaesthetic service. Accordingly, where another medical service that is incidental to the abortion itself has been identified as justifying a separate payment, express reference is made. It is true that this service is provided by a different medical specialisation, but nevertheless this linkage is indicative. 
     
      
    54 As set out above, Item 35643 does not apply where Item 35639/35640 applies. That item is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Uterus, curettage of … where undertaken in a hospital or approved day hospital facility …” 
        
       
      
    55 Accordingly, in the relevant context, the table makes separate provision, where thought appropriate, with respect to the place that the medical service is provided. This indicates that a separate theatre fee is impermissible for bulk billing. 
     
      
    56 Since writing the above, I have read the judgment of Adams J in draft.  
     
      
    57 His Honour refers to the modesty of the fee as a matter suggesting a restrictive interpretation of “in respect of”. The appropriateness or otherwise of the fee in relation to the costs of providing a medical service is, no doubt, an important issue of a political character in determining fees in the table and the structure of the table where, as in this case, more than one fee is payable with respect to a single operation. In my opinion, the asserted “modesty” of the fee is of no assistance on statutory interpretation. In any event, the evidence of the Appellant on the inadequacy of the fee, which may have been relevant to the issue of dishonesty, is an inadequate evidentiary foundation for any inference, if relevant at all. 
     
      
    58 His Honour also relies on the proposition that a “minimum standard” is an “assumption inherent in the item”. There is no evidentiary basis for any such “assumption”. Nor is there, in my opinion, any warrant for the inference that charging patients for a ‘higher standard’ of services is consistent with the bulk billing regime. Indeed, in my opinion, bulk billing is, in part, directed to preventing such conduct which results in higher charges to patients. 
     
      
    59 Each of the additional payments in issue in the present case were identified as being for counselling and theatre fees, although sometimes there were separate charges. The evidence by the various employees of the medical centre operated by the Appellant, and of the Appellant herself, confirmed that the counselling and theatre fees charged were inextricably connected with the termination itself. In the case of a theatre component of the fee it was a fee for the location in which the termination was conducted. In the case of the counselling component it was payment for a consultation as to whether or not the termination should proceed. 
     
      
    60 In the Appellant’s own evidence she gave the following answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If they were having a termination they were charged for the theatre because they were in there having a termination? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, you are right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They were charged for counselling because they were there to have a termination? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes they were. We had patients who did not have termination and had counselling also and we had patients who were not for termination and had counselling also. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m just asking you about the patients who had terminations at the moment, all right? The patients who had terminations were charged for counselling because they were there to have a termination, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It’s a juggling of words I think. We were charging counselling which was just counselling. It could be for anything.” 
        
       
      
    61 In subsequent questioning she was asked whether or not the counselling was “part of the process” and replied that it was a “pre-requisite” for the termination but not “part of the termination”. In my opinion, a “pre-requisite” is sufficiently closely connected to be “in respect of the professional service” for which it is a “pre-requisite”. 
     
      
    62 As indicated above, the fee, most often a single fee for both matters, was charged on the sliding scale depending on the length of the pregnancy. Indeed, where persons had been charged a certain amount on the assumption that a pregnancy was of a certain period, but it transpired subsequently that the period was in fact longer, then an additional fee was charged. 
     
      
    63 I am of the view that the position with respect to the theatre charges is quite clear. It was an essential part of the provision of the medical service for a termination of pregnancy that a sterile place be provided for the conduct of the operation. Under the bulk billing arrangements, there is no more justification for charging extra for this service than there would be for charging extra for other matters necessarily incidental to the conduct of a physical facility in which the service is to be provided. In this respect it is identical to the “facility fee” found to be inextricably linked in Dalima. 
     
      
    64 The “consultation fee”, for those few cases when it was separate, is not so clear. The evidence suggests that this is a consultation by a nurse as to whether or not the abortion should proceed at all. It is not clear why this is separate from the consultation by Dr Sood herself for which a separate charge was made in each case. These claims were not challenged in the proceedings as outlined above at [15]. Presumably, where the result of the consultation with a nurse is that the abortion does not proceed, no Medicare benefit claim could be made under Item Number 35643. In such a case there could be no assignment of the Medicare benefit and it could not be said that any consultation fee paid was “in respect of the professional service”, being the termination.  
     
      
    65 The issue for present purposes is what is the position with respect to those occasions on which the consultation resulted in the termination proceeding, when a claim was made. My mind has fluctuated on this but, in the event, I have formed the view that the words “in respect of” in the context are so wide that they cannot be relevantly read down. In my opinion, the preliminary consultation is encompassed within the termination to which the relevant item number relates. 
     
      
    66 I am influenced in this conclusion by a number of considerations of the facts of this case. First, no patient was offered a choice. It was an essential precondition of any termination that there be such a consultation. Secondly, in many, it appears most, cases, there was no differentiation between the “theatre” and the “consultation” fee. Thirdly, in every case, the fee was increased depending on the length of the pregnancy. Each of these matters suggest that, as a matter of practice in this medical clinic, the consultation fees were inextricably linked to the termination itself. Accordingly, these fees were paid “in respect of the professional service” to which Item 35643 refers. 
     
      
    67 On this basis, the lack of entitlement was made out as a matter of law. Other submissions were made under this ground of appeal but it is unnecessary to deal with them.

    68 Ground 2 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge erred in respect of the directions to the jury in respect of dishonesty.” 
        
       
      
    69 Each of the charges was lain pursuant to s134.1 of the Criminal Code which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “134.1(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person, by deception, dishonestly obtains property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of the property; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the property belongs to a Commonwealth entity.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    70 The Code also contains a definition of dishonesty as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “130.3 For the purposes of this Chapter dishonest means: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) known by the defendant to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    71 The two elements identified in this section are in accordance with the test at common law for dishonesty, known as the Ghosh test, which the High Court determined would no longer apply to the common law of Australia in Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493. Relevantly, the High Court held that the test was inappropriate by reason of its inclusion of the element of whether or not an accused knew that the conduct was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people.  
     
      
    72 The reintroduction by 130.3(b) of this second element in the Ghosh test was deliberate. The Explanatory Memorandum for the Criminal Code expressly addresses itself to the judgment in Peters and indicates that the proposal was intended to reinstate the second element in the Ghosh test as a matter of legislative policy. This had been approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. (Explanatory Memorandum par [62]-[65].)  
     
      
    73 During the course of the trial no one drew his Honour’s attention to the definition of “dishonesty” found in the Code. Accordingly, when his Honour came to direct the jury on the second element of the charges, having dealt with the element of “deception”, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The element of dishonesty is in effect a control issue. The jury as representatives of the community must judge the accused’s conduct and decide to what extent that conduct corresponds with the standards of reasonable decent people in the community.” 
        
       
      
    74 The Crown relied on this passage as conveying the substance of s130.3. However, as can be observed, there is no reference to the second limb of the definition of dishonesty with respect to the knowledge of the accused.  
     
      
    75 Although, plainly, it would have been preferable for the jury to be directed in accordance with the statutory provision, Mr Odgers SC, who appeared for the Appellant in this Court, acknowledged that he could not suggest a miscarriage of justice had occurred if the balance of the summing-up with respect to the element of dishonesty conveyed the substance of s130.3(b). In particular, to use the terminology of the submissions and of the direction in this case, which I will set out in some further detail below, Mr Odgers acknowledged that, if the jury had been directed that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused “did know that she was not entitled to charge a fee and bulk bill her clients”, then he could not contend that the substance of the second limb of the definition of dishonesty in the Code had not been conveyed to the jury. He accepted that if the Appellant knew that she was not entitled to charge the fee, then she must have known that this was dishonest in accordance with the standards of the community. 
     
      
    76 The Appellant also submitted that his Honour erred in referring to recklessness on the issue of dishonesty. In a passage of the summing-up where his Honour was directing the jury with respect to the first element, i.e. the matter of “deception”, he had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Deception is defined in the law to mean an intentional or reckless deception whether by words or by conduct. Deception is the intentional or reckless inducing in another of a state of mind which the accused knows does not accord with the fact.” 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour was there reciting the relevant part of the definition of “deception” in the Code. The difficulty was that it was not part of the Crown case that the deception in these proceedings involved an element of “recklessness”. The Crown case was directed, and directed only, to an intentional act of deception.  
     
      
    78 His Honour went on to say, again when dealing with the element of deception: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here the Crown submits that the accused represented to the Health Insurance Commission in each offence that she had not charged any additional amount in respect of the professional service that she was bulk billing for. I have used that colloquial term bulk billing but I hope you all understand what it means by now. In each case the Crown alleged that the statement involved a deliberate inducing of the Health Insurance Commission and the statement we are referring to and the one that the Crown referred to is conveniently contained in one of the documents that you were given a copy of, we marked it as MFI 1 but you probably recognise it as I hold it up to you. The statement is this statement here which I have highlighted but it read this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘No payments have been sought from any person in respect of the professional services specified in the attached assignment forms.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Now  
        alternatively the Crown alleges a reckless inducement, that is, that the statement was made by the accused without her caring whether it was true or not 
        . The Crown submits that there is simply no doubt on the evidence that the accused filled those forms in and that the representations made by so doing, by filling in those forms, was in fact a false representation.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    79 As it appears, his Honour asserted that the Crown case did, in the alternative, allege a “reckless” deception. This was never the Crown case, as the Crown acknowledges in this Court. The Appellant relies on this error by his Honour, in combination with his Honour’s directions on dishonesty, as leading to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    80 That the issues of deception and dishonesty overlapped was clear. His Honour indicated, in a passage shortly after reciting the definition of deception as quoted above:  
     
      
       
        
        “This aspect of the case is closely related to the second element, namely, the element of dishonesty and I will set out in more detail why the accused says that she believed that she was entitled to charge those fees and why she therefore did not believe that the statement made in the batch form was false.” 
        
       
      
    81 Furthermore, shortly before turning to the element of dishonesty, his Honour reiterated the proposition when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, as you will appreciate this element and the second element of dishonesty are closely related. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown have proved that there was a deception employed by Dr Sood when she completed the various batch forms which included the statement to the effect that she had not charged any additional amount in respect of the scheduled item then you should find the accused not guilty, otherwise you move on to consider the second element.” 
        
       
      
    82 His Honour then went on to deal with the second element i.e. dishonesty. Thereafter his Honour employed terminology of a closely related, but quite distinctive character, when identifying for the jury the way they should approach the issues that had arisen with respect to the second element.  
     
      
    83 On some occasions his Honour used the formulation that the Appellant “did not believe that she was entitled to charge” the cash fees. On other occasions his Honour formulated the proposition in terms that she “did know that she was not entitled to charge” the cash fees and bulk bill her clients. As can be seen these two ways of expressing the proposition are quite distinct. Nevertheless, both matters arose.  
     
      
    84 As Mr D Staehli SC, who appeared for the Crown, submitted, the Crown had to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the Respondent did not believe that she was entitled to charge the fees. That was the precise case that had been mounted by the defence on the basis of the Respondent’s own evidence expressed in those terms, namely, that she believed that she was entitled to charge the fees. Accordingly, he submitted, the Crown had to establish beyond reasonable doubt that this defence was not made out and his Honour’s references of this character should be understood as directed to this proposition.  
     
      
    85 However, with respect to the Crown’s own obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt the dishonesty element of the offence, it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused did know that she was not entitled to charge the cash fees and bulk bill. Plainly there was scope for confusion. 
     
      
    86 It was unnecessary for the jury to be separately directed with respect to the Crown’s technical obligation to establish that the defence was not made out in this respect. Ultimately the jury had to find that the accused knew that she was not entitled to charge the fees. Such a finding necessarily encompassed a finding that she did not believe that she was so entitled. The prospect of confusion was such that it was better that no direction in the latter form be made at all. However, no miscarriage of justice would have occurred if the directions on the two distinct issues that arose had been clearly separated. 
     
      
    87 I propose to set out the various passages in the summing-up in which his Honour used the two alternative formulations with a view to determining whether the summing-up was adequate in this respect, particularly in view of the direction about recklessness that he had given in the context of the directions on the element of deception and in view of his Honour’s failure to direct in the terms of s130.3 of the Code. 
     
      
    88 Immediately after his Honour introduced the second element i.e. the element of dishonesty, in the passage I have quoted above in [73] his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the accused does not have to prove anything. She does not have to prove that she believed that she was entitled to charge the Medicare fees that she did. The proper way of looking at this is to ask this question.  
        Has the Crown satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that she was entitled to obtain a Medicare benefit fee 
         through the bulk billing system in circumstances where she had also charged a cash fee to each of the patients for whom she made a claim?  
        I will repeat 
         that because you might think there are a couple of negatives in there and there are.  
        Has the Crown satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that she was entitled to obtain a Medicare benefit 
         fee through the bulk billing system in circumstances where she had also charged a cash fee to each of the patients for whom she made a claim?  
        An answer to that question will assist you to decide whether the accused could be said to have acted dishonestly 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on a number of different aspects of the evidence to support the contention that  
        the accused did know that she was not entitled 
         to charge such a fee and bulk bill her clients.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    89 I will refer to this as the first direction on dishonesty. 
     
      
    90 His Honour went on to outline the evidence on which the Crown relied for the last proposition, i.e. that “the accused did know that she was not entitled to charge such a fee”. His Honour referred to the batch document itself and the declaration contained in it; the Medicare Guidelines document found in the accused’s office; Dr Sood’s own evidence that she had read those Guidelines; and, finally, the dumping of the receipts in the bin. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those are the primary facts relied on by the Crown to establish that  
        the accused in fact did know that she was not entitled to charge the additional fee 
        .” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    91 Subsequently, when reviewing the submissions made by the parties his Honour commenced with the reliance placed by the Crown on the declaration on each of the claim forms and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submitted that its case was that Dr Sood told a lie in relation to each of those forms. She told a deliberate falsehood with respect to those matters, that is, that  
        she knew that she was telling a lie a 
        nd that it was deliberately false.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    92 His Honour also said in this context: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case here it was submitted is that in the circumstances of a doctor bulk billing then  
        she knew that a professional was not entitled to bulk bill 
         the claim when she had also sought another fee with respect to that claim. The Crown contends that counselling and/or theatre fees were all items in respect of the termination and consequently the doctor was not entitled to claim Medicare in the form that she did. The Crown submits that it is clear that the declarations were in fact false. 
        
       
       
        
        To support the contention that  
        Dr Sood knew that she was making deliberate falsehoods 
         the Crown points to a number of items …” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    93 As can be seen, each of the references quoted in [87]-[89] are correct. However, his Honour also used the alternative formulation, relevant to rebuttal of the defence case, and never distinguished between the two formulations. 
     
      
    94 While still dealing with the Crown case, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “if  
        she did not believe that she was being dishonest 
         it was submitted then the Crown has not proved its case and she is entitled to an acquittal.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    95 His Honour then referred to the receipts being found in the bin and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you accept the Crown’s argument that it must have been the accused who put those in the rubbish bin then the Crown further submits that it tells you something very clearly about  
        whether or not the accused honestly believed that she was entitled to charge a cash fee 
         in addition to the Medicare charge when she bulk billed. In effect the Crown argues that to have understood the importance of the receipt books would carry with it the obvious knowledge that the accused was not entitled to charge a cash fee when she bulk billed her clients.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    96 His Honour’s concluding reference to the Crown case was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question here is  
        whether the Crown has proved that she did not honestly believe that she was entitled to charge 
         an additional cash fee at the same time as claiming a Medicare fee through the bulk billing system. The Crown clearly submits that you will have no reasonable doubt about that and that you will answer that question in the affirmative.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    97 His Honour then turned to the defence case and noted that counsel for the Crown had posed a question in terms of “Whether she believed that she was entitled to so charge on the 96 claims that were made?” (SU 27.1). He then referred to the submission for the Appellant in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted that unless the Crown satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that  
        she did know 
         at the time of the various offences  
        that she was not entitled to 
         use the bulk billing system and charge the additional fees then she cannot be convicted.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    98 Various aspects of the Appellant’s conduct were relied upon in this respect. His Honour then set out the following submission for the Appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “How, it is argued, could it be said that  
        she did not believe she was entitled to charge 
         those fees in those circumstances. It is submitted, given the evidence, how could it be said, let alone proved beyond reasonable doubt, that she did not believe in that entitlement. If it cannot then she should be acquitted.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    99 Again, as can be seen, the two formulations were used without differentiation. 
     
      
    100 A test that: “She did not believe she was entitled” is deceptively similar to a test: “She knew she was not entitled”. Both issues arose. It was important that the former test, if mentioned at all, be linked expressly to the Crown negativing the defence case. However, in view of the burden and standard of proof, it was imperative that the jury be left in no doubt that the latter test had to be that which was ultimately applied and that the former was merely a step along the way. This was not, in my opinion, done. 
     
      
    101 As the extracts I have set out above indicate, the two tests were intermingled in a way which could have left the jury with the impression that all the Crown had to do was establish that the Appellant did not believe that she was entitled. 
     
      
    102 I place particular weight on what I have called above the first direction on dishonesty set out in [88]. This direction occurred at the outset of his Honour’s directions on the “second element”. He was not reciting submissions. This was the direction of law which the jury had to obey. 
     
      
    103 In the course of this direction his Honour said, twice, that the question the jury had to ask was whether “the accused did not believe that she was entitled”. This question was reinforced by the statement that: “An answer to that question will assist you to decide whether the accused could be said to have acted dishonestly”. 
     
      
    104 It is the case that his Honour immediately referred to the Crown’s “contention” that the “accused did know that she was not entitled” and repeated the formulation shortly thereafter. At the very least, this was confusing. It concerned the central element of the trial. In my view this constituted a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    105 Furthermore, it highlights his Honour’s failure to direct in the terms of s130.3 of the Code. I am not satisfied that the jury was directed that it had to find that the Appellant knew she was not entitled. As Mr Odgers submitted, in the absence of such a direction, the jury could not have applied the definition of dishonesty in s130.3 of the Code. 
     
      
    106 The references to recklessness were inaccurate. If that had been the only error, it may have been appropriate to refuse leave under Rule 4. However, the combined effect of the errors on the critical issue in the trial is such as to justify leave being given. The Appellant has not had a trial according to law. The deficiencies in the trial were of fundamental significance to the issues in dispute. 
     
      
       
      Direction on Consciousness of Guilt 
       
      
    107 Ground 3 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge erred in failing to give proper directions regarding evidence relied upon to show consciousness of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    108 In view of my conclusion on Ground 2, it is unnecessary to consider this ground. There is a real issue whether the point was pressed at trial. No doubt it will be at a retrial. In any new trial the directions in this respect may well be different. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    109 The Appellant submitted that, if the Court came to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, the Court should not order a new trial. She relied on a number of factors in this regard. 
     
      
    110 The Appellant submitted that the prosecution case could not be regarded as strong and noted, in particular, the evidence of the Appellant herself about her belief as to her entitlement to charge the additional fees and the experience of the practice of other clinics in this regard. Whether or not the Appellant should be believed in this respect was a matter for the jury. This Court should be very slow to intervene with the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion to put the Appellant to trial on any such basis. 
     
      
    111 The Appellant also submitted that the public interest in the administration of justice was not engaged to a high degree, by reason of the fact that the offence related only to the bulk billing system. The Appellant could make charges of the relevant character directly to the clients. The issue that has arisen is one concerning the process of payment, not the amount paid. This, again, is a matter for the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion. Whether or not criminal charges should be lain with respect to perceived abuse of one of the nations most fundamental social welfare systems raises considerations of a general character well beyond the individual case. This is not a matter on which the Court should place weight when determining whether or not to override the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion. 
     
      
    112 The only substantive matter raised in this regard concerned the issue of entitlement. If this Court had come to the conclusion that, as a matter of law, the Appellant was entitled to charge an additional fee then, no order for a new trial would have been appropriate. As indicated above, the Appellant’s contentions in this respect should be rejected. 
     
      
    113 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1 Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2 Conviction and sentence quashed. 
       
       
      3 There be a new trial. 
       
      
    114 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, that Ground 2 should be upheld and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    115 I have found Ground 1 more troubling. I regret that I am unable to agree with his Honour’s approach to, or analysis of, this ground. In order to express my concerns it is necessary that I say something about the background. I do not propose to restate all the factual matters that are set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    116 Each of the 96 charges against the appellant was framed in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “For that she on or about [date] ... did by deception dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from ... the Health Insurance Commission ... in that she submitted claim form number ... claiming Medicare benefits for item number 35643 being professional services performed by her in respect of which she had already sought and received payment from the patient.” 
        
       
      
    117 In each case the financial advantage alleged was the payment to the appellant of the Medicare fee under what is known as “bulk-billing” arrangements in respect of the performance by her of a pregnancy termination. The deception alleged was the signing by the appellant of a declaration that: 
     
      
       
        
        “No payments have been sought from any person in respect of the professional services specified in the attached assignment forms and claims transmission summary sheet.” 
        
       
       
      The “professional services” rendered were, in each case, the termination of pregnancy procedure, referred to as item number 35643, and spelled out in full in para [4] of the judgment of the Chief Justice. The signing of the declaration was said to be a deception because the declaration was false. The declaration was said to be false because in each case the appellant had in fact, sought (and received) payment in respect of the professional services from the patient. It was the Crown case that it was false to declare that no payment had been sought in respect of the professional services because the appellant had, on a regular basis (and in relation to each claim that became the subject of a count on the indictment), sought (and received) from each patient fees in respect of two additional services – one for counselling services, and one for the provision of operating theatre facilities. Both the counselling and the operating theatre services were associated with the pregnancy termination. 
       
      
    118 It is not necessary at this point to say anything about the element of dishonesty. 
     
      
    119 The evidence that the appellant had performed the pregnancy termination procedures, that she had used the bulk-billing arrangements to receive payment, that she had charged each patient a separate fee for counselling and theatre services, that the counselling and theatre services were associated with, or provided in relation to, the pregnancy termination, and that she had signed the declarations, was undisputed. The nub of the Crown case was that the declarations made by the appellant were false – that is, that it was false to declare, as the appellant declared, that no payment had been sought from any person in respect of the professional services (the pregnancy termination services). Whether each declaration was false depended upon whether the counselling services and/or theatre services were an integral part of, or so closely related as properly to be seen as part of, the pregnancy termination procedure – that is, whether they were payments in respect of the pregnancy termination. 
     
      
    120 It was the Crown contention that these services were services provided in respect of the pregnancy termination procedures. As it happened, the appellant in effect conceded that this was so. She conceded that (given her use of the bulk-billing arrangements) she was not entitled to charge the separate fees. That amounted to a concession that those fees were payments she had sought in respect of the pregnancy termination procedure. That necessarily entailed a concession that the declarations were false. 
     
      
    121 Ground 1 of the appeal is pleaded in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judged erred in law in holding that, as a matter of law, the appellant made a false statement when she stated that no payment had been sought ‘in respect of’ specified professional services.” 
        
       
       
      The ground, as framed, and the approach taken to the argument by both parties was, in my opinion, based upon two fundamental misconceptions. The first is that Blackmore DCJ made a ruling of law to the effect that the declarations made by the appellant were false; the second, which underlies the first, is that it was open to his Honour to make such a ruling. In my opinion, his Honour made no such ruling, and it would have been quite inappropriate for him to do so. Whether a declaration is false is, in my opinion, essentially a finding of fact to be made by the jury. 
       
      
    122 The ruling of law was said (on behalf of the appellant) to have been made during the course of the trial, on the third day. At this stage only two witnesses had given evidence. Both were women who had worked in the appellant’s clinic during the period covered by the charges. Each gave evidence about the counselling and theatre fees. Cross-examination of each witness was minimal and did not incorporate any challenge to her evidence. Their evidence was, and remained, undisputed and unchallenged. When the appellant gave evidence she effectively confirmed it. Importantly, for the purpose of analysing this ground of appeal, she also accepted, in cross-examination, that she was not entitled to receive the fees (if she were also to bulk bill for the pregnancy terminations). This was the basis for the concession to which I have referred. The appellant’s case was that she had, at the time, believed in her entitlement to receive the fees and that the Crown had not proved the element of dishonesty. Having regard to her acceptance that the counselling and theatre fees were impermissible, she did not take issue with the Crown contention that the declarations were false. 
     
      
    123 After these two witnesses had given evidence there was quite extensive discussion, on the second and third days of the trial, between Blackmore DCJ and both counsel. This ranged over a number of areas. There does not appear to have been any particular application or request that gave rise to the discussion. It appears to have been a fairly cooperative exercise on the part of the trial judge and both counsel to explore legal issues that might arise in the trial. In any event, at one stage on the second day, the Crown Prosecutor put to his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “We say the definition irresistibly leads to an inference that you are not entitled to do that,  
        as a matter of law 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
       
      The “that” that he suggested was not permissible was charging the additional fees. It is this contention that these fees were not,  
      as a matter of law 
      , permissible that is of present significance. The following morning the discussion resumed, with reference being made by the Crown Prosecutor to the decision of Enderby J in  
      Dalima Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia 
      , unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 22 October 1987. A little later the trial judge is recorded as saying to the Crown Prosecutor: 
       
       
        
        “Your response is, isn’t it, that she charges for a consultation in her room and charges for an operative procedure in the theatre. It is the operative procedure in the theatre which is so closely related to what the service fee is that you couldn’t say that there are otherwise ‘in respect of’. That’s fair enough. I can understand that point. I think you are on very strong ground on that aspect. It would be the counselling one that I think you would be on less strong ground with because it is possible to have counselling without the procedure. Presumably it is possible to have counselling and you’re not even necessarily thinking of the procedure.” 
        
       
       
      Shortly after this occurred the exchanges extracted by the Chief Justice in para [20] of his judgment, which I will not here repeat. 
       
      
    124 It is the appellant’s present contention that his Honour then ruled, as a matter of law, that the declarations were false. She draws this from the following passages attributed to his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second [issue] is the legal issue as to whether or not it is in fact legally permissible to charge separate fees for separate services provided. The view I have reached depends upon the relationship between the service provided and the item which is the medical aspect of it ...  
        In my view these are closely enough related to be said to be ‘in respect of’ in accordance with the Act 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    125 The Crown did not accept that this passage shows that a final ruling was made. The Chief Justice is of the same view. (See para [21].) Blackmore DCJ certainly appeared, in the final sentence, to be expressing a view, or even holding, that the counselling services and operating theatre services were services so closely associated with the pregnancy termination services that payments sought in respect of them (the counselling and theatre services) were payments sought in respect of the pregnancy termination services. 
     
      
    126 The passage has, to my mind, the flavour, at least, of a finding that the additional charges were impermissible. Implicit in this is a finding that the declarations that no payments had been sought were false. If that is what his Honour intended, it represents, in my view, for reasons that appear below, an error of law. 
     
      
    127 However, I respectfully agree with the Chief Justice that the passages do not amount to a ruling, and certainly not to a final ruling, to that effect. 
     
      
    128 Despite his Honour’s expressly reserving the opportunity to raise the matter again, no more was said on this issue. His Honour then directed the jury, relevantly, in the terms extracted in the judgment of Chief Justice in paras [27] and [28]. 
     
      
    129 Although the Crown did not accept that the view expressed by Blackmore DCJ on the third day of the trial was necessarily a final view, it did appear, in its written submissions, to accept that the “ruling of law” upon which Ground 1 is based was made. It sought to defend the ground of appeal by defending the correctness of the so-called “ruling of law”. In written submissions the Crown put: 
     
      
       
        
        “22 ... Clearly the additional fee charged by the appellant was a condition of the service provided, notwithstanding that any additional acts were not intrinsically part of ‘evacuation’ in item 35643. If the appellant’s argument is correct, a practitioner could render additional charges for consumables, nursing staff, scrubbing up, sterilising instruments or walking in the door of the theatre and still bulk bill. Clearly this would fly in the face of what was intended, as the appellant conceded in evidence in relation to the charges of general practitioners for consultations.  
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        30 The Crown submits that his Honour’s interpretation was correct.” (internal references omitted) 
        
       
       
      It may be assumed that the Crown treated, as does the Chief Justice, the directions in the summing up as a direction of law to the effect that the declarations were false. 
       
      
    130 In my opinion the relevant passages have to be read in the context of what had actually happened in the trial. They were references to the appellant’s evidence, to the Crown argument, and to the case advanced on behalf of the appellant. For that reason, I am unable to agree that the summing up amounts to a direction to the jury that, as a matter of law, the statements were false. At most, the summing up proceeds on the basis that the appellant herself had accepted that the statements were false. This was correct. She had accepted that the statements were false. In my opinion the directions do not go so far as to record a finding or direction that, as a matter of law, they were false. 
     
      
    131 I would therefore reject Ground 1 of the appeal. It is, in my opinion, based on a premise that is false. 
     
      
    132 Inherent in the approach taken by the parties was an acceptance that it was open to the trial judge to make a ruling, as a matter of law, on the falsity or otherwise of the declarations. This is the second fundamental misconception upon which Ground 1 was argued. It seems to me that whether a declaration is false or not is a matter of fact to be decided by the jury. In this case the issue has been masked by what amounts to a concession on the part of the appellant that the declarations were false. But in a case where, for example, the foundational facts were disputed, it is unlikely, in my opinion, that it would be open to a trial judge to make such a ruling. The trial judge would have available only the evidence given in the trial, of which the trial judge is not the arbiter of fact. 
     
      
    133 In this case, no evidence was given of what would ordinarily be encompassed in the provision of the pregnancy services constituting item number 35643. Whether counselling or operating services come within that item number as set out more fully in its description, is an issue of fact, which may, in some cases, be disputed, and the subject of evidence, probably expert evidence. The relationship between the additional services and the professional services the subject of the bulk-billing claim will vary from case to case. Many cases will involve issues of fact and degree. 
     
      
    134 It follows that I am unable to agree with the conclusions of the Chief Justice expressed in paras [59] – [62]. My view is that these are matters for determination by a jury. They are not matters of law to be determined either by the trial judge or by this Court. Since the falsity (or otherwise) of the declarations is a matter of fact, as to which the Crown bears the onus, a reasonable possibility that the declarations were not false would be sufficient to require an acquittal. It would, as is conventional in such circumstances, be necessary to direct the jury to that effect. 
     
      
    135 I would, however, for the reasons I have already given, reject Ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
    136 I am conscious that the views I have here expressed have been arrived at without the benefit of full argument. That is because I take an approach to the question that is fundamentally different from that taken by the parties on the appeal. 
     
      
    137 ADAMS J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, that Ground 2 should be upheld.  
     
      
    138 I agree with the Chief Justice’s conclusion and the reasons given for it that the question whether the appellant had made a false statement when she asserted that no payment had been sought “in respect of” the specified Item is a question of law. However, with respect, I do not agree that either the counselling or the theatre charges were made “in respect of” the Item in question.  
     
      
    139 The facts and regulatory context have been extensively set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. I do not intend to repeat that material, except to the extent that it will make it easier to follow my reasons. 140 The crucial facts, which are not in dispute, appear to me to be as follows:  
     
      
      (1) The doctor was paid $144.35, by way of direct-billing for a service described in the following terms –  
       
        
         
          
          “Item 35643 Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage not being a service to which Items 35639 or 35640 applies, including procedures to which Items 35626, 35627 or 35630 applies, where performed (Anaes. 17705=3B + 2T)”. 
          
         
        
       
       
      In lay terms, this is an abortion. 
       
       
      (2) Before any abortion was performed the patient was required to participate in what was described as “counselling”. That involved an interview with either an enrolled nurse or an assistant in nursing. The interview was structured by using a form which listed the following questions- 
       
       
        
        “(i) How do you feel about keeping your pregnancy? 
         
         (ii) How would it affect your present or future life? 
        
       
       (iii)  
      Have you considered any options other than TOP? 
       
        
        (iv) How do you feel after reaching a decision? 
         
        (v) Do you have any cultural or religious conflicts influencing your decision? 
         
        (vi) Does your partner know about this pregnancy and how does he feel about the pregnancy and the termination? 
         
        (vii) Have you used any contraception before hand and do you plan to use contraception in the future? 
         
        (viii) Are you aware of the risks and effects of the procedure? 
         
        (ix) If you decide to have the TOP you will need to have a discussion with the doctor about the TOP, the procedure and the risks involved again in detail”. 
        
       
       
      The nurses discussed any concerns the patient might have about the matters raised by the questionnaire. The patient’s answers to the questions were noted and she and the counsellor signed the counselling form. The questions were wide ranging and raised important personal issues but not medical ones. It was not suggested that what transpired in these interviews was not fairly described as counselling, nor was it any part of the Crown case that the nurses were not qualified, by their experience or otherwise to conduct them. It was not suggested that the counselling was a sham or was in any way inappropriate. 
       
       
      (3) Each patient was seen by the appellant before the procedure. This consultation was separately direct-billed. It was an essential prerequisite for the procedure. The Crown did not suggest that the appellant was not entitled to charge for this consultation. 
       
       
      (4) The procedures were undertaken in an operating theatre situated in part of the premises occupied by Dr Sood’s practice. 
       
       
      (5). The charges varied depending on the gestation period, eg the fee was increased by $20 if the period was greater than 12 weeks but less than 14 weeks and increased again if greater than 16 weeks and again if greater than 18 weeks and so on. The fee was also greater if the procedure was undertaken on a weekend as distinct from a weekday. 
       
       
      (6) The charges were made for “counselling and theatre” with no distinct amount attributed to each element. 
       
       
      (7) The appellant signed claim forms asserting, “no payments have been sought from any person in respect of the professional services specified in the attached assignment forms”. 
       
      
    141 Some additional observations should be made about these facts. First, there was no expert (or, for that matter, other) evidence called by the Crown as to the nature and immediate concomitants of the procedure itself. It appeared that it was conducted under anaesthetic but whether general or otherwise was not stated. There was no evidence as to whether such procedures must be or should be performed in an operating theatre as distinct from the doctor’s consulting room. There was no evidence as to whether, or the extent, of any difference in procedures or personnel necessary or desirable to be present (except for the anaesthetist) in conducting such procedure if it took place in a theatre or the consulting room. The Item itself made no reference to the place at which or the conditions under which the procedure should or could be performed. In this respect it differed from many other Items concerning professional attendances. 
     
      
    142 The only other source of evidence as to the distinctions between procedures carried out in a consulting room and an operating theatre was the appellant. Her evidence, in substance, was that there were a number of substantial differences. The Crown did not seek – indeed, was not in a position to do so – to contradict her evidence on this point. The Crown simply argued that the charge for performing the procedure in a theatre was a payment sought in respect of the Item. 
     
      
    143 The appellant said that additional charge “was to run the theatre and provide…counselling service”. She said that “running a theatre” involved, “lots of things: we need different gases, anaesthetic appliances; we need medications, injections, disposables, instruments and cleaning material, sheets and drinks, so many things”. The appellant also said –  
     
      
       
        
        “… you cannot run a theatre properly or provide the service properly in the $140 Medicare gives you…You could maybe do Third World work, somewhere where you cut short on services. You could not afford to pay fully registered nurses, could not afford to keep up to the standard of your sterilisation, all the services, you couldn’t do it with $140 if you had to run a practice.” 
        
       
       
      In cross examination the appellant also mentioned tubing, the provision of anaesthesics, an autoclave for sterilisation as well as the substantial size of the theatre itself.  
       
      
    144 The Crown prosecutor did not dispute this evidence or cross-examine the appellant to suggest that what she said was false, although he asked the jury, in effect, to disbelieve her upon a basis that, to my mind, was quite spurious. 
     
      
    145 In cross-examination the prosecutor asked the appellant about costs that a general practitioner might have. The appellant replied –  
     
      
       
        
        “We are talking of two entirely different sorts of situations, different sort of requirements and procedures, different level of staff required. They are entirely different. A GP has a nurse, he has one nurse sitting in a treatment room, could be just an enrolled nurse. He cannot sedate patients and observe, he won’t need anaesthetists or the equipment to do that. We had gases to run a theatre. We had oxygen suction pipes in all the walls and these led to every bed. General practitioners do not need that. In the medical centre we have a pulse ovymetre, you only have to put your finger on that to read the pulse. That costs $600.” 
        
       
      
    146 The appellant explained the increased charge for longer gestation periods in this way –  
     
      
       
        
        “Basically, the theatre charges I explained earlier consisted of many things. For a patient 8 weeks pregnant compared to a patient 14 weeks pregnant we would have to use a lot of extra theatre time, extra medication, everything involved in the procedure would be many folds(ie, times) more than what 8 week terminations would be. That is why we charge extra”. 
        
       
      
    147 The appellant conceded that on the view of the law taken by the Health Insurance Commission she had indeed charged for services “in respect of” the procedure described in Item 35643. However, she maintained throughout her evidence that the additional charges were not “for the procedure which Medicare is paying us”, stating this repeatedly in answer to attempts by the Crown prosecutor – quite wrongly in my view – to extract from her what could only amount to an opinion about the interpretation of the law and its application to the facts.  
     
      
    148 In my view the concession was not an admission of any relevant fact. Even accepting the question whether the charges were “in respect of” Item 35643 is one of fact, it was not a fact capable of being proved by being admitted by an answer in cross-examination. It was an objective fact requiring determination by the jury. The “admission” was no more than the appellant’s opinion, and was substantially qualified. The nature of the necessary relationship between the additional charge and the Item to make the former charge “in respect of” the Item was not of a kind as to which the opinion of a witness could be asked. In this respect the appellant was merely a witness. I do not say that a formal admission could not be made under s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 but this is a completely different matter. In respect to this issue, no light is shed by the passage in R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 at 671, to which the Crown referred. 
     
      
    The meaning of “in respect of”149 If I may respectively say so, the Chief Justice is right to draw attention to the ubiquity in the Act of the phrase “in respect of a professional service”. However, in each case the phrase could have substituted for it the word “for” without any loss of syntactical correctness. Is there a loss of referential meaning? The answer would be “yes” only if the underlying assumption is that more was intended to be covered than would be covered by the word “for”. Aside from the phrase itself, the Act does not, in my respectful view, suggest the need for wider reference. The difficulty in accepting that the phrase itself is intended to reflect a wider reference is that it entails considerable uncertainty in a context where precision of scope if of considerable importance.  
     
      
    150 The striking characteristic of the Table prescribed in the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2005 is the clinical and minute precision in which each service (of which there are well over 50,000) is described.151 Although the Regulations comprise a distinct statutory instrument, it forms part of a detailed, comprehensive scheme. In my respectful opinion, the acceptance of the Crown submission would, in effect, surround each item with a penumbra of indeterminate meaning inconsistent with the structure of the legislative scheme and unfair to the medical practitioners attempting to work within its boundaries.  
     
      
    152 I do not accept that the legislature intended to place doctors in the position where a not unreasonable interpretation of the Act leads them to make a claim which ex post facto a judge (or, for that matter, a jury) will find to be wrong and render them liable to criminal prosecution. The mere fact that the prosecution must prove dishonesty as an additional element is no answer to this point. The question of interpretation is debatable and the fact that a doctor makes a claim, even if he or she thinks it might not be justifiable but upon an available interpretation of the Act and the Regulation, should not render him or her liable to prosecution.153 The terms of the Department’s own publication advising doctor’s how to apply the Medical Benefits Schedule in respect of billing procedures. Paragraph 7.5.2 states –  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        7.5.2 
         If a medical practitioner direct-bills, he/she undertakes to accept the relevant Medicare benefit as full payment  
        for the service 
        . Additional charges  
        for that service 
         (irrespective of the purpose or title of the charge) cannot be raised against the payment, with the exception of certain vaccines (see paragraph 7.5.4)”. [My italics.] 
        
       
      
    154 I think it is also worth noting that the fee payable at the time for a termination under Item 35643 was $144.35. Of course, the medical issues become more difficult the longer the gestation period. It cannot be doubted that termination of pregnancy by surgical intervention requires a high level of skill and experience. To my mind the modesty of the Medicare fee strongly suggests that it applies only to undertaking the specific matters described in the Item. 
     
      
    155 The phrase “in respect of” is capable of involving a wide range of circumstances focussed on a particular subject but not limited to that act or event. It can also simply mean “for”. Where it is intended to refer to or cover more than simply the specifically described subject, other commonly used phrases are, however, much more apt. The most obvious are “in relation to” or “in connection with”. These phrases themselves suggest that there exist a penumbra of circumstances linked to the subject matter which it is also intended to cover by the description of the subject matter. That these terms are not used in a situation which (if the Crown contention be correct) calls for a clear indication that connected services are intended to be covered although not specifically described (and this against a threat of criminal prosecution) is a clear signal, to my mind, that no such wider reference is intended. 
     
      
    156 It follows that Item 35643 does not include counselling services and the fact that the appellant would not perform the procedure unless the patient had undergone counselling session is irrelevant. The position of the theatre fee is not so clear. However, the provision of theatre facilities in which the service is performed is not the provision of the service. This might suggest that by parity of reasoning a doctor is entitled to charge, for example, for use of the consulting room where, say, the procedure is undertaken. There are several answers to this suggestion. It seems obvious that the Item necessarily assumes that the procedure will take place in an appropriate place and that provision of such a place is necessarily part of the service itself. But the assumed place is that which is sufficient to satisfy accepted medical standards of care. The only evidence bearing on this point came from the appellant and was inconclusive. The clear thrust of it, however, was that the standard of care was significantly greater than the minimum necessary to satisfy relevant standards. If a doctor charged for the use of his or her consulting room, it would, it seems to me, be obvious that the real nature such a charge was that it paid for the general costs of running the doctor’s practice. The Item is predicated upon the existence of appropriate means for carrying it out. The presence of those means is thus part of the provision of the service. Charging for them is thus a charge for the service. Where more than that minimum standard is provided, it falls outside the assumption inherent in the Item. Charging for that extra level of safety is thus not within the Item. 
     
      
       
      
    157 I acknowledge that this reasoning is not entirely convincing. This, however, is merely a function of the lack of clarity of the language of the Act. No entirely satisfactory interpretation of the Act is as it seems to me, available. However, I have formed the view – not without significant wavering – that the interpretation I respectfully propose has the advantage of greater (though not complete) certainty than that proposed by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
       
      New Trial 
       
      
    158 It follows that I am of the opinion that the appellant should be acquitted and, accordingly, no order for a new trial should be made. 
     
      
    159 Simpson J has concluded that the question whether the counselling and theatre fees were charges in respect of Item 35643 is one of fact and, hence, for the jury and not the judge to determine.  
     
      
    160 If this were so, a direction would be required to the effect that, if it were reasonably possible that the charges for neither counselling and use of the theatre were in respect of Item 35643, the appellant must be acquitted. In my view, it is impossible rationally to exclude such a reasonable possibility. The circumstances are inherently and irreducibly ambiguous. Even if this were not so as a general proposition, upon the analysis of the evidentiary position explained in Simpson J’s judgment, the state of the evidence called by the Crown in the trial was such that no conclusion adverse to the appellant was open on the evidence. The calling of expert evidence in an attempt to fill the substantial evidentiary gap would represent to my mind such a major change in the Crown case as to make it inappropriate to order a new trial. The Crown went to trial relying on no expert evidence at all. That was plainly a deliberate forensic decision. The appellant gave evidence in answer to that case. The Crown urged a view of the law which – if Simpson J be correct – was wrong. The Crown was content with the way the matter was put to the jury. I do not consider that, having made these tactical forensic decisions, the Crown should now be permitted to mount a completely different trial. 
     
      
    161 Accordingly, if I am wrong about the interpretation of the Act and Simpson J’s analysis be correct, this Court should not order a new trial.

     REGINA v Linard SHAMOUIL 
      
     
     
      
      The Respondent is to stand trial for offences related to the shooting of Mr Daniel Dawood on 17 July 2004. Immediately following the shooting, the victim provided the police with details of the assailant, and on 5 August 2005 identified the Respondent in a photo-board identification. A month later, the victim provided police with a statement retracting his earlier identification, to the effect that he was unable to identify his assailant. The victim maintained this position on the  
      voir dire 
      . 
       
       
      In addition to the victim’s identification evidence, the Crown case involved: evidence of the relationship between the victim, the Respondent, and a former girlfriend of the Respondent; evidence of telephone calls made to the victim from a mobile telephone linked to the Respondent; evidence that the shooter identified himself by the Respondent’s first name; the Respondent’s access to a vehicle fitting the description of the vehicle from which the shooter alighted; and identification evidence from the victim’s cousin.  
       
       
      In a judgement of 23 November 2005, Maguire DCJ excluded the evidence of the photo-board identification on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, pursuant to s137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995.  
       
       
      The Crown appealed to this Court pursuant to s5F(3A) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912 on two bases. First, that his Honour had wrongly considered the reliability of the identification evidence when determining its probative value. Secondly, that his Honour had failed to identify any unfair prejudice. The Respondent contended that the evidence caused unfair prejudice because of the danger that the jury might speculate about the victim’s motive for retracting the identification, and the danger that the jury might convict on the basis of mistaken identification evidence.  
       
       
      HELD 
       
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing 
       
       
      Appeals under s5F(3A) 
       
       
      1 The Court’s jurisdiction to hear an appeal under s5F(3A) rests upon the Court being satisfied by the Crown that the excluded evidence substantially weakens the Crown case. [29]–[30], [81], [82] 
       
       
        
        R v NKS  
        [2004] NSWCCA 144;  
        R v Lameri  
        [2004] NSWCCA 217;  
        R v Milakovic  
        [2004] NSWCCA 199 followed. 
        
       
       
      2 A Crown case can be “substantially weakened”, even if it is strong, by the exclusion of evidence of cogency or force. [37], [81], [82] 
       
       
      3 When considering the capacity of evidence to “substantially weaken” the Crown case, it is not appropriate to take into account the weight that a jury might attach to the evidence – the evidence is to be considered on the assumption that it is accepted by the jury. [39]–[40], [81], [82] 
       
       
      4 The exclusion of the photo-board identification evidence substantially weakened the Crown case. Even if it were appropriate to consider the weight that a jury might attach to the evidence, its exclusion would still have such an effect. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. [36]–[37], [41], [46], [81], [82] 
       
       
      Assessment of Probative Value 
       
       
      5 When considering the probative value of evidence, the evidence is to be considered on the assumption that it is accepted. Matters of reliability will only rarely be relevant to this assessment. [51]–[65], [81], [82]

        (1990) 171 CLR 207 referred to. 
        
       
       
      6 His Honour erred by considering the credibility of the identification evidence when determining its probative value. [67]–[68], [81], [82] 
       
       
      Unfair Prejudice 
       
       
      7 His Honour did not identify any respect in which the evidence would cause unfair prejudice. [76], [81], [82]

        (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 referred to. 
        
       
       
      8 Any unfair prejudice arising from dangers associated with identification evidence could be cured with a warning. His Honour made no reference to the possibility of a warning under s165 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . The effect of such a warning should be taken into account. [74], [77], [81], [82] 
       
       
      9 No unfair prejudice arose from the possibility that the jury might speculate about the victim’s motivation for retracting the identification. [78], [81], [82]

     REGINA v Linard SHAMOUIL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Crown. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “5F(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.” 
        
       
      
    2 In a judgment of 23 November 2005 Judge Maguire excluded evidence of a photo board identification of the Respondent by the victim of an alleged offence. The Respondent stands charged with one count of shooting with intent to murder contrary to s29 of the Crimes Act 1900 with an alternative count of malicious shooting with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s33 of that Act. 
     
      
    3 The victim, Mr Daniel Dawood, had identified the Respondent in the course of a photo identification. He subsequently withdrew his identification in circumstances which I will hereinafter set out. 
     
      
    4 Maguire DCJ excluded the evidence on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act 1995. The Crown appeals from this decision and asserts that the ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution case. The Respondent has put in issue the jurisdictional question of whether or not the exclusion does eliminate or substantially weaken the prosecution case. It is, accordingly, necessary to outline the nature of the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    5 On 17 July 2004 the complainant, Daniel Dawood, was shot outside his home. The main issue in the trial is whether the Respondent was the shooter. 
     
      
    6 The Crown case was that the Respondent had an intermittent relationship with a young woman by the name of Nahrain Zaya. The Respondent was jealous of any male attention enjoyed by Ms Zaya. The complainant was introduced to Ms Zaya and expressed some interest in her. 
     
      
    7 At about 4.00pm on Saturday 17 July 2004, the complainant received a call on his mobile telephone from a male who identified himself as “John”. “John” said he was Ms Zaya’s cousin and wanted to know what the complainant’s intentions were. He wanted to discuss the matter with the complainant and asked for his address (which the complainant provided). 
     
      
    8 The complainant received a further telephone call while he was at home having an early dinner with his family. Call charge records indicate that this call was made at 5.06pm from mobile telephone number 0402592652. The complainant identified the voice as being the same as the earlier caller who had identified himself as “John”. The caller asked where the complainant was. The complainant said he was at home. The caller told the complainant to go outside. The complainant walked outside, still with the mobile telephone, and saw a green car approach the front yard of his home. The green car stopped about 3-4 metres away from the complainant. The passenger got out of the car and said to the complainant, “Is this Daniel?”. The complainant said he was. The passenger then said what sounded like “I’m Leonard” and started shooting at the complainant. The complainant was shot in the foot and the thigh. The passenger got back into the green car, which sped away. The complainant’s family raced outside at the sound of gunfire. When the complainant’s brother Bobo asked the complainant who did this to him, the complainant said, “It was Leonard”. The complainant made a similar statement to his sister Norma and, on the way to the hospital, the complainant also told his cousin, Aidy Tiary, that the shooter identified himself as “Leonard”. 
     
      
    9 The complainant gave a detailed description of the shooter to police in a statement dated 19 July 2004. The Respondent was arrested on 30 July 2004 but declined to participate in an identification parade. 
     
      
    10 On 5 August 2004 the complainant took part in a photographic identification procedure. This procedure was recorded by audio-videotape. The complainant was shown a photo board containing 20 photographs. He was asked if he could identify any person, pointed to number 7 on the photo board (a photograph of the Respondent), and said “I have only seen him the guy only the time he shot me on the 17 July”. In a statement of the same date, the complainant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a paper with twenty pictures. I saw the guy that shot me in the pictures. Its number seven [sic]. I am one hundred percent its him. I know its him because of his face. I recognised around his mouth. I imagined a white hat on his head and I could tell that was the person who shot me.” 
        
       
      
    11 However, on 9 September 2004 the complainant attended the office of a private solicitor and made a statement retracting his identification of the Respondent as the shooter. In this statement, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “6 I am making this statement of my own free will as I believe I have not accurately identified my assailant. I believe I have made a mistake. I could not at the time, nor could I now positively identify my assailant. I attempted to do so but feel uneasy that I am mistaken. 
        
       
       
        
        7 I do not know and have never known Linard Shamouil. 
        
       
       
        
        8. I was first questioned by police at Liverpool Hospital when I recall being heavily medicated by morphine. I do not recall any of the conversations with the police and had difficulty for a number of days even identifying members of my own family.  
        
       
       
        
        9. I cannot deny it but I cannot recall telling police the assailant said to me, ‘I’m Linard’.  
        
       
       
        
        10. I cannot recall anything I told police while in hospital. I do not know Linard Shamouil and I cannot recall any physical details of the assailant.  
        
       
       
        
        11. I feel guilty to have identified a photograph of my assailant when at the time and to this day I genuinely cannot recall whether the person depicted in the photograph was my assailant. 
        
       
       
        
        12 I was nervous at Wetherill Park Police Station, concerned about myself, my parents and getting the matter resolved. However, I think it was nerves that led me to selecting a photograph of my assailant when at the time, as now, I was unsure.” 
        
       
      
    12 The complainant maintained this position when he gave evidence in the committal proceedings and in the voir dire. 
     
      
    13 In response to an inquiry from the Court, the Crown identified the evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish the offence in addition to the identification evidence of Daniel Dawood. The evidence is circumstantial and consisted of the following: 
     
      
    · The background relationship between the relevant parties: the complainant, the Respondent and Nahrain Zaya. 
     
      
    · Telephone calls received by the complainant prior to the shooting. 
     
      
    · The shooter’s identification of himself as “Leonard”. 
     
      
    · The Respondent’s access to a vehicle fitting the description of the vehicle from which the shooter alighted. 
     
      
    · Identification evidence from the complainant’s cousin. 
     
      
    14 With respect to the relationship between the Respondent and Ms Zaya the evidence suggests that the relationship was characterised by jealousy and that the complainant had demonstrated some interest in Ms Zaya.  
     
      
    15 Telephone records confirm the occasions on which calls were made amongst the three persons, Ms Zaya, Mr Dawood and Mr Shamouil. The content of some of these telephone calls has been referred to above. The calls were made from a mobile phone which can be connected to the Respondent. He gave the number to Ms Zaya, and to the police on an unrelated occasion. 
     
      
    16 There is hearsay evidence that Mr Darwood said that the shooter identified himself as “Leonard”. Mr Darwood also gave a detailed description of his assailant that is at least consistent with the appearance of the Respondent. The evidence linking the Respondent to a green vehicle is to the effect that one of the Respondent’s aunts owns such a vehicle. 
     
      
    17 The other identification by the complainant’s cousin is in the form of a general description of the passenger in the vehicle. That witness said that he was woken by gunshots, that he was in shock and that it was dark. He admitted, in cross-examination, that he may have been mistaken. He did identify the Respondent from a photograph, by using the expression that he “looks familiar”. 
     
      
    18 One matter that arose was the different accounts given by Mr Dawood as to whether or not he had seen the Respondent before the day of the incident. 
     
      
    19 During the course of the photographic identification when Mr Dawood identified the Respondent he was asked “Where you recognise the person from?” and answered “From here”. When he was further asked where he had seen him before he replied: “I’ve never seen him. I’ve only seem him like the time he shot me” and on the second occasion when he was asked the same question said: “I don’t know him. I’ve never seen him … I’ve only seen him, the guy, only the time he shot me on 17 July”. 
     
      
    20 After the photo-board identification, Mr Dawood made a statement, the relevant part of which I have already set out. In that statement, no mention was made of whether the complainant had seen his assailant before. 
     
      
    21 I have already set out part of the typed statement of his subsequent retraction. I repeat the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. I do not know and have never known Linard Shamouil. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        10. … I do not know Linard Shamouil and I cannot recall any physical details of the assailant.” 
        
       
      
    22 When interviewed in hospital on the night of the shooting, the victim told a police officer that he had seen the assailant at Fairfield “a long time ago”. In the course of the committal hearing Mr Dawood indicated that he had seen Linard “once or twice” at Fairfield. Daniel Dawood’s brother referred to a conversation that occurred at hospital shortly after the shooting in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Constable Ferns let me see Danny in the hospital. I went and say to Danny in Assyrian, ‘Who did this shit.’ Danny say back to me in Assyrian, ‘His name is Linard. I don’t know him. I never seen him before. He come to the house in the green car and say to me when I was out the front, ‘Are you Danny?’ I said, ‘Yes I am Danny.’ Then he said, ‘I am Linard.’ Then he shot me.” 
        
       
      
    23 These statements were not consistent with his assertions that he had never seen the Respondent before the night of the attack. 
     
      
       
      Trial Judge’s Reasons 
       
      
    24 In the course of his judgment in which he rejected the evidence under s137 of the Evidence Act Maguire DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of Daniel Dawood does not amount to the whole of the Crown case, that is if it is excluded, the Crown case does not collapse absolutely. However it is central to the Crown case and is therefore important that the application I am entertaining be considered with some care.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour set out the sequence of events with respect to the statements made by Mr Dawood setting out its content, the videotape of the identification, the further written statement and the statement made by way of retraction to which he had adhered at the committal. 
     
      
    26 His Honour referred to s137 of the Evidence Act and to the definition of “probative value” in the dictionary. He gave his reasons for rejecting the evidence in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of the complainant is clearly relevant. However, it is abundantly clear that the complainant has either lied or made inexplicable mistakes about significant matters. Whether he had or had not previously seen the accused is central to the issue of identification. There is, as I perceive it, a real risk that the complainant was, at the photo identification exercise, doing no more than identifying the man in photo 7 as a man that he had seen on one or two occasions prior to 17 July 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        His use of the name ‘Linard’ to police and others on the same date is clearly capable of being a mere repetition of the name offered to him by the gunman. 
        
       
       
        
        History is full of unreliable identification evidence which has been admitted into evidence and accepted by juries, only to be brought undone later. Mr Brady, in the course of his submissions today said something to this effect, that juries can be seduced by unreliable identification evidence, and there is no doubt that that has happened in cases in the past. 
        
       
       
        
        The risk of that happening here presents, in my view, a real danger of unfair prejudice, which, in my view, outweighs the probative value of the evidence sought to be admitted. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not have to decide any questions of fact in relation to this matter, but as I have said, it appears to me that arguably the complainant was lying, or was very seriously mistaken, about some of the matters central to this question of identification, and to allow, after his retraction, the bare bones of what is left to go to the jury, seems to me to reduce the probative value of the evidence to the point where the risk of an invalid conviction would amount to unfair prejudice which would outweigh the residual probative value of the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Accordingly, I reject the evidence at hand.” 
        
       
       
      The s5F(3A) Test 
       
      
    27 The Appellant contends that the ruling excluding the evidence substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. The Respondent contends that that is not so. This constitutes a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
     
      
    28 Section 5F(3A) was introduced by the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2003. The pre-existing right of appeal by the Crown in s5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has been interpreted so as not to extend to rulings which merely weaken but do not destroy the Crown case. 
     
      
    29 In accordance with the authorities, this Court must assess the Crown case in order to determine whether or not the excluded evidence substantially weakens it. (See e.g. R v NKS [2004] NSWCCA 144 at [17]; R v Lameri [2004] NSWCCA 217 at [35]-[36]; R v Milakovic [2004] NSWCCA 199 at [10] and [31].) 
     
      
    30 The Crown bears the onus of establishing that the exclusion of the evidence substantially weakens its case.  
     
      
    31 Without the identification evidence of Dawood the Crown submits that it would be left with a weak circumstantial case and no direct evidence. It submits that the case including the direct evidence is more compelling and, indeed, a powerful one. On this basis it submits that the Crown case is “substantially weakened”. 
     
      
    32 The Respondent submits that the identification evidence is so weak that its exclusion cannot be said to substantially weaken the prosecution case. In particular, he challenges the Crown submission that the complainant’s description was generally consistent with the appearance of the Respondent. Further, he says that there is no evidence of a number of matters asserted by the complainant in this description; including that he was about 170-175cms tall, that he was skinny, that he had pimples on his cheek, that he had diamond stud earrings in both ears, that he had a silver chain with a silver cross about 10cms long, and the description of his clothes. Furthermore, although it was consistent with the other evidence that Mr Dawood identified his assailant as having a thin goatee beard, he failed to mention the Respondent’s moustache. Finally, there was inconsistency in that Mr Dawood suggested that the assailant was wearing a white cap, whereas Mr Tiary said he was wearing a black beanie.  
     
      
    33 With respect to the Crown’s submission that without the identification evidence it would be left with a weak circumstantial case and no direct evidence, the Respondent notes that the Crown would still have the complainant’s description of his assailant which, to some degree, is consistent with other evidence in a number of respects including a statement that he looked Assyrian, that he had olive skin, that he was 20-21 years old and had a thin goatee beard. 
     
      
    34 The Respondent also submits that the complainant’s photographic identification is made considerably weaker by his later retraction and by the significant inconsistencies in his statements and evidence about whether he had previously seen his assailant. The reduction in the probative value of the evidence is such that its exclusion, the Respondent submits, would not substantially weaken the Crown case. 
     
      
    35 I have set out the nature of the Crown case above together with the evidence, other than the photo identification evidence that remains to be considered by the jury. This includes, particularly, the evidence about the relationship between the accused and Ms Zaya and between the complainant and Ms Zaya; the evidence of the telephone calls prior to the shooting and records associating those calls with a mobile telephone used by the accused; the hearsay evidence of the shooter’s self-identification as “Leonard”; the Respondent’s access to a car matching the description of the car; and Mr Dawood’s description of his assailant. 
     
      
    36 In the passage from the judgment of Maguire DCJ, which I have quoted above, his Honour identified the photo identification as “central to the Crown case”. I agree. In its absence the Crown has a significantly weaker circumstantial case with respect to the critical issue of whether the Respondent was the shooter.  
     
      
    37 The Respondent’s submission which directs attention to the remaining Crown evidence – telephone, car, relationship, the name “Leonard” – is a case that is of some substance. However, a clear forceful and unhesitating identification on the first occasion by the victim is evidence of particular force. Its absence will, in my opinion, “substantially weaken” the Crown case. Even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed, may still be ‘substantially weakened’, if evidence of cogency or force is withheld. 
     
      
    38 As noted above, counsel for the Respondent submitted that the evidence of identification was itself so weak that its absence could not be said to substantially weaken the Crown case. In my opinion, this approach is not appropriate. 
     
      
    39 The issue is similar to that which arises when determining the probative value of evidence in the context of the application of s137 of the Evidence Act, to which I will refer below. The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to “the prosecution’s case”, to be considered as a “case”. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown’s evidence. 
     
      
    40 This Court should determine whether or not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence “substantially weakens” the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. It is not desirable for this Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations. 
     
      
    41 Even if I were of a different view, and of the opinion that it was open to assess the evidence from the point of view of the weight likely to be attributed to it by a jury, in view of the subsequent retraction of the identification and the different versions about the victim’s prior knowledge of the Respondent, I would still have concluded that the Crown case was substantially weakened.  
     
      
    42 I have viewed the videotape of the photo identification and read the statements of the witness. They have a stamp of truth about them and are delivered with confidence. In particular, his unhesitating identification of the Respondent, and the subsequent detailed description of the assailant’s appearance, strongly suggests that Mr Dawood had a clear and quite firm opinion about who the assailant was and what he looked like. A jury, properly instructed, could well take the view that the attempt to retract the identification evidence was unconvincing and a manifestation of either a threat of reprisals or of a desire, within a close knit ethnic community, to resolve matters amongst themselves, without the interference of the State.  
     
      
    43 That the latter is the more likely is suggested by the followed extract from the victim’s evidence at committal: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What mistake had you made? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because I made that statement against him and he’s like my blood. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say like your blood, what does that mean? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It means he’s Assyrian like me. It’s my blood. I done a mistake. I made a mistake and I done the statement against him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that the mistake that you are referring about? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    44 Either of the alternative possibilities represents a challenge to the administration of criminal justice in this State, which this Court should be very slow to tolerate in any manner. 
     
      
    45 Insofar as it may be permissible for this Court to form a view about the strength of the evidence, notwithstanding the attempt to retract it, in my opinion the excluded evidence is of force and significantly enhanced the Crown case.  
     
      
    46 Jurisdiction under s5F(3A) is established. 
     
      
       
      The Probative Value Issue 
       
      
    47 Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    48 The words “probative value” are defined in the dictionary as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    49 Before the Evidence Act the Christie discretion to exclude evidence at common law for which s137 is a replacement, did not involve considerations of reliability of the evidence.  
     
      
    50 As Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Newman and Ireland JJ agreed, said in R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 65-66: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was for the jury, and not for the trial judge, to determine the factual issues at the trial. Applying the ordinary tests, there was clearly a case to go to the jury based upon the evidence in chief of Mrs McHugh which (if that evidence were accepted) was a strong one, and it was for the jury to determine which parts of her evidence they accepted and which parts they rejected. The power of the trial judge to exclude evidence in accordance with the  
        Christie  
        discretion does not permit the judge, in assessing what its probative value is, to determine whether the jury should or should not accept the evidence of the witness upon which the Crown case depends. The trial judge can only exclude the evidence of such a witness where, taken at its highest, its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect; whereas this Court may use its supervisory powers to set aside a verdict where, the issue having been left to the jury, this Court is satisfied – on the whole of the evidence – that the jury ought nevertheless have had a reasonable doubt.” [Footnotes omitted] 
        
       
      
    51 After the enactment of s137, the same approach was taken in R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397 at 403 and R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [255]-[256], in both of which the formulation from R v Carusi was expressly adopted, i.e. the evidence must be “taken at its highest” in order to determine its probative value. 
     
      
    52 Other views have been expressed in the authorities on this issue.  
     
      
    53 Consistently with the pre Evidence Act position, in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96 at [60], Gaudron J concluded that the dictionary definition of “probative value” must have read into it an assumption that the evidence would be accepted on the basis that “evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue only if it is accepted”. 
     
      
    54 A contrary view was taken by McHugh JA in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [86] where his Honour said that the assessment required by the definition of probative value “would necessarily involve considerations of reliability”. 
     
      
    55 In R v Rahme [2004] NSWCCA 233 James J at [201]-[202], with whom Sully J agreed at [65], adopted the approach of Gaudron J. However, Hulme J at [217]-[223] adopted the approach of McHugh J. 
     
      
    56 That there may be some, albeit limited, circumstances in which credibility and reliability will be taken into account when determining probative value was indicated by Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 in which evidence of flight was sought to be excluded under s137. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[43] … I am satisfied that it is not the role of a trial judge in NSW, under the  
        Evidence Act 
        , to make a finding of fact about the actual reasons for flight where such evidence is given on behalf of the Crown. That remains the province of the jury. The role of the judge in NSW, at least post-1995, is merely to determine the relative probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice that might result. In saying this, I do not mean to lay down a blanket rule that, in considering evidence on a voir dire in which the issue is the admissibility of evidence having regard to s137, there is never any room for findings concerning credibility. There will be occasions when an assessment of the credibility of the evidence will be inextricably entwined with the balancing process. That means that particular caution must be exercised to ensure that the balancing exercise is not confused with the assessment of credibility, a task committed to the jury. There may, for example, be occasions on which the accused’s response is so preposterous as to give rise to the conclusion that it could be accepted by no reasonable jury. The credibility exercise, in those circumstances, is to determine whether the evidence given by (or on behalf of) the accused is capable of belief by the jury. If it is, then its prejudicial effect must be considered. If it is not, then the balancing exercise may well result in an answer favourable to the Crown. That is essentially because any prejudice arising to an accused from putting a preposterous explanation to the jury would not be unfair prejudice.” 
        
       
      
    57 A similar approach is evident in the reasoning of Adams J, with whom I and Sully J agreed in R v AB [2001] NSWCCA 496. That case involved the admission of tendency evidence under s101 of the Evidence Act, where the question is whether or not “the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have”. In that context Adams J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘[17] … In my view, the probative value of that evidence was high in the circumstances of this case, upon the assumption, of course, that it was true, but that must be necessarily the assumption with which s 101 is concerned.” 
        
       
      
    58 This difference in approach in the authorities referred to above turned, in large measure, on the weight, if any, to be given to the omission of the words ‘if the evidence were accepted’, from the definition of “probative value”. Such words appear in the otherwise almost identical formulation in the definition of relevance of evidence in s55(1). I note, further, that in s55 the words “directly or indirectly” expressly qualify the phrase “rationally affect”. They do not appear in the definition of probative value. 
     
      
    59 There is at least one reason why the words that appear in s55 would not be appropriate in the definition of “probative value”. The latter definition has work to do in s103, the exception to the credibility rule. Whether cross-examination on credit has “substantial probative value” within s103(1) does not invite consideration of ‘acceptance’ of the evidence proposed to be used as part of an attack on credit. Nor does it invite consideration of whether the ‘effect’ on “the assessment” is ‘direct or indirect’. 
     
      
    60 The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach. 
     
      
    61 In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …”. The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has “probative value”, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    62 This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must “rationally affect” the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in Adam supra, a “test” of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight. 
     
      
    63 There will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in Cook supra, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHugh J’s observations in Papakosmas that “considerations of reliability are necessarily involved” have application. 
     
      
    64 To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible “basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function”. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137. 
     
      
    65 This Court should be very slow to conclude that it was the intention of Parliament in enacting the Evidence Act to alter the fundamental relationship between the judge and jury in a criminal trial in the manner suggested. Such a change would occur on each occasion that “probative value” falls to be assessed by the trial judge including: tendency and coincidence evidence (s97(1)(b), s98(1)(b), s101(2)); cross-examination on credit (s103(1)); the comparative weight with misleading, confusing, or time wasting effects (s135(b) and (c)); and the comparative weight with unfair prejudice (s135(a), s137). 
     
      
    66 I have set out above his Honour’s reasoning in this respect. It appears to me to be clear that his Honour determined the probative value of the evidence by referring to the general unreliability of identification evidence and the possibility of a displacement effect which, if the complainant had in fact seen the Respondent on those two occasions in Fairfield, would have been operative in the present case.  
     
      
    67 Furthermore, his Honour plainly took into account issues of credibility when he said, as quoted above: “…. It appears to me that arguably the complainant was lying, or was very seriously mistaken, about some of the matters central to this question of identification”. In this passage his Honour does not determine whether the “deception” was about the original identification or on the occasion of the subsequent withdrawal. The fact that his Honour, after saying he did not have to “decide any questions of fact”, applied a test of the mere ‘arguability’ of the deficiencies in the credit of the witness, suggests that his Honour was applying a very low order test.  
     
      
    68 On any view, in these respects, his Honour did not apply the test established by the authorities in this Court, as set out above. 
     
      
    69 The appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
       
      The Unfair Prejudice Issue 
       
      
    70 The Appellant submits that his Honour failed to identify any unfair prejudice and accordingly, that the process by which he made the judgment under s137 miscarried.  
     
      
    71 Like other sections of the Evidence Act, s137 calls upon a judge to compare essentially incommensurable considerations: probative value on the one hand and unfair prejudice on the other. As Justice Scalia once put it, this is like asking “whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy”. (Bendix Autolite Corp v Midwesco Enterprises Inc, 486 US 888 (1988) at 897). Nevertheless, this is a task that judges are often called upon to perform. 
     
      
    72 There is now a considerable body of case law in this Court which emphasises the fact that the assessment of this element requires any prejudice to be unfair. There must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way and that that risk will exist notwithstanding the proper directions which it should be assumed the Court will give. (See e.g. R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 151.) (I do not need to refer to the reasoning in some cases that procedural prejudice may be sufficient.) 
     
      
    73 To use the test of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [51]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is only when the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens the prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or contents of the evidence may influence the jury or divert the jurors from their task.”

      [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252].) 
       
      
    74 In his reasons for judgment that I have extracted above, his Honour made reference to the possibility of a displacement effect, by reason of the evidence that the victim may have seen the assailant at Fairfield on one or two occasions. His Honour said that “juries can be seduced by unreliable identification evidence”. It was this which his Honour identified as constituting the “real danger of unfair prejudice”. In this analysis his Honour makes no reference to the warning about unreliable evidence under s165. Such a warning must be taken into account before drawing the conclusion that such prejudice as may arise would be “unfair”.  
     
      
    75 His Honour gave no consideration to the directions and the warning which would prevent the evidence being misused by the jury in an unfair way. Indeed, his Honour’s general references to identification evidence were such that the application of s137 would be virtually automatic to such evidence on the basis that it is virtually presumptively “unfair” in its prejudicial effect. The provisions of the Evidence Act, which give careful attention in s115 and s116 to such evidence, reinforced by s165, would hardly be necessary. It is not the case that identification evidence must be regarded as creating an unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    76 His Honour does not identify any particular respect in which the identification evidence in the present case could be seen to be unfair. 
     
      
    77 Counsel for the Respondent submitted that in effect, albeit not in terms, his Honour should be taken to have found that the danger of unfair prejudice arose because the jury would give the identification evidence undue weight, given its limited probative value. There is no reason to suppose that that would be so in view of the warnings that would be given under s165. This would include reference to the possibility of the occurrence of a displacement effect, of the character to which his Honour made reference. 
     
      
    78 Counsel for the Respondent also suggested that there was a risk of unfair prejudice by reason of the jury speculating about the motive for Dawood retracting his identification. It was submitted that the jury would assume that he acted from fear of reprisal. That is not necessarily the case. The alternative motive to which I have referred above is the recognition by the victim, without any threats capable of constituting an admission on the part of the Respondent, of the fact that they are both members of the same small Assyrian community. Plainly, the Crown will need to convince the jury that the retraction of evidence was false. That does not necessarily point to conduct on the part of the Respondent capable of constituting an admission or otherwise constituting unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    79 For this alternative reason the appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) for an order that the first defendant, Victor Ollis, be subject to a proceeds assessment pursuant to the terms of s.27(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The function of the Court on such an application is not to assess the proceeds derived from an illegal activity, but simply to order that such a process occur.  
     
      
    2 The provisions of s.27(2) of the Criminal Assets Recover Act 1990 (the Act) make clear that the Court is required to make a Proceeds Assessment Order if certain conditions precedent are met. The terms of subsection 27(2) of the Act are: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Supreme Court must make a Proceeds Assessment Order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.” 
        
       
      
    3 Relevantly the six year period refers to any time after 19 January 2000. There are exceptions to the requirement described in the above subsection but none of them are immediately relevant. 
     
      
    4 On 19 January 2006 the Court made a restraining order under s.10 of the Act with respect to all of the interests in property of Ollis. The circumstances of the other six defendants are not caught by the provisions of subsection 27(2) of the Act, nor are they subject, at this stage, to an application either for a Proceeds Assessment Order under s.27 or for an order of forfeiture under s.22 of the Act.  
     
      
    5 The matter came before the Court on summons for summary judgment issued by the Commission on 16 March 2006 at which time Mr Dibb, of Counsel, appeared for all of the defendants. On behalf of the second to seventh defendants, Mr Dibb sought an adjournment of the application insofar as it affected the first defendant. Essentially the basis of that application was that an Assessment Order under s.27 made against the first defendant may, or will, prejudicially affect the second to seventh defendants, in circumstances where an application was before the Court of Appeal by those defendants. I rejected that application for adjournment and issued ex-tempore reasons for that rejection. In part, it was based upon the view that any application that may subsequently be made under s.22 of the Act against the second to seventh defendants would be an application, which itself could be the subject of an adjournment application and await any judgment from the Court of Appeal.  
     
      
    6 The original allegation against Mr Ollis is that on or about 16 December 2005 he committed an offence against s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 and he thus engaged in a serious crime related activity, it being an offence involving fraud which is punishable by imprisonment for five years.  
     
      
    7 The circumstances surrounding that allegation are that on 16 December last, Mr Ollis swore two affidavits, each of which was later filed in Wollongong Local Court in support of a Notice of Motion to pay a judgment debt by instalments of $1,000 per month. In so doing, it is said, he made or published, or at least concurred in the making or publishing, of a statement with intent to obtain financial benefit for himself.  
     
      
    8 Each such affidavit, the Commission submits, was a statement made with reckless disregard as to whether it was true or was false or misleading in a material particular. Affidavits were put before the Court and the evidence puts beyond doubt, although I only need to find on the balance of probabilities, that a false statement was made or published with the intent to obtain financial benefit. Mr Ollis had sworn to the fact that he could not or was not able to raise the amount in a judgment debt of some $40,000 in circumstances where he had, in the preceding month, lent $4.5 million to one person and a further $3 million to another. Over and above that amount, at the time of swearing the affidavit, he had a further $7.5 million worth of undisclosed assets.  
     
      
    9 There were further falsehoods in the affidavits. Each false statement, I find, was made by Mr Ollis with the intent to obtain financial benefit for himself. Those statements included: that he was, at the time “doing his best to pay the plaintiffs”; that he was employed by Koala Developments; the amount of the balance in one of his bank accounts; the extent of his liabilities; and the extent of his expenses. Without more, there can be little doubt that the conditions precedent for the making of a Proceeds Assessment Order have been made out by the Commission.  
     
      
    10 I have earlier mentioned that the second to seventh defendants sought an adjournment of the proceedings for summary judgment. The first defendant did not seek such an adjournment. There is no attempt to counter the evidence relating to criminal activity and the first defendant adduced no evidence relevant to that question. The response of the first defendant was to claim immunity, on the basis that the criminal activity in question was criminal activity to which Mr Ollis was liable qua his role as a witness in the proceedings to which his affidavit related.  
     
      
    11 In order to be liable under s.178BB, once the factual issues are determined, the only intent necessary in an accused person is an intent to obtain money, a valuable thing or financial advantage: Pollard v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 659. Such an offence, being a contravention of s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, is an offence involving fraud or dishonesty (Pollard, supra) and the conditions precedent to the making of the order are made out.  
     
      
    12 The immunity is argued on two bases. Firstly, it is said that the immunity extends to immunity under the Act itself. This submission is that the action under the Act is an action to which the immunity of witnesses applies and Mr Ollis has immunity from the suit now before the Court.  
     
      
    13 The other argument upon which Counsel for Mr Ollis relies is that Mr Ollis has immunity from prosecution for that which was done as a witness and that immunity includes immunity from prosecution under s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. Because of that immunity, Mr Ollis cannot be found guilty of the serious crime related activity, which underpins the criminal proceedings recovery suit under the Act.  
     
      
    14 By leave granted at the hearing on 17 March 2006 the Commission filed Supplementary Submissions dated 21 March to which the defendant responded on 29 March 2006. By the Supplementary Submissions the Commission puts, in the alternative, that the evidence before the Court makes out, on the balance of probabilities, either (or both) perverting the course of justice or an attempt so to do. Those crimes would also be within the definition of serious crime related activity for the purpose of the Act and, because they are well known exceptions to the immunity, there is, even if the immunity ran as against s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, a requirement to make the orders sought.  
     
      
    15 The submission in relation to the crime of perverting the course of justice (and I include hereafter an attempt so to do) is also relevant, it is said by the Commission, because it shows an intention in the legislature to treat the Act as another exception to the immunity otherwise available.  
     
      
    16 Further, the Commission submits that the immunity is, in any event, unavailable here. Mr Ollis is not being sued for swearing, or on the contents of, a false affidavit. The Commission’s submission is that his conduct is serious crime related activity which, coincidentally, occurred in relation to affidavits and/or evidence and therefore the immunity is, in any event, unavailable.  
     
      
       
      Witness Immunity 
       
      
    17 Fundamental to the matters raised by the first defendant, Mr Ollis, is the issue of witness immunity and it is necessary, because of the basis upon which those submissions are pressed, to expand on the principles associated with that immunity. The existence of immunity for witnesses is dependent upon common law principles, the rationale for which is, largely, the public policy associated with finality of judgments. The immunity exists for all of the actors in the litigious process: witnesses; jurors; judges; and advocates. It was expressed succinctly by Starke J in Cabassi v Vila (1940) 64 CLR 130: 
     
      
       
        
        “But it does not matter whether the action is framed as an action for defamation or as an action analogous to an action for malicious prosecution or for deceit or, as in this instance, for combining or conspiring together for the purpose of injuring another; the rule of law is that no action lies against witnesses in respect of evidence prepared, given, adduced or procured by them in the course of legal proceedings. The law protects witnesses and others, not for their benefit, but for a higher interest, namely, the advancement of public justice. The remedy against a witness who has given or procured false evidence is by means of the criminal law or by the punitive process of contempt of court.” (See  
        Cabassi 
        ,  
        supra 
        , at 141) 
        
       
      
    18 Because the rationale of witness immunity is based on the same public policy issues that effect the immunity of barristers, it is informative to examine the re-statement of those principles D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid (2005) 79 ALJR 755; [2005] HCA 12. In the joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] In  
        Giannarelli 
         Mason CJ said that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The barrister’s immunity, if it is to be sustained, must rest on considerations of public policy.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour explained that the term ‘immunity’ was used in a sense which assumed that rights and duties might otherwise exist at common law, but the immunity is sustained on considerations of public policy and ‘the injury to the public interest that will arise in the absence of immunity’. Of the various factors advanced to justify the immunity, ‘the adverse consequences for the administration of justice which would flow from the re-litigation in collateral proceedings for negligence of issues determined in the principal proceedings’ … was held to be determinative. The significance of the reference to the administration of justice is of fundamental importance to the proper understanding of the immunity and its foundation.  
        
       
       
        
        [32] … Judicial power is exercised as an element of the government of society and its aims are wider than, and more important than, the concerns of the particular parties to the controversy in question, be they private persons, corporations, polities, or the community as personified in the Crown, or represented by a Director of Public Prosecutions. No doubt the immediate parties to a controversy are very interested in the way in which it is resolved. But the community at large has a vital interest in the final quelling of that controversy. And that is why reference to the ‘judicial branch of government’ is more than a mere collocation of words designed to instil respect for the judiciary. It reflects a fundamental observation about the way in which this society is governed. …  
        
       
       
        
        [34] A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined circumstances. … 
        
       
       
        
        [35] … As was said in the joint reasons in  
        Coulton v Holcombe 
        , ‘[I]t is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial’. … 
        
       
       
        
        [37] Parties who fail in litigation, whatever its subject, may well consider the result of that litigation to be wrong, even unjust. … If that party does not succeed, an explanation for failure may be sought in what are perceived to be the failures of others – the judge, the witnesses, advocates – anyone other than the party whose case has been rejected. … 
        
       
       
        
        [39] From as early as the 16th century, a disappointed litigant could not sue those who had given evidence in the case. That is, the disappointed litigant could not seek to demonstrate that witnesses had given, or parties had suborned, perjured evidence or that witnesses or parties had conspired together to injure that litigant. … All such actions were precluded or answered by an absolute privilege. It mattered not how the action was framed and it mattered not whether the disappointed litigant alleged that the witness had acted deliberately or maliciously. No action lay, or now lies, against a witness for what is said or done in court. It does not matter whether what is done is alleged to have been done negligently or even done deliberately or maliciously with the intention that it harm the person who would complain of it. The witness is immune from suit and the immunity extends to preparatory steps. That the immunity must be pleaded as a defence makes it none the less an immunity from suit. As the whole Court said in  
        Lange v ABC 
        :  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The result [of the defence] is to confer upon defendants, who chose to plead and establish an appropriate defence, an immunity to action brought against them.’ … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [42] In  
        R v Skinner 
        , Lord Mansfield said that ‘neither party, witness, counsel, jury or judge can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office’. Of that immunity it has been said in  
        Mann v O’Neill 
        , that it responds to two related considerations ‘to assist full and free access to independent courts for the impartial quelling of controversies, without fear of the consequences’ and ‘the avoidance of the re-agitation by discontented parties of decided cases after the entry of final judgment’ other than by appellate process. That view of the matter reflects the consideration that what is at stake is the public interest in ‘the effective performance’ of its function by the judicial branch of government.” 
        
       
      
    19 Applying those principles to the situation of Mr Ollis, the first defendant, it is clear that Mr Ollis has an immunity for all that was done as a witness and the preparatory steps thereto. The remaining questions relate to whether that immunity exempts Mr Ollis from orders under the Act either indirectly because of the immunity to charge under s.178BB of the Act, or directly because the immunity protects the first defendant from any cause of action arising under that Act. I will return to these questions after dealing with the alternative argument that, even if there is an immunity under s.178BB of the Act, the evidence before this Court is sufficient to show conduct which perverted the course of justice or attempt to do so.  
     
      
       
      Perverting the Course of Justice or Attempt  
       
      
    20 As I understand the argument of the Commission, by swearing the affidavits, Mr Ollis made false statements and in so doing intended (and had a tendency) to pervert the course of justice by obstructing the capacity of the Local Court to dispense justice, so as to obtain financial benefit for Mr Ollis. The financial benefit sought to be obtained was the making of an order by the court which was otherwise than in accordance with the justice of the case.  
     
      
    21 As I understand the submission of the Commission, it is that the acts done by Mr Ollis contravene Part 7 of the Crimes Act, either in the general provisions of s.319 or otherwise.  
     
      
    22 The Crimes Act 1900 defines “pervert the course of justice” as a reference “to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law”: s.312. Perverting the course of justice is not confined to criminal proceedings. Within the terms of Part 7 of the Crimes Act it is an offence for a person “with intent to mislead any judicial tribunal in any judicial proceedings … [to fabricate] false evidence (other than by purgery or suborning purgery), or knowingly make use of fabricated false evidence: s.317: for which contravention a person is liable to imprisonment for ten years.  
     
      
    23 The general offence, a contravention of s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900, is for any person who “does any act, or makes any omission intending in any way to pervert the course of justice” for which such person is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. A contravention of either section would meet the definition of serious crime related activity within the meaning of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. Certainly, a contravention of s.317 of the Crimes Act which involved fraud would meet the aforesaid definition. I make that comment lest it be thought that the specific provision in s.317 of the Crimes Act does not come within the generic term perverting the course of justice as stated in the Act. 
     
      
    24 The evidence before me includes the affidavit of Jonathon Lee Sparke, an officer of the Commission, which, apart from setting out formal documentation including the order under s.10 and the application for the order under s.27, exhibits documents which were marked exhibit A and exhibit B, respectively being a copy of the Wollongong Local Court file and transcript of portions of the audio recording of the examination of Mr Ollis on 9 February before Deputy Registrar Green.  
     
      
    25 The defendant adduces no evidence independently of the affidavit and exhibits mentioned above. The defendant submits that the offence of perverting the course of justice is not available on the facts before the Court because it does not establish that Mr Ollis had an intention to pervert the course of justice and there is no evidence before the Court from which such an intention could be gleaned. This submission founds itself on the transcript adduced by the Commission, in which, in examination and cross-examination, Mr Ollis explains how it was that the false documents were compiled and filed.  
     
      
    26 The explanation is to the effect that the document, which is admittedly false, was signed without being read in the presence of Mr Ollis’ solicitor who had compiled the document without instructions and without the provision of any information by Mr Ollis, who was handed the documentation by his solicitor through the window of his car. There can be no doubt that Mr Ollis was aware that the documentation was to be used in the proceedings in the manner in which it was used. The Court does not accept the evidence that the documentation was not read and/or that the contents of it were unknown and were not based on information provided by Mr Ollis. Further, calling of the solicitor in question to testify to each of those matters could easily have corroborated the evidence in question. He was not called. The necessary inference is that the evidence of the solicitor would not have assisted the case of Mr Ollis. The explanation given by Mr Ollis is, independently, fanciful. It would require the court to accept that the solicitor, not Mr Ollis, perverted the course of justice. The court is not prepared to draw that inference on the basis of the evidence presented. 27 The non-acceptance of the evidence of Mr Ollis does not mean that there is evidence of intention. Intention is an element of a contravention of s.319 of the Crimes Act. Section 319 of the Crimes Act is in different terms to the common law of perverting the course of justice but it is informative to repeat that which was said by the High Court in R v Rogerson (1992) 174 CLR 268:  
     
      
       
        
        “Attempting to pervert the course of justice, like perverting the course of justice, is a substantive offence … It consists of the doing of an act which has a tendency to pervert the course of justice with an intent to pervert the course of justice” (citations omitted) (per Brennan and Toohey JJ at [2]) 
        
       
      
    28 Section 319 does not seem to require that the act done with the intent to pervert the course of justice must itself have a tendency itself to pervert the course of justice, but in these proceedings nothing turns on whether or not that is the case.  
     
      
    29 On the basis of the material before the Court that is accepted, namely the documents which show an obvious inconsistency and the admissions that they are false, an inference is available that the documents, signed by Mr Ollis, to be used in the course of proceedings, were intended to effect the natural consequences of their compilation and use. That inference is more readily drawn because of the failure to call the solicitor, the one independent person capable of giving evidence of substantiating what would otherwise be seen as a somewhat fanciful proposition.  
     
      
    30 In those circumstances, the Court finds it more probable than not that Mr Ollis engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more, it being an offence that occurred not more than six years before the making of the application for the order under s.27, the offence being a contravention of s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of s.27 of the Act, the Court is required to make a Proceeds Assessment Order and will do so. Lest my analysis of that which is required under s.319 (even on the balance of probabilities) is wrong, I proceed to deal with the proper construction and interpretation of the Act. I do so, also, because it is necessary to deal with the primary argument: that the immunity applies in such a way as to provide a defence to any civil action under the Act.  
     
      
    31 Another answer to the submission by the Commission that the defendant, in any event, has engaged in serious crime related activity because of the operation of s.319 of the Crimes Act (or more generally, Part 7), is a construction of the Crimes Act which contrasts s.319 with s.389 and s.339. The defendant submits that because perjury and false swearing are the subject of separate contraventions with significant restrictions on the persons who may prosecute, it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to include an act which may amount to perjury as an act which perverts the course of justice. This submission, although not expressed in this way, is to the effect that s.327 (with the restrictions imposed by s.338 and s.339) is intended to deal exclusively with conduct which comes within its reach. In so doing, so the argument goes, the legislature must have intended that perjury was outside the reach of the provisions of s.319 and other like provisions: see by analogy Anthony Hordern & Sons v Amalgamated Clothing & Allied Trades Union of Australia (1932) 47 CLR 1; R v Wallis (1949) 78 CLR 529. The proposed approach to construction of the statute must be applied with great care; it is “a valuable servant, but a dangerous master” (Colquhoun v Brooks (1888) 21 QBD 52 at 65), “and applies only when the intention it expresses is discoverable upon the face of the instrument”: see Houssein v Department of Industrial Relations and Technology (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94. 
     
      
    32 To construe the Crimes Act as requiring each crime to be mutually exclusive would be an unusual construction. Most criminal activity will contravene more than one legislative prohibition. While there may be double jeopardy issues associated with being charged with more than one offence, that is not a reason to assume that because criminal conduct is contravention of one section, it is not, also, a contravention of another. But the more direct answer to the argument is found in the terms of s.317 of the Crimes Act, which is part of the offences dealing with perverting the course of justice. Paragraph (b) expressly exempts perjury or suborning perjury from its reach. Such an express exemption would be otiose if s.327 was intended exclusively to deal with perjury and all of Division 2 of Part 7 was required to be construed in such a way as to exclude its application to perjury. This express exemption stands in stark contrast to the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (c) of s.317 itself. The normal principles of construction would require paragraphs 317(a) and (c) to be construed so that their reach included perjury or suborning perjury. There is no reason to construe s.319 more narrowly. 33 That is not to say that all perjury will amount to perverting the course of justice. The inclusion of some perjury within the reach of s.319 does not render s.327 of the Crime Act otiose. On a purposive approach to the provisions, the restrictions on prosecution for perjury apply only to perjury and, where conduct that amounts to perjury is also an offence of another kind, those restrictions do not support a construction of the Crimes Act to exclude such conduct from the reach of every other section. 
     
      
       
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act and Immunity thereto 
       
      
    34 The Act defines, in s.6, a serious crime related activity. As earlier summarised, it relevantly includes an offence which is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more and involves theft, fraud, obtaining financial benefit, perverting the course of justice and other offences. Subsection 6(1) of the Act expressly provides that conduct is a serious crime related activity, whether or not the relevant person has been charged with the offence or, if charged, has been acquitted, or has been convicted and the conviction quashed or set aside.  
     
      
    35 The primary argument as to immunity, and the argument based upon the immunity of s.178BB of the Crimes Act, depends upon a construction of the Act and an understanding of the application of the witness immunity. I have set out, at more length than is usual, the policy basis for witness immunity. The witness immunity arises under the common law. The legislature is capable, at any time, of displacing that immunity. Whether the immunity applies to the Act is a question of the construction of the Act and its relationship with the immunity.  
     
      
    36 Two further answers are sought to be put by the defendant to orders under s.27 of the Act. They are that the Act does not expressly override the common law immunity for witnesses and should therefore be construed in such a way as not to impact upon it. The principles to be adopted in relation to the construction of a legislative enactment and its relationship with the common law was most succinctly summarised by Gleeson CJ in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union (2004) 78 ALJR 1231; [2004] HCA 40, in which the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[19] Reliance was placed in argument upon what was said to be a general principle of construction that, where a statute takes away or interferes with common law rights, then it should be given, if possible, a narrow interpretation. The generality of that assertion of principle requires some qualification. It is true that courts do not impute to the legislature an intention to abrogate or curtail fundamental rights or freedoms unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. It is also true that there is a presumption, relevant for example to the construction of privative clauses, that the legislature does not intend to deprive the citizen of access to the courts, other than to the extent expressly stated or necessarily to be implied. However, as McHugh J pointed out in  
        Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd 
         modern legislatures regularly enact laws that take away or modify common law rights. The assistance to be gained from a presumption will vary with the context in which it is applied. For example, in  
        George Wimpey & Co Ltd v British Overseas Airways Corporation 
        , Lord Reid said that in a case where the language of a statute is capable of applying to a situation that was unforeseen, and the arguments are fairly evenly balanced, ""it is ... right to hold that ... that interpretation should be chosen which involves the least alteration of the existing law"". That was a highly qualified statement and, if it reflects a presumption, then the presumption is weak and operates only in limited circumstances.  
        
       
       
        
        [20] In  
        Coco v R 
        , Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:  
         
          
          ‘The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights.’ (footnote omitted)  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [21] The joint judgment in  
        Coco 
         went on to identify as the rationale for the presumption against modification or abrogation of fundamental rights an assumption that it is highly improbable that Parliament would ""overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law"" without expressing its intention with ""irresistible clearness"". In  
        R v of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Pierson 
        , Lord Steyn described the presumption as an aspect of the principle of legality which governs the relations between Parliament, the executive and the courts. The presumption is not merely a common sense guide to what a Parliament in a liberal democracy is likely to have intended; it is a working hypothesis, the existence of which is known both to Parliament and the courts, upon which statutory language will be interpreted. The hypothesis is an aspect of the rule of law.” 
         
        
       
      
    37 Fundamentally the “presumption” is a matter of statutory construction which is borne in mind in determining the proper operation of any enactment. 
     
      
    38 As made clear in the passage cited from D’Orta-Ekenaike (see [39] of the High Court judgment, infra) the immunity of a witness must be pleaded. Such an immunity may be waived.  
     
      
    39 Prior to the pleading of the immunity, the conduct giving rise to the criminal offence (or civil liability) still fits the description which would render the defendant liable. It is only if and when the immunity is pleaded to the charge (in the case of a criminal offence) that the defence arises and, assuming it is established, it thereafter is an immunity from suit. It does not alter the nature of the conduct of the defendant, it only exempts the defendant from liability in circumstances where the defendant chooses to rely on it.  
     
      
    40 I return then to the definition of serious crime related activity in s.6. It matters not, for the purposes of the Act whether a charge has been laid, whether there has been a trial, whether there has been an acquittal or whether there has been an acquittal on the basis of an immunity pleaded by the defendant; the operative force of the Act depends upon the nature of the conduct, not the success of any suit or prosecution in relation to the conduct.  
     
      
    41 Further, the inclusion in subsection 6(2)(d) of the Act of the offence of “perverting the course of justice” shows a clear legislative intention that the Act will not be subject, in and of itself, to the immunity of witnesses or parties to proceedings. Indeed, a judge who in the course of fulfilling his/her duties was guilty of perverting the course of justice would likewise be amenable to the provisions of the Act.  
     
      
    42 Perverting the course of justice is a known exception to the immunity of witnesses (and other persons) involved in the litigation process.  
     
      
    43 To that analysis must be added the terms of s.27 of the Act. Once the Court finds the preconditions satisfied (i.e. that it is more probable than not that the person engaged in a serious crime related activity of the relevant kind) the Act requires the Supreme Court to make a Proceeds Assessment Order. The Court is, once satisfied of the pre-conditions, not possessed of a residual discretion to refuse to make an Assessment Order.  
     
      
    44 A combination of these factors leads me to conclude that the witness immunity that would otherwise be applicable does not apply directly to the Act. Further, it leads me to the view that, notwithstanding that Mr Ollis may have a good defence to a charge under s.178BB of the Crimes Act based on witness immunity, the Act still requires the making of an order under s.27 of the Act in circumstances where the conduct of Mr Ollis amounts to conduct which shows that he, more probably than not, engaged in a serious crime related activity of the requisite kind.  
     
      
    45 Furthermore, if one were to examine this construction in the light of the public policy, one would come to the view that the construction was appropriate: firstly, the Act requires suit not by the party to the original litigation but by the State; secondly, the suit is, itself, in aid of the administration of justice; thirdly, it is in the nature of perjury and perversion of the course of justice, albeit civil in that it is a suit directed at the activity itself, not at an indirect consequence thereof, for example, damage to an injured party. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    46 I find that, even though Mr Ollis probably has an immunity on the basis of his status as a witness to a charge under s.178BB of the Crimes Act, that immunity arises only if and when Mr Ollis is charged and pleads the defence of the immunity. Prior to that point (and even after it) the criminal conduct in question still meets the definition of serious crime related activity under the Act and the immunity does not exempt Mr Ollis from the application of that Act to his assets.  
     
      
    47 Further, on the evidence before the Court, I find that it is more probable than not that Mr Ollis was, at a time not more than six years before the making of the application for an order under s.27 of the Act, engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more, namely, conduct which would amount to a contravention of s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    48 In those circumstances, the preconditions for the making of orders under s.27 have been made out and I propose to make appropriate orders. I will hear the parties on the form of any such orders.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jason Wayne Nicholas pleaded guilty earlier to an indictment containing three counts. One was an aggravated break, enter and steal, one was an offence of break, enter and steal, and a third was another offence of break, enter and steal. The circumstances of aggravation in the first case was that Mr Nicholas was in company. I note from the statement of facts that he was also in company in relation to the second matter but, as the Crown has very properly pointed out, I should ignore that fact because to do otherwise would be to breach the rule in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.2 In view of the course that I intend taking, I will not set out the facts which led to those offences being committed. They were obviously serious offences, aggravated by the circumstance that in each case Mr Nicholas was on conditional liberty. 3 There are also form 1 matters attached to the second and third counts.4 At the outset of the proceedings today Mr Wilson, who appears for Mr Nicholas, indicated that it was to be his application that I should deal with the matter by way of s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown, in its written submissions, initially opposed that order but, having heard the evidence, particularly the evidence from Mr Nicholas himself, the Crown, quite fairly and properly, conceded that he no longer opposed the making of the order. 5 The reasons that the Crown has changed his mind and the reasons that I will grant the application made by Mr Wilson are that these offences were committed at a time when Mr Nicholas was suffering a significant mental illness. He suffers from schizophrenia but, as is relatively common, initially denied to himself that he had that mental illness and was thus unreliable in taking the medication that had been prescribed for him. Indeed, such was the state of Mr Nicholas’ mental illness that he had earlier been found unfit to be tried for some of the offences to which he has now pleaded guilty. That situation has now resolved itself and he was found fit to be tried earlier, after which he entered those pleas of guilty I have spoken about.6 Dr Neilssen, who saw Mr Nicholas on two occasions, was able to compare how he first appeared to how he appeared when he last saw him on 25 October last year. It is clear that there has been a significant change. Dr Neilssen reports that when the offender was committing the current offences his abnormal mental state arising from exacerbations of mental illness was likely to have resulted in a significant impairment in his perception of events, his capacity to judge right from wrong, and his ability to control his actions. 7 This is a case where there is more than just potential for Mr Nicholas’ rehabilitation. There is solid evidence to suggest the likelihood that Mr Nicholas will be able to overcome his drug addiction and will continue taking the medication prescribed to him for his schizophrenia. Much has already been done by Mr Nicholas, with the help of others. He has given up both Methadone and cigarettes for just a couple of days short of a year. He, as I have mentioned a couple of times, is now compliant with his medication. He understands that he suffers from schizophrenia. He recognises the need for him to participate in further rehabilitation in order to build upon what has already been achieved. 8 One of the reasons that s 11 remands are granted is so that an offender’s prospects for rehabilitation can be better assessed. This is one such case. Ultimately the purpose of the criminal law is to protect society and, more importantly, the members of society from harm. Often the criminal law achieves that purpose by imposing deterrent sentences on the basis that others who may be tempted to commit criminal offences will see that, if they do so, they will be significantly punished. However, the criminal law also recognise other ways in which society and its members can be avoided; in particular, through the rehabilitation of offenders. 9 For that reason, as the Court of Criminal Appeal has recognised on many occasions, to say that the criminal law exists to protect society is not to say that deterrent sentences must always be imposed. If the criminal law is able to respond in a way which promotes an offender’s rehabilitation and which achieves that, such that he or she no longer commits offences, then the protection of society is enhanced in that way. For those reasons, it is important that where rehabilitation can be achieved and where there are good prospects of rehabilitation, the criminal law should not respond to the commission of criminal offences by automatically imposing a harsh punishment.10 The offender has been assessed as being suitable to enter the assessment phase of the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre programme. Should he be accepted into that programme, he will undergo a ten month fulltime residential rehabilitation programme. 11 I propose to remand Mr Nicholas under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the event that he is found to be an appropriate person to enter the fulltime rehabilitation programme. 12 For the purposes of assessing Mr Nicholas’ capacity and prospects for rehabilitation, I adjourn this matter to 23 February 2007. 13 I grant bail to Mr Nicholas in the meantime pursuant to these conditions. He is not to be released from custody until written confirmation of the availability of a bed in the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre programme is faxed or otherwise provided to the correctional centre from which Mr Nicholas is to be released, and a copy of that document is faxed or otherwise provided to the solicitor in charge of this matter at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 14 Secondly, he is not to be released from custody except into the custody of his uncle Ian Nicholas, with whom he is to travel directly to the Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre. 15 Thirdly, he is to remain at, live at and participate in the programme at the Centre until completion of the rehabilitation programme. 16 Fourthly, he is to obey all reasonable directions of staff at the Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre. 17 Failure to attend or remain at the centre or participate in the programmes will be regarded as a breach of this bail, upon which bail is immediately revoked and Mr Nicholas is to be arrested. 18 It is a further condition of bail that should Mr Nicholas be discharged from the programme for any reason whatsoever, bail is immediately revoked and he is to be arrested.19 The matter is also to be listed before me on 19 May at 2pm in order to confirm that Mr Nicholas has been accepted into the treatment phase of the programme. In the event that Mr Nicholas is assessed as being suitable to enter the treatment phase, his attendance on 19 May is excused. In the event that he is determined to be suitable, I will merely note that fact on 19 May and will make no other order.

     JUDGMENT 
    1  HODGSON JA: I agree with what is proposed by Justice James, and subject to what I say below, with his reasons.2 There is some force in the submission for the Crown that the sentencing judge must have been aware of the option of suspending the sentences and must have rejected that option, and that it was not an error that he did not specifically undertake the three-stage process referred to in Douar v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 455.3 However, even if that submission were accepted, in my opinion the reasons given on sentence do disclose error in that, on that interpretation of the reasons, they indicate that the option of suspending the sentence was rejected wholly on the basis of general considerations, without weighing in the balance powerful considerations particular to these cases. 4 Most importantly, the circumstance that the applicants had undertaken and, over a period of fourteen months, complied with a MERIT program and had successfully completed that program, was a powerful consideration in their favour. I think there is public interest in having successful completion of such a program explicitly adverted to as a factor favourable to a defendant in the sentencing process, in order to encourage others to successfully complete such programs.5 In my opinion, this consideration is not entirely subsumed in the prospects of rehabilitation of an offender. There is some force in the Crown’s submission that the level of the sentences shows that the sentencing judge did have regard to this factor. But this does not overcome his reference to generalities as excluding anything but full time custodial sentences.6 In my opinion, this is an error which makes it appropriate for this Court to consider what sentence should be imposed. The particular circumstances of this case, including the circumstance of these applicants having undergone five months in custody, make it appropriate for this Court to suspend the sentences.7 JAMES J: These applications by Joanne Maree Brown and Hadley James Reid for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on them in the District Court on 17 November 2005 by his Honour Judge Maguire were heard together in this Court. Before they went to prison, the two applicants were in a de facto relationship with each other and, although they were not actually co-offenders in the offences for which they were sentenced, the offences for which each was sentenced were similar to the offences for which the other was sentenced. Each applicant had pleaded guilty to all of the offences for which he or she was sentenced. For the sake of convenience, I will refer to the applicants simply by their surnames.8 The sentences imposed on the applicant Brown were:- For an offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, a non-parole period of 12 months, with a balance of the term of imprisonment of 12 months. For an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, a non-parole period of 6 months, with a balance of the term of 6 months. For each of two offences of goods in custody, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months. 9 The sentencing judge made all the sentences imposed on Brown commence from 15 November 2005, so as to allow for a short discrete period of pre-sentence custody. 10 The sentences imposed on the applicant Reid were:-For an offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, a non-parole period of 12 months, with a balance of the term of imprisonment of 12 months. For each of three offences of suppling a prohibited drug, a non-parole period of 6 months, with a balance of the term of 6 months. 11 The sentencing judge made all of the sentences imposed on Reid commence from 14 November 2005, so as to allow for a short discrete period of pre-sentence custody. 12 Supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis is an offence under 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. Supplying a prohibited drug is an offence under section 25 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years.13 The facts of the offences committed by the applicants can be briefly stated as follows:14 Brown: As to the first charge of ongoing supply, on each of 25 August 2004, 30 August 2004 and 3 September 2004 Brown supplied a small quantity of heroin ranging from .14 of a gram to .18 of a gram for a price of $100. As to the second charge of supplying a prohibited drug, on 23 August 2004 Reid supplied .07 of a gram of heroin for a price of $50. Brown was present at the time the heroin was supplied and was criminally complicit in the supply. 15 Reid: As to the first charge of ongoing supply, on each of 23 August 2004, 24 August 2004 and 31 August 2004 Reid supplied a small quantity of heroin of about .15 of a gram for a price of $100. As to the three charges of supplying a prohibited drug, on each of 30 August 2004, 3 September 2004, and 8 September 2004, Brown supplied small quantities of heroin (.18 of a gram on the first occasion and .14 of a gram on the second occasion) for a price of $100 or $200. Reid was present at the time the heroin was supplied and was criminally complicit in the supply. 16 All of the supplies by both applicants were made in the course of an authorised controlled operation by police, of which the applicants were, of course, unaware.17 A somewhat curious feature of the charges is that neither applicant was charged for supplies made by that applicant in which the other applicant was complicit and for which the other applicant was charged. 18 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing Brown Judge Maguire quoted or summarised parts of a presentence report dated 18 July 2005 prepared by a probation and parole officer, in which some of the subjective circumstances of Brown were set out. His Honour also made other findings about the subjective circumstances of Brown.19 Brown was born on 20 July 1975, and was accordingly 30 years old at the time she was sentenced. She had some criminal history which his Honour in his remarks on sentence described as minor. The parts of his Honour's remarks on sentence in which his Honour quoted or summarised parts of the pre-sentence report were as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Brown was born in Yass and is the eldest of four children. She reported that when she was seven years old her mother left the family home and that she and her sister were reared by her father and her paternal grandmother. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown’s mother remarried and this union produced two children. Ms Brown reported that her half brother died when he was fifteen years old as a result of a heroin overdose. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown reported that she has a close relationship with both her father and mother. According to Ms Brown, her father was an honest man and she stated that she was raised with strict moral and ethical values. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        However, she stated that she has not told her father of her current offences as she was ashamed and did not want to disappoint him. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Contact with Ms Brown’s mother revealed that she had known that her daughter had been using drugs for years but that she was surprised that she was dealing drugs. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown has two children from a previous relationship aged thirteen and ten respectively. She has been in a relationship with her current partner [co-offender] for the past three years. There are no children from this liaison. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown completed Year 10 and commenced a Certificate Of Business Administration. However, she was unable to complete this traineeship due to having a baby. Ms Brown stated that she has not been employed since 1992. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        At interview, Ms Brown presented as genuinely distressed in relation to the possibility of a period of incarceration and how this will affect her children. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She admitted to having a heroin addiction and that she was dealing drugs to supplement her own drug use. Ms Brown reported that she would buy a deal and then take out some for herself and then resell it so she could buy more heroin. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown reported that her partner [co-offender] had not used drugs until he met her. She expressed regret that he became a drug addict due to her negative influence on him. However, it was pointed out to Ms Brown that her partner was an active participant in the using and selling of the heroin. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown stated that she last used heroin in January 2005 and that she used at least 3 times after her arrest in September 2004. At interview, Ms Brown was adamant that she had not used in the past 6 months. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        However, Ms Brown failed to acknowledge that had her drug dealing not been intercepted by police she would have more than likely still be using and dealing. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        As to the charges of Goods In/On Premises, Ms Brown admitted that she knew the boys clothing was stolen goods and that she bought them from her sister. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        As to the charge of the Proof of Age card, Ms Brown stated that she found the card in the street and had intended to take it to the shop where she had found the card outside on the pavement. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown reported that she commenced using cannabis at the age of nineteen and progressed to using amphetamines and then heroin. Ms Brown stated that she used to use heroin three times a day. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She noted that she ceased using heroin when the relationship with her defacto terminated in 2001. She stated that she was ‘clean’ for 2 years and relapsed back to her heroin use when she was offered a ‘free shot’ from her then girlfriend. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown reported that she immediately reverted to her significant heroin addiction and began dealing to supplement her income to enable her to purchase more heroin for her own use. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She is currently on the Methadone Program of 60 mls a day and is intending to decrease this prescribed dosage to enable her to commence on the Buprenorphine Program. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Contact with the Merit Program confirmed that Ms Brown had attended their program and completed a Relapse Prevention Program. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Contact with the Killard Centre confirmed that Ms Brown attends the Methadone Clinic every day and that out of seven urine tests only one returned a positive for heroin on 08/01/2005. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown intends to decrease her Methadone dose to enable her to commence the Buprenorphine Program in the near future. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It was reported that Ms Brown has, since her first appointment on 17/11/2004, presented as less angry and with improved communication skills. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Ms Brown reported that she had been dealing heroin to support her own heroin addiction. She stated that she was using heroin up to three times a day”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    20 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing Reid, Judge Maguire quoted, or summarised parts of a pre-sentence report dated 18 July 2005, prepared by a probation and parole officer Ms Skinner, in which some of the subjective circumstances of Reid were set out. His Honour also made other findings in his remarks on sentence about the subjective circumstances of Reid. 21 Reid was born on 29 May 1978 and was accordingly 27 years old at the time he was sentenced. The parts of his Honour's remarks on sentence in which his Honour quoted or summarised parts of the pre-sentence report were as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Reid first came into contact with this Service in October 1996 when he received a supervised good behaviour bond from Queanbeyan Children’s Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Mr Reid was supervised throughout those 12 months and reportedly responded in a satisfactory manner. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He next came into contact during the preparation of a pre-sentence report in August 2000 for assault police, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an unrelated shoplifting. He was apparently extremely intoxicated with liquor at the time. He received three concurrent 18 month custodial sentences with six months non-parole in October 2000 for these offences. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On his release in April 2001 his case management focused on his alcohol intake and cannabis use with some purported success. His main goal was to obtain work and in early 2002 he began employment as a trainee at a New South Wales Government Department in Queanbeyan. At the time of the end of his supervision it was noted that he did very well. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        During the preparation of this report Mr Reid has been involved with the Merit Team, Alcohol and Drug Services, Methadone Program and this Services’ Aboriginal Client Service Officer. He has reported satisfactorily although not always as scheduled. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Identifying as Aboriginal Mr Reid is the eldest of two boys to his mother. He first remembered meeting his father at about the age of five, however, he claimed that at that time his father sexually molested him. His mother remarked at the time her son stated he never wanted to go back to his father but apparently she did not know of the molestation allegation. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Reid stated that he next met his father at the age of 16 when his father came back into his life ostensibly to help his son get back on track after he’d got into some trouble as a juvenile. This arrangement apparently did not work. Mr Reid describing his father as a stranger who he never connected to and within 12 months his father is reported to have disappeared from his life. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Reid described his relationship with his mother as difficult stating that when he was growing up she used to beat him sometimes with an electric cord to the point of bleeding. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        His relationship with his brother appears to also have been violent with some incidents of violence that involved the police. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The mother stated that she was disappointed and angry at her son’s offending behaviour and that she had not brought Hadley up to do things like that. She said he had no male role models throughout his childhood. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He is in a four year relationship with the co-offender. He has no children of his own, however his partner has two children who live with them. He finished Year 11 at High School in 1995. He had a fairly good work record prior to his illicit drug use”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He presented as a young man with a history of some drug and alcohol abuse. He has taken steps to address that use and seems motivated to gain work and skills that are employable. His relationship with the co-offender continues and that appears to be a support to remain free of future drug use and offending behaviour”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    22 In this judgment reference has already been made to some of the subjective circumstances of each of the applicants. However, only passing reference has been made to the subjective matters which were the focus of most of the argument on the two applications. 23 The two applicants were arrested on or about 8 September 2004. On 9 September 2004 both applicants were assessed as suitable to enter a MERIT programme. MERIT is an acronym for Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment.24 On 9 September 2004 each applicant was granted bail on conditions which included the following conditions:  
     
      
       
        
        “1. Report daily between 8 am and 8 pm to the Officer in Charge at the Queanbeyan Police Station; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. Report to the MERIT team upon release and obey all reasonable directions of members of the MERIT team; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. Reside at 4 Young Street, Queanbeyan or as directed by the MERIT team.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    25 Each applicant was released on bail and remained at liberty on bail until sentenced by his Honour. Each applicant entered into a MERIT programme. A MERIT programme was described in general terms by Ms Skinner in one of her reports as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “To remain on Methadone and increase dose (daily attendance required) 
         
        Review stability regularly with prescribing doctor and caseworker 
         
        Random urinalysis 
         
        Relapse management 
         
        Explore education and training options 
         
        Weekly case management and supervision at MERIT Office” 
        
       
      
    26 In a report of 27 July 2005 Ms Skinner, as a MERIT caseworker, described the response of Brown to the treatment plan as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “It would be unrealistic to say that Ms Brown’s response to the treatment plan has been 100% successful, however all things considered her progress has been remarkable and I believe she has reached a stage in her rehabilitation from where she can only progress, she has: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Remained on the Methadone Program 
           
          Attended all appointments with her prescribing doctor and Methadone case manager 
           
          Provided random urine samples as requested 
           
          Completed and actively participated in a four weeks Relapse Management course 
           
          Attempted a TAFE business course/explored tertiary study options 
           
          Attended all appointments at MERIT 
           
          Maintained stability for her children 
           
          Made arrangements to repay her outstanding debts”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 In a report of 26 July 2005, Ms Skinner described the response of Reid to the treatment plan as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Reid has responded remarkably well to the treatment plan and has complied willingly with all direction from this worker. Mr Reid has been proactive with his treatment options, with the result that he has gained a great deal of insight into his addiction, as evidenced by the number of random urines which have revealed no illicit drug use”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    28 On 27 July 2005 both applicants came before Judge Maguire. There were admitted into evidence pre-sentence reports for both applicants; the further reports on both applicants by Ms Skinner; and drug and alcohol reports by Ms Maloney, a member of the Regional Drug and Alcohol Treatment Team attached to the Greater Southern Area Health Service. All of these reports were highly favourable to the applicants, indicating that they had abstained from using drugs, that they had participated fully in the MERIT programme, and that they had achieved a high degree of rehabilitation. 29 On 27 July 2005 each of the applicants gave oral evidence before his Honour.30 On 27 July 2005 the legal representatives of each of the applicants submitted that Judge Maguire should make an order under section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, adjourning the proceedings on sentence for the purpose of furthering the applicant's rehabilitation. These applications were opposed by the Crown, on the grounds that, if an offender has been convicted of trafficking in a prohibited drug to any substantial degree, then, save in exceptional circumstances, a custodial sentence should be imposed. 31 Judge Maguire refused the applications for orders under section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. His Honour said that he would not pass sentence ""in the short-term"", wishing to have a transcript of the proceedings on 27 July 2005 and the opportunity of giving the matters further consideration. His Honour observed that it was inevitable that a full time custodial sentence would be passed on each applicant. However, his Honour continued each applicant’s bail.32 Both applicants came before Judge Maguire on 17 November 2005. In addition to the reports which had been admitted into evidence on 27 July 2005, further reports were admitted into evidence, being, in the case of each applicant, a further report from Ms Skinner and a further report from the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Team. All these further reports were highly favourable to the applicants. 33 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing Brown Judge Maguire accepted that she had sold heroin, only in order to support her own drug habit; that she had a history of heart trouble; that she had had a disadvantaged childhood; that she was concerned for her own children; that she was contrite; that she was continuing to abstain from using drugs; that her prospects of rehabilitation were good; that she was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for her pleas of guilty; and that there were special circumstances within section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 34 However, his Honour proceeded to say:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Offences of this nature are taken very seriously by the community which expects the Court to visit them with sentences of imprisonment. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        General deterrence is an important factor in the sentencing process in such cases. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The statistics provided by the Judicial Commission demonstrate that any sentence less than full-time custody is rare indeed”. 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour refused a further application which had been made for an order under section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and his Honour proceeded to impose the sentences of imprisonment stated earlier in this judgment.36 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing Reid, his Honour referred to some of the favourable reports about Reid. His Honour found that Reid was contrite and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and that there were special circumstances within section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, his Honour made the same remarks as he made in sentencing Brown about community expectations, the need for general deterrence and the statistics provided by the Judicial Commission.37 His Honour refused a further application for an order under section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and proceeded to impose the sentences of imprisonment stated earlier in this judgment.38 A number of grounds of appeal were raised by the applicants but, in my opinion, it is unnecessary to refer to all of them. It is convenient to proceed to consider the common ground of appeal that his Honour erred in not giving consideration to whether the execution of any sentences of imprisonment should be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.39 In Zamagias v R [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed, set out the steps which should be taken by a judge in imposing a sentence of imprisonment under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. See especially at paragraphs 22 to 32 of Howie J’s judgment.40 A sentencing judge should first determine, pursuant to section 5 of the Act, whether he or she is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.41 If a judge decides that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, the judge must then decide what the term of the sentence of imprisonment should be. In deciding what the term of a sentence of imprisonment should be, a judge is not to have regard to how the sentence might be served, including whether the execution of the sentence might be suspended.42 Having decided what the term of a sentence of imprisonment should be, a judge must then decide how the sentence should be served, for example, whether it should be served by way of periodic detention or by way of a home detention order or whether the execution of the sentence should be suspended.43 Howie J was careful to state at paragraph 30 of his judgment that it is unnecessary for a sentencing judge expressly to state that he or she has taken all of these steps. In many cases there will be no live issue that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate or that the sentence of imprisonment set should be served by way of immediate full time imprisonment.44 In the case of the present applicants, although the sentencing judge did not expressly refer to section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I consider that it is clear from the comments made by his Honour on 27 July 2005 and from the remarks on sentence delivered by his Honour on 17 November 2005, that his Honour did give consideration to whether a penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate and concluded that no penalty other than imprisonment would be appropriate. Such a conclusion was clearly open to his Honour and did not involve any error.45 As regards the second step, the terms of the sentences set by his Honour were, in my opinion, lenient, and clearly within a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion.46 However, the question arises whether the sentencing judge did give consideration to the final step to be taken by a sentencing judge, that is, of determining how the sentences of imprisonment should be served and, in particular, whether the execution of the sentences of imprisonment should be suspended under section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.47 Section 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order:  
         
          
          (a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
           
          (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence”. 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    48 Section 12 of the Act was capable of being applicable because none of the sentences imposed by his Honour were for terms of more than two years.49 I have noted earlier in this judgment that the way in which a sentence of imprisonment should be served will often not be a live issue and there is no general requirement that a sentencing judge should expressly state that he has given consideration to how a sentence of imprisonment he is about to impose should be served. Furthermore, in the present case no application had been made by the legal representative of either applicant in the proceedings on sentence that execution of any prison sentence should be suspended.50 However, in the case of each of these applicants, the applicant had been assessed as suitable for a MERIT program. Each applicant had been released on conditional bail, including conditions that the applicant enter into a MERIT program. Each applicant had entered into a MERIT program and had participated in that program for more than a year and reports from the case workers and health professionals showed that each applicant had participated fully in the program and had achieved a high degree of rehabilitation. There was also evidence that each applicant had obtained employment.51 In these circumstances, I consider that the sentencing judge was required to give consideration to whether he should suspend the execution of the sentences of imprisonment he was about to impose, even though no such submission had been made on behalf of either applicant in the proceedings on sentence.52 Before this Court, it was submitted by counsel for the Crown that it could be inferred from the remarks made by his Honour about community expectations, the need for general deterrence in sentencing for offences of these kinds and the statistics provided by the Judicial Commission and from a remark made by his Honour that he could not let the applicants go home, that his Honour had given consideration to whether he should exercise the discretion under section 12 of the Act to suspend the execution of the sentences of imprisonment.53 I am not persuaded that his Honour did give consideration to whether he should exercise the discretion to suspend the execution of the sentences. 54 The remarks made by his Honour on which the Crown relied were made, in each set of remarks on sentence, in the context of his Honour considering and refusing an application for a “Griffiths remand”, that is an application for an order, not under s 12, but under s 11 of the Act.55 I consider that, in not giving consideration to whether the execution of the sentences should be suspended, the exercise by his Honour of his sentencing discretion miscarried. In fairness to his Honour, I repeat that no submission had been made to his Honour in the proceedings on sentence that he should make orders under section 12 of the Act.56 The judge at first instance not having exercised the discretion conferred by section 12 of the Act, this Court should itself exercise the discretion. In exercising its discretion the Court of Criminal Appeal can take into account matters occurring since the original sentencing of the applicants. Such matters include that the applicants have now spent over five months in prison. Such matters also include, in the case of the applicant Brown, further medical evidence about her heart condition and about her having been pregnant at the time of the sentencing, and having subsequently, on medical advice, had a termination of the pregnancy.57 In my opinion, this Court should make orders suspending the execution of the sentences imposed on the applicants. The offences which the applicants committed are offences of a kind which are properly regarded as objectively serious. However, the particular offences committed by these applicants were at, or close to, the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for such offences. The offences of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug involved the supply of very small quantities of drugs by persons who were themselves addicted to drugs and who were dealing in drugs, only in order to support their own drug habits.58 Even apart from rehabilitation, each of the applicants had some subjective features meriting some leniency in sentencing. As regards rehabilitation, each of the applicants had demonstrated over a lengthy period a capacity for rehabilitation and had already achieved a high degree of rehabilitation. As I have already remarked, each of the applicants has now served more than five months in prison.59 It was submitted on behalf of both applicants that some allowance should have been made, and should be made, for what was submitted to be a kind of quasi-custody to which the applicants had been subjected under the bail conditions and the MERIT program. The restrictions principally relied on by counsel for the applicants were that the conditions of bail involved daily reporting to police and the conditions of the MERIT program involved daily attendances, for example at a centre to obtain methadone. However, a MERIT program falls far short of being a full time residential program in a drug rehabilitation centre. If any allowance was to be made for this factor, it would, in my opinion, only be a very small allowance. 60 Having regard to my conclusion on the common ground of appeal I have been considering, it is unnecessary to consider in detail the other grounds of appeal. I would reject grounds of appeal that his Honour did not take into account a period of quasi-custody, that his Honour erred in deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate or that the terms of the sentences set by his Honour were manifestly excessive.61 I consider that in the case of each applicant the Court should make an order under section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act suspending the whole of each sentence for the entire term of the sentence.62 The practical effect of such orders would be that the applicants would be entitled to be released.63 HOEBEN J: What troubles me about his Honour’s remarks on sentence is that he appears to have rejected out of hand any consideration of a suspended sentence. This was in the context of a strong subjective case to the effect that both applicants had successfully completed fourteen months of a strict drug rehabilitation program.64 Against that background, it seems to me that his Honour should have provided some reasoning for why a sentence of fulltime was inevitable. It follows that I agree with Justices Hodgson and James and the orders proposed by them.65 HODGSON JA: I will deal first with the case of Brown, and the orders I propose are: (1) Leave to appeal granted. (2) Appeal allowed. (3) Sentences below quashed. (4) On the first count, applicant sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and balance of term of one year, to commence on 15 November 2005, so that the term of the sentence expires on 14 November 2007 and the non-parole period expires on 14 November 2006. (5) On the second count, applicant sentenced to a non-parole period of six months and balance of term of six months, to commence on 15 November 2005, so that the term of the sentence expires on 14 November 2006, and the non-parole period expires on 15 May 2006. (6) In respect of each of two charges of goods in custody, applicant sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months to date from 15 November 2005. (7) Execution of all those sentences is suspended, in each case for the term of the sentence. (8) Applicant to be released from custody on condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence on the first count.66 Turning to Reid: (1) Leave to appeal granted. (2) Appeal allowed. (3) Sentence below quashed. (4) On the first count, applicant sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and balance of term of one year, to commence on 14 November 2005, so that the term of the sentence expires on 13 November 2007 and the non-parole period expires on 13 November 2006. (5) On each of the second, third and fourth counts, applicant sentenced to a non-parole period of six months, and balance of term of six months, to commence on 14 November 2005, so that the term of the sentence expires on 13 November 2006 and the non-parole period expires on 13 May 2006. (6) Execution of all these sentences is suspended, in each case for the term of the sentence. (7) Direct that the applicant be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence on the first count.67 Those are the orders of the Court.68 I return the exhibits.

       10118/2004 
        
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Film Financial Consultants Limited (“Film Financial”) claims declarations, damages, including exemplary damages, and an injunction based upon an alleged unlawful interference with contract, interference with economic interests, and unconscionability in contravention of s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act.  
     
      
    2 The plaintiff alleges that in early February 2002 the National Film Trustee Company (“NFTC”) appointed Film Financial to audit the sub-distribution of the motion picture Waking Ned Devine by Dendy Films in Australia. Dendy Films is owned by the first defendant, Becker Group Limited (“Becker Group”). Other primary distributors licensed Becker Group to distribute motion pictures in Australia and, it is alleged, appointed Film Financial to audit that distribution. A dispute arose between Becker Group and Film Financial relating to a comment made by Film Financial about Becker Group and Becker Group and its MD Mr Becker (the second defendant) refused to allow Film Financial to enter their premises. Film Financial alleges that this conduct was unlawful, that it caused damage and that it caused a breach of the auditing contract between the principal distributors and Film Financial.  
     
      
    3 It is necessary to deal in more detail with the facts, including the terms of the relevant contracts, the principles of law applicable to those facts under each of the causes of action set out above. The film Waking Ned Devine is referred to in various contracts and documents by that name or by the name Waking Ned. In this judgment, the longer title will consistently be used. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 Film Financial conducts business as an independent film distribution auditor and has performed work for major and independent motion picture production companies and movie distributors in studios throughout the world since approximately February 1988. Film Financial was founded by its current principal, John Mr Sapsford, resident of London, a chartered accountant registered with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.  
     
      
    5 Standard practice for the distribution of motion pictures is for there to be a Head Distribution Licence entered into between the producers of the particular motion picture and a worldwide distributor. Consequently the worldwide distributor enters into a number of sub-distribution agreements for a particular country or particular countries. Becker Group is a sub-distributor in Australia under such arrangements and distributes films to cinemas and video/DVD outlets for reward.  
     
      
    6 Because fees are generally paid by reference to the incidence of distribution (as variously defined) it is usual for the producer (in the case of a Head Distribution Licence) and the worldwide distributor (in the case of sub-distribution agreements) to reserve the right to have the figures produced, which form the basis of the calculation of any fees, audited. I will deal with the particulars of the various contracts shortly.  
     
      
    7 There is a trade association for the film and television industries which provides collection, advocacy and arbitration services to member organisations throughout the world. That association is called the American Film Marketers Association (“AFMA”), which also supplies some recommended or standard terms to be incorporated in distribution agreements. Not unexpectedly, a number of the distribution agreements to which I will later refer incorporate the AFMA standard terms and conditions and in so doing specify the AFMA as an arbitrator and the law of one or more particular states in the United States of America as the governing law.  
     
      
    8 On 20 September 1996 Pandora Cinema SA, of France (a licensor) entered into a sub-distribution licence agreement with Dendy Films Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Becker Group, for the film Kolya. Because there are claims under the Trade Practices Act, I should recite that the plaintiff is incorporated in the United Kingdom with its registered office in London, the principal business activities of which are described as business and management, consultancy, accounting, auditing and tax consulting. Its sole director is Mr Sapsford.  
     
      
    9 Becker Group is a publicly listed company on the Sydney Stock Exchange. Its interests now extend into theatrical film distribution and Becker Group is a significant distributor of films across Australia and New Zealand. It owns the Dendy chain of art-house cinemas and through another of its subsidiaries, the Globe Group Pty Ltd, distributes Australian films. Film distribution revenue for the Becker Group represents approximately 25-30 percent of its total turnover.  
     
      
    10 The sub-distribution licence for the movie Kolya of 20 September 1996, referred to in the preceding paragraph, contained a clause under the heading “Accountings” in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “e.  
        Audit Rights 
        : Continuing until three (3) years after the Term, Licensor may examine and copy on its own or through its auditors Distributor’s financial records regarding the Picture on ten (10) days’ notice. The examination will be at Licensor’s expense unless an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) is uncovered, in which case the Distributor will pay the costs of the examination on demand.”  
        
       
      
    This will be referred to as the “standard audit clause”. 
     
      
    11 I should make clear that payments made by the Distributor to the Licensor were calculated under the above contract on a basis which differentiated between various kinds of income and costs. In the sub-licence agreement of 20 September 1996 the disposition of gross receipts, was in relation to theatrical and non-theatrical: the recoupment of one hundred percent of the first gross receipts attributable to distribution costs. Thereafter, fifty percent of the gross receipts would go to each of the Licensor and the Distributor. Further, in relation to home or commercial video, seventy percent of the net revenue would go to the Licensor and thirty percent to the Distributor. In relation to Free TV or Pay TV, sixty percent would go to the Licensor and forty percent to the Distributor. There were other distributions, means for providing for any shortfall and other ancillary matters.  
     
      
    12 Ultimately any further details of the financial distribution between the parties to the contract are irrelevant. It is necessary, however, to recite that payments to the Licensor by the Distributor depended upon the costs of distribution, the amount of the income and the source of that income.  
     
      
    13 On 14 May 1997, Overseas Film Group Inc (“OFG”) entered into a Licence agreement with Estoaat BV in relation to the movie Waking Ned Devine. That Licence agreement was for a period of 12 years commencing on 7 August 1998 and included Australia and New Zealand. It contained a clause, which I will hereafter refer to as the “standard AFMA clause”, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The AFMA Standard Terms and Conditions and Schedule of Definitions as amended, in writing, by the parties negotiating in good faith, are incorporated herein by this reference and by signature below Distributor acknowledges that they have been read and agrees to be bound by them. If any provisions of the standard Terms and Conditions and Schedule of Definitions conflict with any provisions of the Licence Agreement, the latter shall prevail.” 
        
       
      
    14 The AFMA International Standard Terms covered exclusivity limitations, territories and the agreement terms, they defined gross receipts, recoupable distribution costs, they provided for payment requirements and provided for an audit clause in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “10.6  
        Audit Rights 
        : Until three (3) years after the Agreement Term, Licensor may on fifteen (15) days’ prior Notice examine and copy, on its own or through its auditors, Distributor’s financial records regarding the Picture. The examination will be at Licensor’s expense unless it uncovers an underpayment, uncontested or later determined due, of more than ten percent (10 percent) of the amount shown due Licensor on the statements audited, in which case Distributor will pay the costs of the examination on demand.”  
        
       
      
    This clause will be referred to as “the AFMA audit clause”. 
     
      
    15 The distributor in the agreement of 14 May 1997, Estoaat BV sold its distribution interests to Atrium Films International (Australia) Pty Ltd by an acquisition agreement dated the same date. That acquisition agreement contained the same AFMA standard clause which imported the AFMA audit clause.  
     
      
    16 Also on 14 May 1997, Atrium entered into a licence agreement (the Waking Ned Devine sub-licence) with Becker Group under which Becker Group distributed Waking Ned Devine in territories including Australia and New Zealand in relation to certain rights being cinematic rights (theatrical and non-theatrical), hotel, video rights, demand view, pay-per-view and free television (with some exceptions). Payments under that licence agreement were a guaranteed minimum of an amount which is irrelevant for all purposes, and percentage payments of receipts from distribution, including the distribution pursuant to the video rights and theatrical and non-theatrical (except in the case of theatrical and non-theatrical the sum was less distribution expenses). In the case of video rights, Becker Group was required to enter into a sub-distribution deal with PolyGram Pty Ltd. The Atrium/Becker Group agreement annexed to it the AFMA standard terms and conditions which included the requirement on Becker Group to maintain complete and accurate records of the financial transactions relevant to the calculation of payments to Atrium and the standard audit clause.  
     
      
    17 On 27 June 1997 OFG entered into a distribution agreement with the producer of the film Waking Ned Devine.  
     
      
    18 Other films were being distributed and were subject to audit. During September and October 2000, Mr Sapsford, on behalf of Film Financial, undertook for Summit Entertainment an audit of the Becker Group records in relation to the movies The Blair Witch Project and Curse of the Blair Witch - Mockumentary. During the course of the conduct of that audit, Mr Sapsford sent an email to Tim Keen of Becker Group with a copy to Brad Kembel of Summit Entertainment, the effective licensor to Becker Group. It was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subject: Video/Outstanding Issues 
         
         
        I did glance at the two statements Paul provided and noted the twenty percent distribution fee and some manufacturing costs which were under $4 per unit.  
        However, I don’t know the deal with PolyGram and again it could be that the issue of tape and duplication cost is fudged because of the distribution fee as it is with Magna. 
          
        I could get duplication for free with the right distribution fee in place! 
          
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Best Regards John” (emphasis has been added) 
        
       
       
      The reference to Leon is a reference to Magna, elsewhere referred to in the email. Magna is alleged to be a related company to Becker Group; it undertakes the copying of films and other tasks which are charged to and paid by Becker Group, which charges reduce the amount upon which the royalty/profit on distribution is calculated. 
       
      
    19 This email was drawn to the attention of Mr Becker shortly after the Becker Group had received it and Mr Becker gave evidence to the effect that he was particularly concerned about the use of the word “fudged”.  
     
      
    20 On 30 October 2006 a letter, on the letterhead of Becker Entertainment entitled “Legal and Business Affairs Memorandum”, was sent from Robert Reeve of Becker Group to John Mr Sapsford. That letter said in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 1. The suggestion in your email that Becker Group Limited (“Becker”) has in some way either alone or as part of a conspiracy with our video sub-distributors “fudged” tape and duplication costs is not only unprofessional and without any substance in fact, but clearly defamatory of Becker. Accordingly, Becker reserves it’s rights against you concerning that statement and the implication that Becker has acted dishonestly and with an intention to defraud in its dealings with Summit. … 
        
       
       
        
        2. … We are advised by Leon … of Magna … that the issue of video duplication costs was not raised by you in your initial discussions with him (notwithstanding that you had raised the matter with us before that time), and it is apparent that your failure to avail yourself of this right under the contract in a timely manner is the principal reason for your current intransigence concerning those costs. Having said this, we note that information has been supplied to you by [Leon] on this issue and we wish to make it very clear to you and to Summit that we are totally satisfied that our video sub-distributors have fully and honestly accounted to us for their exploitation of the Film.  
        
       
       
        
        3. Becker has not only complied in all respects with its contractual obligation to provide full and free access to its Financial Records, including all records held by it in connection to the video sub-distribution of the Film, but has gone the ‘extra mile’ on numerous occasions in supplying requested information, explanations and facilities. 
        
       
       
        
        4. We note that you have attended our premises, at considerable inconvenience to us, over the period 3-16 October 2000, although you have not been in attendance on each business day during that period and for many, if not most, of those days, your attendance was for relatively short periods (four hours or less). In our view, based on numerous audits undertaken in respect of Films distributed by Becker, this is more than sufficient time to have completed your audit and any further time would constitute unwarranted and unnecessary expense.  
        
       
       
        
        5. In view of the above matters, we must now advise that, as far as Becker is concerned, the audit is at an end and no further access to our premises or records will be permitted.” 
        
       
      
    21 On the same date Mr Sapsford, by email, responded to the letter set out above. He expressed surprise as to its terms, and denied any implication by the use of the term “fudged” that Becker Group has acted dishonestly in any way whatsoever. Mr Sapsford asserted that his intention was certainly not to impute dishonesty and it was understood by Summit in the way he, Mr Sapsford, had intended. Mr Sapsford apologised if he had caused offence.  
     
      
    22 Further distribution agreements were made between Atrium and Becker Group and between other distributors and Becker Group for sub-distribution within Australia and New Zealand. Some of the films covered by those agreements were The Body and D’Artagnan.  
     
      
    23 On 15 March 2001 Film Financial report on the audit in relation to The Blair Witch Project and Curse of the Blair Witch – Mockumentary was delivered to Summit. That audit report makes a number of assertions. It asserts that Film Financial requested access to Magna’s records in order to perform their standard audit checks but that Becker Group did not provide them with access to the Magna records and they were, therefore, unable to perform the tests they considered necessary. There are further assertions, the details of which are unnecessary to repeat, relating to the level of payments between Becker Group and Magna based upon what were perceived to be the appropriate costs and other items for which Becker Group calculated that Summit were owed an amount of money and that there were a number of items for which information was requested but that information was not provided.  
     
      
    24 By letter dated 5 April 2001 Summit writes claiming US$138,319 being amounts owing to Summit on the basis of the audit conducted by Film Financial and which, according to that audit, should have been paid to Summit yet were not.  
     
      
    25 As earlier stated, Film Financial had, at various times, provided estimates for the cost of auditing a number of movies which were being distributed by Becker Group. Those movies included Kolya, D’Artagnan and Waking Ned Devine. Those audit estimates were for a number of producers and/or head distributors.  
     
      
    26 On 16 January 2002, Becker Group responded to the letter from Summit in relation to The Blair Witch Project and the audit reports related thereto.  
     
      
    27 The response followed some correspondence between Summit and Becker Group relating to the payment of the overages and the view of Becker Group that there were significant concerns with the audit report and the inferences made in that report. The audit report consisted of 10 pages plus annexures. The response consisted of 10 pages plus annexures. It is a detailed response. The details, like the details in the audit report, are relevant to the issues before the Court only in a peripheral sense. It is sufficient for the purposes of this judgment to recite that issue was taken with amounts that were entitled to be deducted, estimates that were made without substantiating evidence, the deductibility or non-deductibility of certain items from the amounts which would be subject to calculation for the purposes of the payment of royalties, the categorisation of certain expenses and whether amounts ought to have been included in one period’s records or another. One of the more significant items related to an allegation of overcharging in relation to sub-distribution fees described in the audit report as action points 11 and 12 and similarly described in the response. Essentially the issue between the parties was the amount charged (and perhaps its reasonableness) by Magna to Becker Group in relation to the costs associated with video revenue and video rental revenue. The amounts in question involved an under-reporting of income or an over-reporting of costs of US$151,337 resulting in an alleged underpayment of US$45,401. Film Financial performed the estimates of these figures on the basis of disallowing all costs or estimating and extrapolating from some minor information. The reason for the estimation and extrapolation, and the reason for disallowance of all costs in relation to one item, was the allegation that Becker Group did not provide Film Financial with access to the documentation necessary to audit the amounts.  
     
      
    28 In an email exchange on 13 and 15 October 2000 it was made clear that Becker Group had arranged with Magna to provide all of the information necessary to Mr Sapsford. The problem was that Magna could provide the information in source documentation only and was in “boxes full of invoices for each month”. It was suggested that such an examination would take at least four days and, after consultation with Summit, Mr Sapsford maintained that either Becker Group or Magna should undertake that examination and provide a list from the invoices provided.  
     
      
    29 Mr Sapsford was cross-examined in relation to these matters and the exchange was as follows (at page 21, line 25 et seq): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Magna offered to provide you with boxes full of the invoices for each month, didn’t they? 
        
       
       
        
        A: That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: They offered an opportunity of reviewing each invoice and credit note? 
        
       
       
        
        A: They offered me an opportunity of going through them and performing that task, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And noting those invoices which related to  
        The Blair Witch Project 
         to compare the figures reported? 
        
       
       
        
        A: They offered that opportunity. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: They were offering you access to their records in order for you to satisfy your enquiries, weren’t they? 
        
       
       
        
        A: No. The access I was requesting by my standard information request was a listing of invoice per invoice which would total the amount that Magna were reporting to Becker; they had no such list.  
        
       
       
        
        Q: You wanted them to do the hard yards for you.  
        
       
       
        
        A: I wanted them to provide information in a normal auditable form. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But they didn’t have a list? 
        
       
       
        
        A: That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But what they offered to provide you with were the physical invoices? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: From which a list could be compiled. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Correct.” 
        
       
      
    30 The sub-distribution agreements for The Blair Witch Project were not in evidence. It is therefore impossible for the Court to determine in what form it was necessary to provide the accounting information required. If one were to conjecture on the basis of those contracts that are before the Court, there are a number of aspects which are significant. There is a requirement in some of the agreements (see the sub-licence between Atrium and Becker Group for Waking Ned Devine) for accountings which require the distributor (in this instance Becker Group) to “maintain complete and accurate records in the currency of the Territory of all financial transactions regarding the picture in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the entertainment distribution business on a consistent, uniform and non-discriminatory basis throughout the agreement term… . The records will include all gross receipts derived, all recoupable distribution costs paid ”. The audit rights have already been set out. Those terms are substantially identical to the standard AFMA terms for accounting records.  
     
      
    31 In the dispute between Becker Group and Film Financial relating to these issues, if the terms were the same or substantially the same as the terms in other such contracts, the obligation on the Becker Group would have been to maintain their own records in an “auditable form” and to provide access to an auditor properly appointed to examine and copy the distributor’s financial records.  
     
      
    32 In this instance, an issue has been raised by the auditor, not about the records of Becker Group, but seeking to go behind the costs incurred by Becker Group, being payments to a sub-contractor for the provision of goods and/or services because, on the perception of the auditor, the relationship between Becker Group and its sub-contractor was not arm’s length. On the basis of those contracts that are before the Court, there was no requirement on Becker Group to provide the list of invoices at Magna and Magna was not bound by any of the contracts.  
     
      
    33 Of course, as earlier stated, the Court is incapable of making definitive findings in relation to the contractual relationship between Becker Group and Magna or between Becker Group and Summit because those contracts are not before the Court. The reason for the above analysis is that the dispute between Becker Group and Mr Becker, on the one hand, and Film Financial and Mr Sapsford, on the other hand, has its genesis in the suspicion of Mr Sapsford concerning the legitimacy of the costs deducted for The Blair Witch Project which suspicion was based on a certain perception of the relationship between Becker Group and Magna. It is that suspicion which gave rise to the allegation concerning “fudging” and the comments in the audit report. However, the comments in the audit report, to the effect that access to the information was not provided, are false.  
     
      
    34 Access to the information and source documents was provided, but the invitation declined. That which was not provided was a summary document for the purpose of Mr Sapsford and/or Film Financial auditing Magna, not Becker Group. I do not here suggest that an audit or investigation of the legitimacy of the payments between the Becker Group and Magna was not an appropriate function in an audit of the Becker Group. I do suggest that, on the basis of the material before the Court, or even on the basis of some conjecture based upon other material before the Court, there was no contractual obligation on Becker Group to provide in auditable form the financial records of Magna. Further, the audit report of 15 March 2001 in relation to The Blair Witch Project was, to the extent that it stated that “Becker did not provide us with access to the Magna records”, false and knowingly so.  
     
      
    35 The suspicion expressed by Mr Sapsford that “the issue of tape and duplication cost is fudged” is one to which Mr Becker took great exception. Mr Sapsford’s explanation that no implication of dishonesty arises and that the meaning ascribed to the term by Becker Group was not open to them cannot be sustained. Dictionary definitions were provided to the Court of the use of the term “fudged”. The Macquarie Dictionary defines fudge (when used as a verb) in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “To put together in a makeshift, clumsy or dishonest way; fake … –  
        verb 
         (intransitive) … (in games and contests) to gain advantage improperly”. 
        
       
      
    36 In the context of the email of 24 October 2000, especially the reference to the capacity to obtain duplication for free in certain circumstances, the word is being used to mean “to gain advantage improperly”. Even if the word were confined to honest behaviour, it seems to necessarily imply a failure to follow the normal rules and to blur the proper distinctions.  
     
      
    37 As already stated Mr Becker and Becker Group took umbrage at the comments. Thereafter Becker Group refused to allow Mr Sapsford onto the company’s premises or access to its books for any purpose.  
     
      
    38 The evidence of Mr Sapsford, given both in affidavit form and orally, is disingenuous in its explanation of the allegation that he was denied access to the records of Magna and his use of the word “fudged”. In circumstances where it is accepted that the list which summarised the relevant invoices did not exist in the Magna records, it cannot be said, on any understanding of ordinary language, that he was “denied access” to such a list. Moreover, his explanation of the use of the word “fudged” is not accepted. The evidence, including the manner in which it was given and the demeanour of Mr Sapsford, inevitably leads to the rejection of that evidence. Moreover, the statement in the audit report confirms, albeit indirectly, the opinion that Mr Sapsford then had.  
     
      
    39 Further, the written apology, disavowing any allegation of dishonesty, was not sent to the person in Summit to whom the initial email was sent.  
     
      
    40 Following the correspondence and audit report relating to “The Blair Witch Project”, Becker Group continued to prohibit Mr Sapsford from entering its premises or gaining access to its records generally and in particular in relation to the audit of two further films, Waking Ned Devine and Kolya. 
     
      
    41 This prohibition is evidenced in a number of ways and admitted by the defendants. By letter dated 8 February 2002, OFG informed Becker Group that Film Financial had been engaged to perform the audit for Waking Ned Devine and that consultants from that firm would contact them shortly. On 22 February 2002, Pandora informed “Dendy/Becker Films” that Film Financial would be performing an audit for the film Kolya. 42 By email dated 27 February 2002, Becker Group informed OFG, through one of its agents, that Becker Group had “no objection to Overseas Film Group carrying out an audit of this film, however you will have to select another auditor due to issues which remain unresolved with John Mr Sapsford (Film Financial Consultants) relating to an audit carried out by him on another Becker/Dendy film.”  
     
      
    43 By email dated 1 March 2002 OFG informed Becker Group that it was “insisting that we use Film Financial Consultants to perform this audit”. By further email dated 1 March 2002 Becker Group once more insisted upon the proposition that they would not “allow John Mr Sapsford onto [their] premises”. The reason for the refusal to allow John Mr Sapsford’s access to the premises and records was succinctly contained in an internal email within the Becker Group from Richard Becker to David Horton in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dave 
        
       
       
        
        It’s got nothing to do with outstanding issues with Summit. He accused us of conspiring with the video distributor. The clear implication was fraud and he is lucky we didn’t pursue our rights (if any). I don’t want to meet or speak with him. He is unprofessional, his conduct disqualifies him from conducting any further audits with this company.” 
        
       
      
    44 By letter dated 11 March 2002 OFG insisted upon John Mr Sapsford conducting the audit and informed Becker Group that the failure to allow access by John Mr Sapsford was a clear breach of the agreement. On 13 May 2002 OFG referred the dispute between it and Becker Group to arbitration with the AFMA. That arbitration concluded with an award on 2 October 2002 which award made clear that OFG, under the agreements, was “entitled to designate John Mr Sapsford or other auditors of its choice to conduct an audit of Becker Group Limited pursuant to the terms of the Licence Agreement … with respect to the motion picture entitled Waking Ned Devine” and awarded costs of $200 for filing fee against Becker Group and otherwise required each party to pay half of the fees of the Arbitrator.  
     
      
    45 Following the Arbitrator’s award, OFG did not further insist upon the conduct of an audit. John Mr Sapsford sought to conduct the audit but Becker Group continued to deny him access. Further the Becker Group informed others who sought to utilise Mr Sapsford or Film Financial that Becker Group were not prepared to agree to Mr Sapsford auditing their accounts. As a consequence of that attitude, Film Financial were not engaged for at least one audit and probably others.  
     
      
    46 At one stage it was thought to be suggested, during the course of cross-examination of the second defendant, that the issues associated with the allegations by Film Financial of “fudging” were not of particular importance to either Mr Becker or Becker Group. Part of that cross-examination concerned a meeting between Mr Becker and representatives of Summit. It was put (transcript page 78) that if there had been a genuine concern which had prevented work being obtained from Summit, that would have been raised specifically. The explanation given by Mr Becker of the meeting (see in particular transcript page 73 and following) and the approach of Becker Group to the representatives of Summit at that meeting is accepted. Moreover the evidence of Mr Becker was such that I accept his evidence and, to the extent that there are inconsistencies between the evidence of Mr Becker and Mr Sapsford, I accept the evidence of Mr Becker.  
     
      
    47 From the foregoing, it is clear that the licensors, or head distributors, were entitled under the contracts with Becker Group to appoint auditors and, from time to time they did. In a number of instances the auditor appointed, or suggested for appointment, was Film Financial. Unfortunately, there are no executed contracts before the Court between any of the head distributors and/or licensors and Film Financial.  
     
      
    48 In that regard, Mr Sapsford was the subject of cross-examination as to the nature of any contracts that existed. The evidence of Mr Sapsford was to the effect that it was normal practice to have a written agreement, that there would always be “an estimate in writing” and there would always be a written confirmation of the acceptance of the estimate “before any work was accepted”. However, no such document is produced in these proceedings. Mr Sapsford’s evidence is that they “may be on the computer”, being a reference to his laptop. The documents were never produced. It was conceded, in evidence, that the documents had not been lost.  
     
      
    49 There are a number of other matters with which it is necessary to deal. The first of them is that Mr Sapsford, in cross-examination, conceded, and it seems to be the case, that any arrangement between licensors and Film Financial to carry out an audit was subject to significant change almost at the whim of the Licensor. Whether a licensor decided to conduct an audit at all is a matter entirely for the licensor. The contractual provision granted a right to conduct an audit, not a requirement to conduct an audit. Further, even when a licensor has indicated to Film Financial that the licensor would like Film Financial to undertake a particular audit, the licensor was able to change its mind at any stage up to the conduct of the audit. That is similarly the situation in relation to the identity of the auditor chosen by the licensor. (See transcript page 26) 
     
      
    50 The second matter which warrants comment, in relation to the evidence before the Court, is the question of whether or not Film Financial were paid auditing fees for the audit of Waking Ned Devine. Fundamentally, liability in tort arises from the occasioning of damage. I will deal with this later in the judgment. However, in relation to the auditing of Waking Ned Devine, it is impossible for the Court to determine that Film Financial was not paid its full entitlement.  
     
      
    51 I have already referred to the email chains being correspondence between Becker Group and Mr Sapsford relating to Becker Group’s refusal to allow Mr Sapsford access to documents. In an email of 6 March 2002, Mr Sapsford claims that “the producer has already paid … the fee for the job so now expects to receive some service!” The plaintiff’s case was, by leave, re-opened and Mr Sapsford gave sworn evidence that the above statement was incorrect and that he received no money whatsoever for a fee from the audit of Waking Ned Devine. The cross-examination of Mr Sapsford on this point was telling. Mr Sapsford agrees that the statement in his email to Mr Becker was false and a lie. During the course of the cross-examination he seeks to lay the blame for its inclusion in his affidavit at the feet of his solicitors. The changing nature of the evidence given by Mr Sapsford on this question confirms my impression in relation to his evidence generally. By and large he avoided a number of questions, often deliberately answered a different question to the one asked, deliberately sought to volunteer material about other people’s views and justifications and was unable to provide detail in areas where one would expect detail to be forthcoming.  
     
      
    52 The impression of Mr Sapsford was that his answers were given on a basis which he perceived would best suit his case at the time. The issue of the payment for the auditing work in Waking Ned Devine is but a prime example of that attitude. One of the difficulties associated with this area of controversy is that the contract between Film Financial and the licensor is not before the Court. Even if the Court were prepared to conjecture as to the terms of the contract, the only basis upon which that could be done is a quotation or estimate, which is described as an agreement, dated 31 January 2002, and which is unexecuted. Its terms require an initial payment prior to the commencement of each audit based upon the estimated hours and a later reconciliation. On one view, at least, the initial payment would be evidence of the finalisation of the agreement to audit. If there were no payment, on that view, that would be evidence that no final agreement to audit had been made or, at least, that the audit was not in a position to commence, regardless of the level of access.  
     
      
    53 The difficulty that faces the Court is that the evidence of Mr Sapsford that he was not paid is not accepted. However, the evidence that he was paid is also not accepted. The Court is unable to find, even on the balance of probability, either fact, although, as a matter of logic, one of them must be the case. Given the nature of the evidence, each of the possibilities is equally available and I cannot find, on the balance of probabilities, that any one of them has been proven. If I were forced to choose between the two equally available possibilities, I would hold that payment was made. That ‘preference’ arises from the contemporaneity of the note to that effect and the interest in proving the contrary in these proceedings. 
     
      
    54 On the basis of the material before the Court, there was in existence a contract for Film Financial to audit Becker Group in relation to Waking Ned Devine. That contract was to conduct an audit within the confines of the right to audit specified under the contract between Becker Group and the head distributor and allowed for the examination and copying of documents, already in existence, in the possession of Becker Group relating to the particular film.  
     
      
    55 While I accept that there were loose arrangements for Film Financial to be able to conduct audits in relation to the films Kolya, The Body and D’Artagnan, on the evidence before the Court, it is not possible to conclude that there were contracts between Film Financial and the licensors. The material suggests that the arrangements were tentative and subject to the constraints that the licensors could at any time have decided not to audit or to audit using different personnel. The evidence shows that Mr Sapsford accepted that proposition and that his affidavit refers to the proposition that he “was to be appointed auditor of those films.” 
     
      
    56 One further factual matter should be addressed. The parties to some significant degree blurred the distinction between different entities and between the principals and their corporations. This is partly because of the manner in which the distribution agreements are intertwined and the mutual appointment of attorneys that occur, it seems on the evidence, between each different subsidiary of the one parent and between the parent and each subsidiary. Nevertheless, the parties here treated action by Mr Becker as the same as action by Becker Group (generally a fair inference) and action by Dendy as action by Becker Group and so on.  
     
      
    57 Further, the express prohibition on Mr Sapsford entering Becker Group’s premises and gaining access to accounts has been assumed to be a ban on Film Financial in its entirety. The email exchange between Becker Group and OFG of 26 February and 1 March 2002 is typical. Becker Group writes to inform OFG that they, Becker Group, have no objection to an audit of the film, but require the selection of another auditor because of “issues which remain unresolved with John Mr Sapsford (Film Financial Consultants) relating to an [earlier] audit”. The response from OFG is that “the producer is insisting that we use Film Financial …”, after which OFG are informed by Becker Group that their Managing Director “has clearly advised that we will not allow John Mr Sapsford onto our premises.” There has been no attempt to show that Film Financial could not have conducted the audit using other personnel. John Mr Sapsford is not a plaintiff. However, the parties have assumed throughout that the prohibition on John Mr Sapsford is a prohibition which applies generally to Film Financial and I will determine the matter in accordance with that assumption.  
     
      
       
      The Plaintiff’s Claims 
       
      
    58 The plaintiff claims damages and injunctions under three causes of action.: unlawful interference with contractual rights; interference with economic interests; and s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act. The plaintiff claims under no other cause of action in common law, nor does it claim under any other provision of the Trade Practices Act or any other statute. I confine myself, as I must, to that which is claimed. It should be pointed out that the claim against the second defendant, Mr Becker, is pursuant to the terms of s.75B of the Trade Practices Act on the basis of his accessorial involvement. If the claim under s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act were successful, it would necessarily follow that Mr Becker would be personally liable under s.75B of the Act.  
     
      
    59 Before dealing with each of the causes of action, it is necessary to re-state that central to the principles associated with liability in tort for actions such as interference with contractual relations is the concept of damage. If action is taken, which comprises all of the elements of a tort, but there is no resulting damage, there can be no liability. That is not only the question of the measure of damage, and the absence of a liability for damage, but a fundamental element of the tort itself.  
     
      
      Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations 
       
      
    60 The plaintiff puts its case on the basis that it is entitled to damages against each of Becker Group and Mr Becker in relation to their “unlawful interference with its contracts with the producer/licensors of Waking Ned Devine and Kolya to audit the first defendant’s records of the distribution of those films.”  
     
      
    61 The plaintiff alleges that entitlement to compensation for that tort arises because the defendant knowingly and intentionally procured a breach of the contract between Film Financial and the licensor. The plaintiff alleges that there are three elements of the tort: 
     
      
    a A breach of contract;b Brought about by an act of the defendant;c Which act is unlawful e.g. which is a direct procurement of the breach with knowledge and intention of bringing about the breach.  
     
      
    62 Notwithstanding the description of the cause of action by the plaintiff the elements of the cause of action do not require an independently unlawful act. The tort derives from the judgment in Lumley v Gye (1853) 118 ER 749. The early cases, expanded by Lumley v Gye, were largely concerned with the tortfeasor inducing a servant to breach the contract with their master for the purpose of being employed by the tortfeasor. It was not an element of that tort that the offer of employment by the tortfeasor was itself an unlawful act. To the extent that the cases suggest the necessity for an unlawful act, they, somewhat circularly, also seem to suggest that the unlawful act can be the act of inducing or interfering with the contractual relations.  
     
      
    63 The other element of historical development of these industrial or economic torts that requires preliminary comment is that there is a necessity for there to be a breach of the contract. Thus, it is not an actionable tort for a person to induce an employee of another to terminate lawfully their contract of employment, for the purpose of obtaining employment elsewhere. Were it otherwise, much of the employment practices of every modern democracy would be actionable. (See Independent Oil Industries v Shell Co of Australia Limited (1937) 37 SR (NSW) 394) 
     
      
    64 The elements of the tort were summarised by Isaacs J in Short v City Bank of Sydney (1912) 15 CLR 148. At page 160 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But to constitute that cause of action, the defendant must have induced or procured the doing of what he knew would be a breach of contract. A  
        bona fide 
         belief reasonably entertained that it was not a breach of contract would be fatal to the claim. If the defendant did not know of the existence of the contract, he could not induce its breach; if he reasonably believed it did not require a certain act to be performed, he is inducing a party to the contract to do something inconsistent with it could not be regarded as an inducement or procurement knowingly to break the contract; if he believed on reasonable grounds that the contract had been rescinded, or performance waived, when in fact it had not, he could not be said to knowingly procure its breach. If this were not so, no man would be safe in the ordinary transactions of life, because he might find contrary to his knowledge or belief an expectation that some contract or enterprise he entered into were inconsistent with the contractual or other obligation of the party with whom he was agreeing or dealing. No doubt every man must be understood to intend the natural consequences of his acts; but that means having regard to the circumstances with which he is, or is assumed to be, acquainted. And the terms of an agreement and its true construction, for it may be very complicated, and the acts of the parties in relation to it are circumstances without knowledge of which reasonably brought home to the mind, no man can be said to intend consequences regarding the breach of the agreement.” 
        
       
      
    65 The above passage from Short, while obiter, has been cited with approval in a number of judgments. It is noteworthy that the passage does not include the necessity for the act, which induces the breach of contract, to be, itself, unlawful.  
     
      
    66 Further, it seems that an analysis of the cases would suggest that intention and knowledge are used almost interchangeably and certainly synonymously. In Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group (1995) 58 FCR 26, Lindgren J (with whom Lockhart and Tamberlin JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Linguistic confusion can arise in respect of the alleged tortfeasor’s state of mind with respect to breach of the contract. Both ‘intention’ and ‘knowledge’ have been used in this context. But a person’s ‘knowledge’ that what he is inducing will constitute a breach of contract and his ‘intention’ to induce a breach of contract by what he is doing refers to one and the same thing. After all, ex hypothesi, the alleged tortfeasor’s acts are intentional, a breach of contract occurs and the acts induce the breach. Against that background, ‘knowledge’ and ‘intention’ that the breach will result from the acts, do not signify any relevant distinction.” 
        
       
      
    67 His Honour goes on to say, after referring to Lumley v Gye, supra, and other cases:  
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, the authorities establish conclusively that the gravamen of the tort is intention. Although the requirement of knowledge of the contract is sometimes discussed as if it were a separate ingredient of the tort, it is in fact an aspect of intention. The requirement that the alleged tortfeasor have ‘sufficient knowledge of the contract’ is a requirement he have sufficient knowledge to ground an intention to interfere with contractual rights.  
        
       
       
        
        Both his intention to interfere with contractual rights and the necessary supporting knowledge of the contract refer to the ‘actual’ or ‘subjective’ state of mind of the alleged tortfeasor. …  
        
       
       
        
        Although an alleged tortfeasor must have ‘a fairly good idea’ that the contract benefits another in the relevant respect, knowledge of the contract may be sufficient  
        for the purpose of grounding the necessary intention to interfere with contractual rights 
         although the precise term breached is not known.” (emphasis supplied) ( 
        Allstate 
        ,  
        supra 
        , at 43) 
        
       
      
    68 The defendants knew of a contract in existence between Film Financial and Summit. But no action arises from any attempt to interfere (if there were any) with such a contract. The audit for Summit on The Blair Witch Project was completed. There was no breach of contract induced by any act of the defendants. The defendants also were aware of an arrangement between Film Financial and OFG in relation to Waking Ned Devine. On the basis of evidence of Mr Sapsford, it would be difficult for the Court to conclude that the defendants knew that a refusal to have Film Financial or Mr Sapsford conduct the audit would result in a breach of the contract between Film Financial and OFG. It needs to be recalled that, even Mr Sapsford takes the view, it is for OFG, at any stage, to determine whether an audit will proceed and who, if anybody, shall conduct it. Any such decision, it seems on the evidence of Mr Sapsford, related above, would not be a breach of the contract, if one existed, between OFG and Film Financial. As to the other films, there is simply no evidence of a contract or arrangement whatsoever. Even if there were a contractual relationship between Film Financial and the licensors, it had not proceeded even as far as had the Waking Ned Devine relationship, and the action of the plaintiff suffers from the same problem as exists in relation to Waking Ned Devine.  
     
      
    69 The plaintiff submits that the actions of the defendants led directly to the plaintiff breaching its contract. As already stated, those contracts are not before the Court. It is impossible to determine whether such contracts exist and whether or not they have been breached. On the understanding of the principal of the plaintiff, there is and can be no inference that there has been a breach of those contracts.  
     
      
    70 Film Financial further submits under this head, that the defendant’s actions were also unlawful because they were a direct breach of Becker Group’s contractual obligations in its distribution agreements. Film Financial point to the refusal of Becker Group to abide by the Arbitrator’s decision. The Arbitrator’s decision relevantly summarised above, makes clear that it is for the licensor to choose the auditor. It was not in breach of its contract, even after the decision of the Arbitrator, for Becker Group, or its agents, to request OFG to choose an auditor other than Mr Sapsford or Film Financial. After the Arbitrator’s decision, OFG, on the evidence, did not insist upon an audit by Film Financial.  
     
      
    71 Because of the existence of a relationship between Film Financial and OFG, the terms of which relationship are not before the Court, it is necessary to deal with the alternative situation, lest it be said that there was an intention to breach a contract, even though the terms were unknown. Even if that were the case, on the evidence before the Court it could not be said that damage was occasioned (see above at [53]). 
     
      
    72 For these reasons the claim insofar as it relies upon an interference with contractual rights is dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Interference with Economic Interests 
       
      
    73 Relying upon the judgment of the High Court in Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329, the plaintiff submits that there is an avenue available for a claim under the tort of unlawful interference with economic interest. I am not, at this stage, accepting that such a tort exists. The plaintiff acknowledged that the High Court in Sanders v Snell did not accept that the tort exists in Australia. Nevertheless it dealt with the argument that, if the tort does exist, it depends upon an interference with trade or business by an unlawful act. The High Court then dealt with whether the act was unlawful and rejected the claim on that basis. The High Court described the tort as “emerging”, largely in the United Kingdom. The rationale for the element of unlawfulness is to eschew the absurd result if that were not the case. As the High Court makes clear: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any person engaged in trade or commerce will daily act deliberately to further that trader’s economic interest by obtaining business that would otherwise go to a trade rival. The whole focus of the business of many, if not all, traders is to compete with trade rivals and by advancing their own economic interests, inevitably harm the economic interests of their rivals. In many cases the trader’s conduct will be directed specifically at a particular rival. But, if the means of competition employed are lawful, and those means cause no breach of obligation, there is no warrant for holding the trader liable to the rival for the economic consequences of the competitive conduct. The fact that the conduct is engaged in deliberately or is directed specifically at the person who suffers economic detriment is not enough to make the conduct tortious.” ( 
        Sanders v Snell 
         at [31]) 
        
       
      
    74 The doctrine of prima facie tort (Tutte v Buck (1909) 119 NW 946), also referred to as the “innominate tort” (British Airways Limited v Laker Airways [1984] QB 142; Dunlop v Woollahra Municipal Council [1982] AC 158; Lonrho v Shell Petroleum Limited [1982] AC 173), has never been adopted as an operating cause of action in Australia. (Sanders v Snell at [32]) 
     
      
    75 This, of course, does not mean that the plaintiff is not entitled to argue and have accepted, for the first time, a cause of action based upon those principles. In each other case in Australia in which the emerging tort has been pleaded, it has never been successful, because one or more of the elements proposed in that tort was absent.  
     
      
    76 Two particular judgments were relied upon by the plaintiff in supporting the existence of the cause of action in Australia. The first of them is Sid Ross Agency Pty Ltd v Actors and Announcers Equity Association (1970) 2 NSWR 47. That was a judgment of Else-Mitchell J at an interlocutory stage determining whether pleadings should be struck out. It was given ex-tempore (as the report makes clear) and the relevant passage is at pp 51-52 of the report. His Honour, after ruling on what was called the “third count” and being addressed on the fourth count, continued, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fourth count is sought to be struck out by the Summons and, in the alternative, further and better particulars are sought. That count substantially follows in its preliminary language, the terms of the third count [wrongful inducing of a breach of contract]; … there can, I think, be no doubt in the light of the authorities that have been referred to such as  
        Rookes v Barnard 
         …  
        Stratford v Lindley 
        ; … that a right of action is available to a person who suffers damage as a result of interference by another with his trade or business by unlawful means and that this may be so even though the interference does not entail the procurement of inducement of an actual breach of contract.” 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour proceeded to remark that it is not every use of unlawful means which allows or justifies an action for unlawful interference with economic or business interests and struck out the pleading on the basis that it inadequately specified a cause of action.  
     
      
    78 The second case upon which the plaintiff relies, in this area, is a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Pinky’s Pizza Ribs on the Run Pty Ltd v Pinky’s Seymour Pizza & Pasta Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-600. The passage dealing with this issue commences at page 44284. After comment about the manner in which the claim had been raised, Tadgell JA (with whom Phillips and Batt JJA agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be accepted that the common law recognises as an actionable wrong an interference with trade or business by unlawful means. Some of the authorities are usefully collected by Brooking J in  
        Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Australian Federation of Air Pilots 
         [1991] 1 VR 637 at 666-8. There is authority for the view that a plaintiff may establish commission of the tort without proving an intention on the part of the defendant to cause economic harm to the plaintiff. …Nevertheless, the better view at present seems to be that an essential ingredient of the tort is ‘the existence in the mind of the wrongdoer of a purpose or intention of inflicting injury on the plaintiff’ … The exact nature of the element of intention seems, however, not to have been definitely settled. There is authority for the view that the defendant must be proved to have had a predominant intention, when pursuing his cause of action, to injure the plaintiff rather than advance his own interests:  
        Barretts and Baird (Wholesale) Ltd v Institution of Professional Civil Servants 
         [1987] 1 IRLR 3, a decision of Henry J (QBD).  
        
       
       
        
        In the  
        Ansett 
         case,  
        supra 
        , Brooking J assumed (as I read it) that an intention on the part of the defendant to injure the plaintiff must be proved and considered whether the plaintiff must prove also that that was the defendant’s predominant intention. … 
        
       
       
        
        I think it is unnecessary here to investigate, as an ingredient of the tort of interference with trade or business by unlawful means, the extent of an intention on the part of the defendants to harm the plaintiffs. Whatever room for debate may exist on that matter, it is very plain that damage is the gist of the tort:  
        Ansett v AFAP 
         at 645 and the cases there cited. Just as the plaintiff’s passing off claims should fail for want of proof of substantial damage, any claim for the tort of interference with their businesses by the defendants by unlawful means should fail for the same reason. Moreover an injunction, which is the only remedy that the plaintiffs now seek, could not go without proof of damage that is irreparable, and there is certainly no indication of that.” 
        
       
      
    79 The defendants submit that there is no tort recognised in Australia of the kind here claimed. There is much force in the argument pressed by the defendants that “the cause of action alleged resembles that associated with the High Court’s decision in Beaudesert Shire Council v Smith (1966) 120 CLR 145 at 156 which provided a remedy to ‘a person who suffers harm or loss as inevitable consequence of the unlawful, intentional and positive acts of another’. The existence of this tort, however, was rejected by the High Court in Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307.” 
     
      
    80 There are significant differences between the economic tort claimed by the plaintiff and the basis of action in Beaudesert. Assuming, for the purposes of this discussion, that there exists a tort as proposed and it reflects the principles adumbrated by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Pinky’s, supra, it depends not only upon the inevitable consequence of an intentional act but an act which has as its purpose the causing of harm or loss. (See also Copyright Agency Limited v Haines [1982] 1 NSWLR 182 at 194, per McClelland J) 
     
      
    81 If such a tort exists, and for present purposes I assume that to be the case, it would seem that the statement by the Court of Appeal in Victoria is that the purpose of causing injury (predominant or otherwise) must be a purpose other than the advancing of the defendant’s own interests. If a broad tort exists of the kind here mentioned, there is much more scope for a broader defence of justification than operates with an interference with contractual relations. (See Zhu v Treasurer of NSW (2004) 218 CLR 530) 
     
      
    82 I will assume for the current analysis that such a tort exists, that justification must be confined to assertion of a superior right and deal with the issues accordingly. Then, on the evidence before the Court, there is an unlawful act in the refusal (pre-Arbitrator’s decision) to allow Film Financial to attend and audit in relation to Waking Ned Devine. That unlawful act was the breach of contract with OFG, being the defiance in the face of an insistence by OFG and the refusal to allow Film Financial access to property and records. In relation to no other contract can it be said that there is an unlawful act because in relation to no other contract was there an insistence that Film Financial perform the audit and in relation to no other contract was there a breach of contract by Becker Group which amounted to any arguable unlawfulness.  
     
      
    83 In those circumstances, two further obstacles arise in the making good of a claim of unlawful interference. On the basis of the analysis previously undertaken in relation to the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations, Film Financial failed to prove, even on the balance of probabilities, that damage arose from the conduct; for that reason the claim on this less-established tort must likewise fail.  
     
      
    84 The second obstacle would be a question of justification, if the claim had not fallen for want of damage. Confining justification, even in this new tort, to the kind of justification adumbrated by the High Court in Zhu, supra, the defendants have a good defence. I accept that the motive of the defendants was the protection of its own business. It considered the comment by Film Financial to be particularly damaging to its reputation and to its capacity to obtain further work from Summit and beyond Summit. The right that it asserted was a right to its property, being the premises it occupied and the documents and records of the business it possessed.  
     
      
       
        
        “[135] … statute apart, where reliance is placed on the defence of justification to protect the right which is equal or superior to the contractual right of the plaintiff, logic suggests that the protected equal right of the defendant will normally have a similar character to the right of the plaintiff – i.e. a quasi-proprietary character – while a superior right will be proprietary. Logic is a dangerous guide in relation to terms as subtle, fluid and lacking in fixed and uniformed criteria as ‘proprietary’ and ‘quasi-proprietary’, but Jordan CJ’s analysis of superior rights in  
        Independent Oil Industries Limited v Shell Company of Australia Limited 
         (1937) 37 SR (NSW) 394 at 415, certainly suggests that a right which is ‘superior’ to the plaintiff’s contractual right must be proprietary. … 
        
       
       
        
        [138] … Jordan CJ said justification in that sense rested on the principle that ‘an act which would in itself be wrongful as infringing some legal right of another person may be justified if shown to be no more than reasonably necessary for the protection of some actually existing superior legal right in the doer of the act’. He illustrated the operation of the principle thus: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘An occupier of land may, after notice, lawfully eject a trespasser and anyone may lawfully defend himself, by acts which would in other circumstances constitute the tort of assault.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The legal strength of the trespasser’s position could not be improved, and the legal strength of the occupier’s position could not be reduced, by the fact that the trespasser had entered the occupier’s land pursuant to a contract with the third party.” ( 
        Zhu 
        ,  
        supra 
        ) 
        
       
      
    85 Once permission to enter premises is denied to Film Financial (albeit in breach of contract with OFG) insofar as Film Financial uses particular personnel, and once access to documents is denied to Film Financial in those circumstances, the person to whom objection is taken is trespassing and is in breach of the proprietary rights of Becker Group. The remedy is for OFG to sue and obtain damages and/or injunctive relief. But, for the purposes of this proposed tort, the right to protect its property (and possibly including the proprietary right in the goodwill of the business) is a superior right to the contractual right asserted and will withstand the claim in tort by Film Financial whose rights are contractual only. 
     
      
    86 Given that I have found that the plaintiff has not proven damage, it is probably unnecessary, and obiter, for me to finally determine the question of justification. It is also unnecessary for me to determine that the tort proposed exists. If it does, its elements not been so proven.  
     
      
       
      Section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1976 
       
      
    87 As previously stated, the only provision of the Trade Practices Act upon which reliance is placed is s.51AA of the Act. Section 51AA provides a statutory prohibition on a corporation engaging in conduct which is unconscionable within the meaning of the ‘unwritten law’. It imports into the Trade Practices Act the principles in Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362; Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447 and the like. It requires an unconscientiousness in the conduct of a corporation in exploiting a “special disadvantage” that exists in the other party to a transaction. It has been defined in a number of ways by the High Court.  
     
      
    88 In Blomley v Ryan it was said to arise: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whenever one party to a transaction is at a special disadvantage in dealing with the other party because illness, ignorance, inexperience, impaired faculties, financial need or other circumstances affect his ability to conserve his own interests, and the other party unconscientiously takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in his hands.” (per Kitto J at 415) 
         
        
       
      
    89 In Amadio, Mason J at 461 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Relief on the ground of unconscionable conduct will be granted when unconscientious advantage is taken of an innocent party whose will is overborne so that it is not independent and voluntary just as it will be granted when such advantage is taken of an innocent party who, though not deprived of an independent and voluntary will, is unable to make a worthwhile judgment as to what is in his best interests.”  
        
       
      
    90 At 474 of Amadio, his Honour Deane J described unconscionable conduct as occurring when:  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) A party to a transaction was under a special disability in dealing with another party with the consequence that there was an absence of any reasonable degree of equality between them; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) That disability was sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie, unfair or ‘unconscientious’ that he procure or accept the weaker party’s assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which he procured or accepted it.  
        
       
       
        
        Where such circumstances are shown to have existed, an onus is cast upon the stronger party to show that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable.” 
        
       
      
    91 Unconscionable conduct does not mean unfair conduct. It occurs only when there is a special disability “which seriously affects the ability of the innocent party to make a judgment as to his or her best interests’. (ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 51, per Gleeson CJ at 62 [5]) 
     
      
    92 In enacting s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act, the legislature has not extended the common law, it has, for federal legislative purposes, enacted it. In the current circumstances, Film Financial does not suffer a special disadvantage of the kind that would bring it within the provisions of s.51AA. Further, it has not been party to a transaction with the defendant Becker Group. The licensors on whose behalf Film Financial were gaining access to premises were the parties to the transaction and they, at least on one view, had a much stronger bargaining position than did Becker Group. I do not here suggest that a weaker bargaining position is, of itself, a special disadvantage of the kind contemplated in unconscionable conduct, but a stronger bargaining position is generally the antithesis of any suggestion of unconscionability towards the stronger party.  
     
      
    93 In those circumstances it is unnecessary for me to determine whether s.80 and 82 of the Trade Practices Act extend the right to injunctive relief and/or damages to a person not involved in the transaction.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    94 As can be seen from the above, none of the bases upon which the plaintiff claims damage is established. I have paid little or no attention thus far to the question of injunctive relief.  
     
      
    95 Injunctive relief was not separately argued other than on the basis of established interference with contractual rights on an ongoing basis. (See Woolley v Dunford (1972) 3 SASR 243) There is, arguably, a basis upon which an injunction could issue restraining the defendants from interfering with audit contracts obtained by the plaintiffs in the future. Such an injunction would operate only in relation to contracts that have, in fact, been formed and of which, as with Waking Ned Devine, the defendants were aware. Given the express attitude of the defendants, it is at least possible, notwithstanding the lack of evidence in this case, that such a situation will arise. On the evidence adduced in these proceedings, particularly on damage; even if injunctive relief were available as an exercise of discretion I would not grant it.  
     
      
    96 The Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
    1. Judgment for the Defendants;2. The proceedings are otherwise dismissed;3. The plaintiff will pay the defendants’ costs as agreed or assessed.

      JUDGMENT - On application re Indictment 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: At the end of 2005, the accused pleaded “Not Guilty” to an indictment alleging the commission of a number of offences including offences against ss 101.5 and 101.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. On 15 December 2005 Mr Boulten SC, who with Mr Lange of counsel appears for the accused, argued that the indictment was bad for duplicity in relation to counts 2, 3 and 4. On 23 December 2005, I made a pre-trial ruling the broad effect of which was, subject to one matter, that the indictment did not contain overt or latent duplicities and that accordingly the prosecutor was not required to elect to narrow the scope of the charges. 
     
      
    2 On 7 February 2006, the Crown presented a fresh indictment. The accused pleaded not guilty to each of the four charges in the new indictment. These charges were: - 
     
      
       
        
        1. On or about 3 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Faheem Khalid Lodhi did collect documents, namely two maps of the Australian electricity supply system which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, namely bombing part of the system, knowing the said connection. 
        
       
       
        
        2. On or about 10 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Faheem Khalid Lodhi did an act, namely sought information concerning the availability of materials capable of being used for the manufacture of explosives, in preparation for, or planning a terrorist act, namely causing the death or serious physical harm to a person or persons unknown or causing serious damage to property unknown. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On or about 24 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Faheem Khalid Lodhi did make a document, namely a set of aerial photographs of Australia defence establishments which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, namely the bombing of one or another of the establishments, knowing the said connection. 
        
       
       
        
        4. On or about 26 October 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Faheem Khalid Lodhi possessed a thing, namely a document containing information concerning the ingredients for and the method of manufacture of poisons, explosives, detonators and incendiary devices and concerning “intelligence” which was connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act namely causing the death or serious physical harm to a person or persons unknown or causing serious damage to property unknown, knowing the said connection. 
        
       
      
    3 The first and third counts in the indictment allege offences against s 101.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (“Criminal Code”). Count 2 of the indictment alleges an offence s 101.6 of the Criminal Code. Count 4 alleges an offence against s 101.4 of the Criminal Code. 
     
      
    4 Mr Boulten SC applied to quash the new indictment. First, it was sought to quash counts 2, 3 and 4 on the grounds that they were bad for duplicity. Secondly, the accused applied for an order quashing counts 1 to 4 on the ground that they failed to specify all essential factual elements. 
     
      
    5 During the course of argument, Mr Maidment SC indicated that he would seek leave to make a number of alterations to the indictment with a view to providing clearer particulars of the matters alleged. Subject to these contingent alterations, I ruled in favour of the Crown and against the arguments advanced by Mr Boulten SC on behalf of the accused. It was my view that the indictment, in its suggested amended form, should not be quashed. 
     
      
    6 An appeal was taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal from my decision. This was heard on 24 March 2006 and judgment was given on 13 April 2006. Spigelman CJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Sully J agreed) ruled that the indictment was not bad for duplicity. The Court determined, however, that the indictment failed to specify the necessary factual elements of the offence in relation to each charge. For that reason, the Court ordered that the indictment be quashed. 
     
      
    7 On 18 April 2006 the Crown presented a new indictment. The charge, in its new form, endeavoured to include the factual elements which the Court of Criminal Appeal had found to be lacking in the earlier indictment. 
     
      
    8 Mr Boulten SC immediately made a fresh application pursuant to s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The application was to quash the new indictment. There were essentially three bases for the application. There were, however, two limbs to the first argument. The first point was that the indictment was bad for duplicity and this involved precise repetition of the arguments Mr Boulten had advanced unsuccessfully before the Court of Criminal Appeal. The second limb of this argument was that in certain new respects there was a latent duplicity in the new indictment. The second major argument suggested that the indictment, in certain respects, charged offences that were not known to law. The third major argument was a general argument that the new indictment was bad because it lacked, in effect, particularity. Mr Boulten SC argued that the terms of the indictment was so broad that they resulted in a situation where the indictment was completely unsatisfactory for its intended purpose. 
     
      
    9 As extensive and complicated arrangements had been made for the empanelment of a jury on 19 April 2006, it became necessary for me to give a prompt decision in relation to the application made on behalf of the accused. For that reason, on the morning on 19 April 2006, I determined that I would not make the order sought on behalf of the accused and I indicated that the indictment should stand in its presently amended form. (I should indicate that during argument the Crown had sought leave to delete one paragraph from each of the charges and this amendment was permitted). These then are my reasons for the decision refusing to quash the new indictment. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - Duplicity 
       
      
    10 The first limb of Mr Boulten’s argument may be dealt with briefly. It is sufficient to say that I am bound by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal and, in that regard, I find that the new indictment, insofar as the accused has repeated earlier arguments made, is not bad for duplicity. 
     
      
    11 In relation to the second limb of the argument on duplicity, it may be convenient if I set out in these reasons count 1 in the indictment. The same argument was made in respect of each of the counts and there is no need for me to set these out in full in this decision. Count 1 is in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth of Australia, who prosecutes in this behalf of Her Majesty, charges in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 19 April 2006 that

          (d) in circumstances where the action to be done or threatened would not be advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action of a kind not intended to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            i. cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           ii. cause a person’s death; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            iii. endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking action; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            iv. create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The point of attack appears in paragraph (b) as set out above. Mr Boulten SC argues that the two alternatives represented by the matters in (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) reveal a latent duplicity. I do not believe this to be so. I will not repeat the statement of principles applicable to the duplicity argument or the analysis I conducted in the earlier decisions. The analysis, however, found favour in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
    13 In his judgment in Lodhi v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 121 Spigelman CJ said at paras 88 and 89: 
     
      
       
        
        “88. I have set out the counts in the Indictment above. That part of each of Counts 2, 3 and 4 discussed under the heading of “Duplicity” above, concerned with the results of the terrorist act in terms of death, serious physical harm or serious damage to property represents the identification of some of the list of matters set out in subs (2) of the definition of terrorist act which are applied by par (a) of that definition. The Crown has, accordingly, pleaded in each count one part of par (a), relating to subs (2) of the definition. It has not pleaded the second part of par (a) namely the proposition that the alleged actions did not fall within subsection (3). Nor has it pleaded the “intention” referred to in either par (b) or par (c) of that definition. The issue is whether or not these matters constitute an essential element of the offence. In my opinion they do. 
        
       
       
        
        89. This may not prove to be of great practical significance because on my above reasoning, in the context of dealing with the duplicity argument, the approach in  
        Romeyko 
         would apply equally to the respective component parts of the definition of “terrorist act”. An action falling within subs (2) will frequently be motivated by more than one “cause”. Motivations of a “political, religious or ideological” character frequently overlap. Similarly, an action falling within (2) of the definition will often tend to coerce or influence by intimidation more than one government, as well as intimidate the public or a section of the public. Contrary to the submissions of the Applicant, the further definition of the offence may not be of significance in restricting the scope of admissible evidence, Nevertheless, they should be so specified as an essential ingredient”. 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Boulten SC suggested that these comments by Spigelman CJ did not specifically relate to the duplicity argument but rather to the argument regarding the omission of essential elements. I do not consider that Mr Boulten’s argument carries much weight in this regard because it is clear to me that Spigelman CJ’s observations have a plain resonance for the duplicity argument as well. Moreover, as Spigelman CJ observed in Lodhi at para 74 the true distinction is that identified by Bray CJ in Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529 at 552: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow.” 
        
       
      
    15 At para 75 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the scope and nature of the legislative scheme, concerned as it is with terrorist acts, which recent experience suggests are likely to have all three effects at the same time, Parliament intended to create a single offence with one or more of the specified characteristics”. 
        
       
      
    16 The reasoning of both Bray CJ and Spigelman CJ requires, in relation to the present matter, a conclusion that sub-paragraph (c) of s 100.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act intended the creation of one offence only, and that this is so even where the act or threatened action embraces one or more of the matters referred in the sub-section. 
     
      
    17 To take an example: recently, there was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv outside a food store. There could be no doubt that the act was intended to coerce or influence by intimidation the Israeli government. Equally, there could be no doubt that the act was intended to intimidate the public or a section of the public of Tel Aviv. Placing that example in the present context, it is clear that relevantly, the action or threat of action involved in the suicide bombing was one that might be properly said to have occurred with the intention of one or more of the specified characteristics identified in sub-paragraph (c) of s 100.1(1) of the Criminal Code. This results however, for the reasons, I have given, in the creation of one offence and not two. The same reasoning applies to this aspect of the definition of “terrorist act” in each of the remaining charges in the indictment. 
     
      
    18 I turn now to mention the second argument raised by Mr Boulten SC. This focussed on paragraph (c)(vi) in each count of the indictment. The Crown accepted that there may have been a problem in this regard and sought the Court’s leave to amend the indictment to exclude, in effect, the paragraph under discussion in each count. No objection was raised to this amendment and the amendment was subsequently made. The amendment, in each case, appeared to me to address satisfactorily senior counsel’s second main argument. 
     
      
    19 The final argument raised by Mr Boulten related to the lack of focus and particularity in the new indictment. Mr Boulten argued that an indictment is supposed to “crystallise” the essential factual ingredients. But in circumstances where all that is repeated is every possible factual ingredient contemplated by the section, there is, he submitted, in fact no focus on the essential factual ingredients. Finally, Mr Boulten argued that the indictment was now “a bad indictment”. He asserted that it was pleaded in the way it was because the Crown was simply unable to say what it was that the accused was preparing to do. He was particularly critical of this situation in relation to counts 2 and 4. 
     
      
    20 My response to Mr Boulten’s argument is this: first, the accused had persuaded the Court of Criminal Appeal that the original indictment, although expressed in simple enough terms, did not set out all the essential factual ingredients. The new indictment now does set out those essential factual ingredients. Secondly, it is inevitable in such a situation that the new indictment will be far longer and more cumbersome in expression than the original document. That is necessarily the case having regard to the essential ingredients appearing in the definition section of the Criminal Code. Thirdly, I do not accept that there has been any alteration in the essential nature of the Crown case. It has always been the obligation of the Crown to prove the essential ingredients of each charge beyond reasonable doubt. It would have been, and still is, the duty of the Court, whatever the form of the indictment, to direct the jury in relation to the existence and nature of the essential elements of each charge. It remains the duty of the Court to give specific directions about the obligation placed on the Crown to prove each of those ingredients beyond reasonable doubt. Finally, in this regard, it has always been the Crown’s case that the alleged preparatory acts engaged in by the accused arose in the context of a situation where the ultimate target for the carrying out of the act may not have been selected. 
     
      
    21 The various matters I have identified in relation to Mr Boulten’s third submission lead me to a conclusion that the submission against the indictment should fail. These then are my reasons for the decision given on Wednesday, 19 April 2006.

     JJB v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Subject to the following additional observations I agree with the reasons of Kirby J and to the orders his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    2 His Honour refers to the observations of Deane J and McHugh J in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 as “the extended Longman direction”. This is a convenient shorthand but must no be confused with the Longman warning which has authoritative force. The observations by Deane J and McHugh J are just that – observations. They have never been given authoritative force either from the High Court or from any intermediate court of criminal appeal.  
     
      
    3 Their Honour’s observations are based on assumptions about child psychology which are widely held but which are not necessarily well founded. Many judges share a conventional wisdom about human behaviour, which may represent the limitations of their background. This has been shown to be so in sexual assault cases. (See R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 367-368.) 
     
      
    4 Legislative intervention was required to overcome the tendency of male judges to treat sexual assault complainants as prone to be unreliable. The observations of Deane J and McHugh J in Longman reflect a similar legal tradition that treated children as unreliable witnesses. In the past both categories of witnesses required corroboration.  
     
      
    5 Jurors may also reflect these widely held assumptions about children, as they may also do about sexual assault complainants. Such prejudices may be reinforced by the profession and the bench in the conduct of a criminal case. (See J A Quas et al “Do Jurors ‘Know’ What Isn’t So about Child Witnesses?” (2005) 29 Law and Human Behaviour 425.) 
     
      
    6 There is a significant debate as to whether expert evidence should be admissible about the ability of children to give accurate evidence, especially in child sexual assault proceedings. See, most recently, Uniform Evidence Laws Report ALRC Report 102, NSWLRC Report 112, VLRC Final Report, December 2005 at 9.138-9.158; Criminal Justice Sexual Offences Task Force Responding to Sexual Assault Final Report, Sydney December 2005 pp165-176. These two recent reports refer to a range of earlier studies and reports. They also outline the legislation that already exists in some jurisdictions to permit such evidence and make recommendations for further legislative intervention. 
     
      
    7 There is a substantial body of psychological research indicating that children, even very young children, give reliable evidence. (See eg the references in Ligertwood Australian Evidence (4th ed) LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia 2004 para 7.31 fn 10 and 11.) These are complex issues, as reflected in reviews of the research on the ability of young children to distinguish fantasy from reality (see J D Woolley “Thinking About Fantasy: Are Children Fundamentally Different Thinkers and Believers from Adults” (1997) 68 Child Development 991; M Taylor “The Role of Creative Control and Culture in Children’s Fantasy/Reality Judgments” (1997) 68 Child Development 1015; T Sharon and J D Woolley “Do Monsters Dream? Young Children’s Understanding of the Fantasy/Reality Distinction” (2004) 24 British Journal of Developmental Psychology 293 at 294-296). The same is true of research about a child’s ability to accurately recall stressful events (see Richard J McNally Remembering Trauma Harvard Uni P, Cambridge Mass 2003 at pp58-62).  
     
      
    8 The complexity of these issues is not reflected in the observations of Deane J and McHugh J in Longman, which should, accordingly, be treated with caution.  
     
      
    9 KIRBY J: JJB (""the appellant"") stood trial before Nicholson DCJ and a jury in the District Court at Taree. The indictment may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         That between 6.9.87 and 31.12.87 he indecently assaulted the complainant (a child then aged 6 years). 
         
        (s61E(1) Crimes Act 1900) (""the Act""). 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2 & 3:  
        That between 1.6.91 and 30.10.91 he indecently assaulted the complainant, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she then being less than 16 years (being 10 years). 
         
        (s61M(1) of the Act). 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4 & 5:  
        That between 1.4.92 and 31.12.92 he had sexual intercourse without consent with a person between the age of 10 and 16 years (the complainant then being 10 or 11 years). 
         
        (s66C(1) of the Act). 
        
       
      
    10 The charges were based upon the complaint of YM, a woman aged 23 years at the time of trial (born June 1981). She was the niece of the appellant. Her father was the appellant's brother. YM gave no evidence in respect of count 2. His Honour therefore directed a verdict of acquittal in respect of that count. On the remaining counts, the jury returned a verdict of ""not guilty"" in respect of counts 1 and 3 and ""guilty"" in respect of counts 4 and 5. The appeal, therefore, is directed to the appellant's conviction in respect of counts 4 and 5. There is no appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    11 The Notice of Appeal relies upon one ground, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
        : There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned trial judge's failure to adequately warn the jury of the danger in convicting the appellant in that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury as to the forensic disadvantage suffered by the appellant in his ability to test the evidence as a result of the delay; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the trial judge failed to warn the jury of the fragility of youthful recollection and the possibility of the distortion of memory over time; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the jury were not properly warned of the forensic difficulties to the appellant in meeting the Crown case. 
        
       
      
    12 It is acknowledged that no complaint was made by counsel during the trial. Leave is therefore required (Rule 4 of the Rules under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 
     
      
    13 Before dealing with the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, I should refer to the evidence in support of each count. 
     
      
       
      The alleged offences. 
       
      
    14 The complainant lived in the country with her family. The appellant was an itinerant worker. When the complainant was young, the appellant used to stay with the family overnight from time to time. There were occasions when he would stay for a week, or even months. 
     
      
    15 In respect of count 1, the complainant said that she was in kindergarten and six years old when she changed schools. There was an occasion when, at the new house, there was a barbeque. Having been outside, she entered the house and passed through the kitchen. She saw the appellant sitting at a table in the kitchen. Nobody else was in the room. Her uncle asked her to sit on his lap, which she did. She was wearing pyjamas. He touched her on the thigh and then rubbed her vagina on the outside of her pyjamas. He told her, ""nobody has to know"". She jumped down and went outside. She said nothing to anyone. She gave as her reason that she was afraid that no-one would believe her. She said she was ashamed that it might have been her fault. 
     
      
    16 Her parents separated in late 1990. Count 3 related to an incident after the separation. The complainant was living with her mother, visiting her father at weekends. She was then ten years old. The appellant came into the bathroom when she was having a bath. He unzipped his trousers and took out his erect penis. He reached for her hand which he placed on his penis. She said that the incident occurred a month or two before the death of a family friend. There was evidence that the friend died on 8 August 1991. Again, she did not tell anyone, providing the same reasons that she gave in respect of the first incident. 
     
      
    17 The next incident occurred a year or so later. Her father moved to a flat in Harrington known as ""The Breakers"". The complainant and her sister each had their own bedroom. Their father slept on the lounge. She said she woke up one night to find the appellant in bed alongside her. She was wearing a nightgown with underpants. She felt him touching her vagina. He pulled the underpants to one side and inserted his fingers in her vagina (count 4). According to the complainant, the appellant ""somehow"" then rolled her over and was on top of her. He was naked. By some means he removed her underpants, although she could not remember how that occurred. He inserted his penis in her vagina and moved it back and forth. She started to cry. He put his hand over her mouth and continued having intercourse. He then dressed and left the room (count 5). 
     
      
    18 The complainant said that she then went to the bathroom. She noticed that she was bleeding from the vagina. She had a bath. She said that she had not then commenced menstruation. 
     
      
    19 In cross examination the complainant acknowledged that, at an earlier trial (which had been aborted), she had said that she had a shower. She also acknowledged that she had told the police in 1996, when she first complained, that she did not know whether the appellant was wearing clothes. She said to the police at that time that she started menstruating in Year 5, which was 1992. Her statement of 10 September 1996 was tendered in re-examination. She said in that statement that she had a bath, rather than a shower. 
     
      
    20 The complainant's evidence in respect of counts 1 to 4 was unsupported. There was, however, evidence capable of being regarded as corroboration in respect of count 5, the allegation of penile penetration. Her father gave evidence that, on 1 April 1992, he moved to ""The Breakers"" with his daughters, including YM. His brother came to the flat and, on a couple of occasions, stayed the night. He eventually barred his brother from the flat for a number of reasons, including drunkenness.  
     
      
    21 When the complainant gave evidence, she said that she thought that after her bath she left the water in the bathtub. Her father recalled an occasion where he saw blood in the bath. He said this: (T60) (17.2.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: When you were living at The Breakers Flats did you notice anything out of the ordinary at all in relation to the bathroom? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And what was that? 
         
        A. Blood in the bottom of the bath. I'd just cleaned my bath totally spotlessly, bathroom spotless and next morning when I got up I went in there and there was water in the bath and blood in the bottom of the bath. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to give us some idea of the quantity of the blood that you saw? 
         
        A. There was like two little wavy lines about yea long each.""  
        
       
      
    22 The wavy lines were two or three inches long. The complainant's father said he did not ask his daughter whether she had commenced her periods. He added: (T64) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. (The complainant) was very upset and wanted to go straight to her mother's that morning."" 
        
       
      
    23 When cross examined, the appellant acknowledged that he had not included this detail in his first statement to the police. It was supplied in his second statement, which he made after having read his daughter's statement. 
     
      
    24 A further witness, Gregory James Durant, gave evidence. He had known the appellant since childhood. He used to drink with the appellant and a friend at the local hotel from time to time. Mr Durant recalled an incident ""around 1993"". He, the appellant and Andrew McPherson were at the Harrington Hotel. They were sharing a drink and playing pool. After about two hours there was an argument. The appellant said, ""I've given (the complainant) a head job"". He added, according to Mr Durant, that he either ""had fucked her"" or ""he was going to fuck her"". Mr Durant said that he grabbed the appellant under the arms. He walked him outside. He then punched him in the head. He swore at him a number of times and then left the hotel. According to Mr Durant, the appellant rang him the following day. He said, ""it didn't happen, we were pissed"". He ""was only joking"". However, Mr Durant said that the appellant appeared normal. Mr Durant added that he, personally, did not feel ""pissed"". 
     
      
    25 It was put to Mr Durant in cross examination that the reason for the fight was that he (Durant) had given the complainant's sister a bottle of bourbon for her fourteenth birthday (T89). Mr Durant denied that suggestion. He agreed that Mr McPherson was about eight feet away when the appellant had made his remarks.  
     
      
    26 Mr Andrew McPherson gave evidence. He recalled being at the hotel with the appellant and Mr Durant. He had not witnessed any altercation between the two of them or ""any event leading up to it"". He said they were all pretty drunk. He added that he left just before dark. He later learned that there had been a fight. 
     
      
       
      Flight of the accused. 
       
      
    27 The complainant made a statement to the police on 10 September 1996. Her older sister also made a complaint. The appellant was arrested in Queensland on 24 September 1996. The assertions of the complainant were put to him and were denied. On 26 September 1996, the appellant was committed for trial at the Murwillumbah Local Court. On 30 April 1997, the trial was fixed for 2 June 1997. On 2 June the trial was called on before Solomon DCJ. However, the appellant did not appear. On 4 June 1997, Judge Solomon signed a bench warrant for the arrest of the appellant. 
     
      
    28 The appellant was ultimately arrested in Queensland in November 2004. He was then held in custody pending the trial. On 14 February 2005, he pleaded guilty to the charges arising from the complaint of the complainant's sister. However, he pleaded not guilty to the charges arising from the complaint of YM. The trial in respect of those charges proceeded. On 15 February 2005, the Crown foreshadowed that he wished to place before the jury the chronology culminating in the present charges, including the appellant's failure to appear. The Crown said this: (T1) (15.2.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""But, your Honour, I submit, the delay between September 1996 and today needs to be explained, and what I'd be seeking to do is to lead evidence of the accused's failure to attend in June 1997 and his arrest in November 2004. I submit that that seven year delay ought to be explained that way. My friend opposes the evidence being put in that fashion."" 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour immediately recognised the implications of this material for the Longman direction (Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79) which he would be required to give. He addressed the following question to Mr Golding, an experienced counsel then appearing for the appellant: (T2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: One of the problems, Mr Golding, that arises is that I will be required to direct the jury as to the disadvantages that the accused faces as a consequence of delay; difficulty in establishing alibi evidence, for instance, and the like. Those directions appear to be predicated upon a proposition that the delay was no fault of the accused's. If there is any complaint made about the delay in complaint, one of the consequences is that that brings out also a direction that one of the problems with a delay in complaint is that the accused can be prejudiced as a consequence of the delay, sheeting home, as it were, the injustice of the accused having to face a trial 14 years after the event. It is also one of the reasons why I give a warning about the unsupported evidence of the complainant, that it has caused - that one of the factors is the delay. Those warnings, without some counterbalance for the last seven years, really amount to a free kick for the accused in a situation where he is hardly entitled to it. That is my concern, and if you can address that I might not be as concerned about your position as I otherwise would be."" 
        
       
      
    30 Counsel responded as follows, alluding to count 1 (which was said to have occurred in 1987) and perhaps counts 2 and 3 (which were said to have occurred in 1991): (T2) 
     
      
       
        
        "" ... can I submit that it may be possible to tailor it in a way which accommodates my concerns and sufficiently protects my client's position because the very first of the - in fact I suppose it's fair to say that the first two of the incidents - that's the kindergarten incident and the bathtub incident at Harrington - they had a bit of age on them in any event by the time he was arrested."" 
        
       
      
    31 The following exchange then took place: (T2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: As I say, you're entitled to seven years delay but you're not entitled to 14 years delay, and there is a huge difference, particularly bearing in mind - I think I would allow evidence to be led of the committal, that is, that there was a committal in 1996 or whenever it was, because that would allow me to terminate the period of delay, because thereafter it seems to me that you are on notice that you have to defend the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        GOLDING: I was obliquely trying to get to that direction, your Honour. I was rather fixing on perhaps the time of the arrest and the conversation. The committal is probably a more appropriate and formal point ... that would then give me the benefit of the delay which I'm entitled to warnings about without taking advantage of something which is clearly my fault."" 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour added: (T3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: I mean, clearly he is entitled to the benefit of delay that was not in any way attributable to the accused and he is far less entitled to the benefit of any delay that is attributable at least in part to the accused. I mean, there may be some other mechanism but it seems to me that if you were permitted to lead evidence of the arrest and committal in 1996 --  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That sort of puts an end to the delay period."" 
        
       
      
    33 The discussion ended with an agreement as to how the matter should be dealt with in front of the jury. His Honour said this: (T4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""So if you have the committal and there are denials and you show them to the Crown, either you or he can lead them out of the police officer's mouth and then the jury will think that the committal is significant because it was the administrative thing - and I'll tell them all that. And then we may not even need to go into what happened thereafter. You're simply interested in, as I understand it, getting it affixed that the accused knew from 1996 that he was going to be put on trial."" 
        
       
      
    34 The Crown told his Honour that he did not rely upon the evidence as ""flight"", demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. He recognised that the appellant's failure to appear in June 1997 could relate to either or both sets of charges which he then faced, namely, those of YM or those of her sister. 
     
      
    35 The first trial was aborted soon after it began. The second trial commenced on Wednesday 16 February 2005. The Crown opened and then called Detective Sergeant Susanne Rode-Saunders. Det Rode-Saunders gave evidence in accordance with the agreement that had been reached. She said that the appellant had been arrested in Queensland, where he had been living, on 24 September 1996. The allegations of YM were put to him and were denied. He was thereafter committed to stand trial on 26 September 1996. Det Sgt Rode-Saunders said that they then ""met"" the appellant in Brisbane on 26 November 2004 and accompanied him back to New South Wales. His Honour explained to the jury the nature of committal proceedings. The detective was not cross examined. 
     
      
       
      The  
      Longman 
       warning. 
       
      
    36 The Notice of Appeal, para (a) (forensic disadvantage arising from an inability to test the complainant's evidence) and para (c) (forensic difficulty in the appellant meeting the Crown case) are both aspects of what has been termed the Longman warning. Paragraph (b) (the fragility of youthful recollection) deals with what is sometimes termed ""the extended Longman warning"", where the incident which forms the basis of the charge is dependant upon the recollection of a child. 
     
      
    37 Before examining his Honour's summing up, it may be useful to be clear about what he was obliged to say in conformity with Longman v The Queen and the cases that have followed. 
     
      
    38 The delay in Longman v The Queen exceeded 24 years. The complainant, a 32 year old woman when she gave evidence, described incidents which took place when she was a six year old child. She said that her stepfather indecently assaulted her. Counsel for the accused asked the trial Judge to warn the jury of the danger of acting upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. He declined to do so and Longman was convicted. However, the Court set aside the convictions and ordered a new trial. Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said this: (Longman v The Queen (supra) at p91) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning be given to them: see 
         Reg v Spencer 
         [1987] AC at p 141 That factor was the applicant's loss of those means of testing the complainant's allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant's story or confirming the applicant's denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant's recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see  
        Jago v District Court (NSW) 
         (1989) 168 CLR 23) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient."" 
        
       
      
    39 This passage has become the source of the Longman warning. The message was repeated and reinforced in two cases that followed. In Crampton v The Queen  (2000) 206 CLR 161, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ incorporated into their encapsulation of the test the words ""test and meet the evidence of the complainant"" (at p181), being the words which appear respectively in paras (a) and (c) of the Notice of Appeal. Their Honours said this: (at 181 para 45) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant."" 
        
       
      
    40 They emphasised: (at 181 para 45) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions."" 
        
       
      
    41 See also Doggett v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 343, Gaudron and Callinan JJ at 356, para 51. 
     
      
    42 The High Court, having spoken on three occasions on the same issue, there followed a number of appeals where the warning had not been given, or was given in terms said to have been deficient. In R v BWT (2002) 54 NSWLR 241, Sully J (Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreeing) helpfully sought to provide a summary of the principles which had emerged. Where there had been substantial delay, there must be a warning, not simply a comment or a caution. It must be correctly focused and framed. It must identify particular problems which delay may have occasioned to the accused. It must not be simply a repetition of counsel's arguments, but must have the unmistakeable authority of the court (at 273/4). The terms of the warning, Sully J suggested, must cover the following propositions: (at 273) 
     
      
       
        
        ""...  
        first, 
         that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested;  
        secondly 
        , that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone;  
        thirdly 
        ,  
        that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy;  
        fourthly 
        , that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care;  
        fifthly 
        , that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant's evidence; and  
        sixthly 
        , that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant's evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction."" 
        
       
      
    43 The formulation by Sully J has since been adopted in a number of cases (SJB  (2002) 129 A Crim R 572; R v GS [2003] NSWCCA 73; R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427). However, some courts, and some judges, have seen the need for greater flexibility, when assessing compliance with the Longman requirements, than R v BWT would appear to allow. In R v DGB (2002) 133 A Crim R 227, Howie J (Meagher JA and Simpson J agreeing) said this: (at 234/5 para 30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the present case, I am unpersuaded that it was necessary, either as a matter of law or in order to ensure a fair trial to the appellant, that the trial judge use the phrase 'dangerous to convict' in warning the jury as to the approach to be taken when assessing the complainant's evidence. No such warning was sought by an apparently competent defence counsel."" 
        
       
      
    44 The approach in Western Australia has been similar (Christophers v The Queen (2000) 23 WAR 106 at [37]; Crisafio v The Queen (2003) 27 WAR 169 at [1], [20]-[31]; RBK v The Queen [2004] WASCA 216 at [34], [99]; Angliss v The State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 162 at [15]). In R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427, the majority (Sully and Hulme JJ) determined that the warning which had been given (which, amongst other things, failed to use the words ""dangerous to convict"") did not conform with the requirements of Longman. Spigelman CJ disagreed. He analysed the warning which had been given observing first, that it was a warning and not a comment; secondly, that her Honour had added the authority and weight of the court to her instructions; thirdly, that the trial judge had identified why it was necessary to administer a warning, namely, that delay (between 1989 and 2002) had adversely affected the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing the prosecution evidence or by adducing evidence; fourthly, that her Honour had expressly linked the warning to the task which the jury was required to perform, requiring them to take account of the delay in making the critical assessment about the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant. The Chief Justice added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[13] It is wrong to treat any judicial statement, even in a judgment of the High Court, as the equivalent of a statutory formula. The issue is whether or not the critical features of the  
        Longman 
         warning were, as a matter of substance, transmitted to the jury. In my opinion they were."" 
        
       
       
      The extended  
      Longman 
       warning. 
       
      
    45 As mentioned, the complainant in Longman was a six year old child when the indecent assaults were said to have taken place. In that context, two judges specifically commented upon the fragility of such evidence. Deane J said this: (at 101) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... The possibility of child fantasy about sexual matters, particularly in relation to occurrences when the child is half-asleep or between periods of sleep, cannot be ignored. The borderline between fantasy and reality can be an uncertain one. Contemporaneous questioning of the child may distinguish fantasy from reality. The long passage of time can harden fantasy or semi-fantasy into the absolute conviction of reality. So to say is not to suggest that the allegations of the complainant in the present case arose from fantasy or semi-fantasy. It is simply to explain why it seems to me that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the complainant's evidence of the alleged offences which was not given until so long after their alleged occurrence required to be scrutinized with very great care indeed. It was not merely a matter of whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was an honest witness and that the applicant was not. It was a question of the intrinsic reliability of the only evidence which was capable of sustaining a finding of the applicant's guilt."" 
        
       
      
    46 McHugh J made similar observations. He said: (at 107/8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The fallibility of human recollection and the effect of imagination, emotion, prejudice and suggestion on the capacity to 'remember' is well documented. The longer the period between an 'event' and its recall, the greater the margin for error. Interference with a person's ability to 'remember' may also arise from talking or reading about or experiencing other events of a similar nature or from the person's own thinking or recalling. Recollection of events which occurred in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and is also subject to the possibility that it may not even be genuine: Hunter,  
        Memory 
        , rev ed (1964), pp 269-270. 
        
       
       
        
        No matter how honest the recollection of the complainant in this case, the long period of delay between her formal complaint and the occurrence of the alleged events raised a significant question as to whether her recollection could be acted upon safely. The likelihood of error was increased by the circumstances in which the complainant said the incidents occurred. The opportunity for error in recalling, twenty years later, two incidents of childhood which are alleged to have occurred as the complainant awoke, and then pretended to be asleep, are obvious. Experience derived from forensic contests, experimental psychology and autobiography demonstrates only too clearly how utterly false the recollections of honest witnesses can be. Certainly, some incident or accumulation of incidents seems to have affected the complainant's attitude to her stepfather. She testified that, because of his conduct towards her in sexual matters, 'I don't hate him but I do hate what he's done and the problems it's caused in my life'. However, the existence of this feeling towards the applicant increased, rather than decreased, the need to examine carefully whether the complainant's honest recollection of events concerning the applicant was not distorted by this hatred."" 
        
       
      
    47 Crampton v The Queen (supra) concerned accusations against a primary school teacher who taught at a school for students with learning difficulties. Accusations against him were first made in March 1997 and concerned conduct said to have taken place more than 20 years earlier. The majority, having quoted Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman, said that the trial judge should have drawn these considerations to the attention of the jury (at 181 para 45) (see also R v JBV [2002] NSWCCA 212, per Heydon JA (Hidden J and Blanch AJ agreeing) at para [7]). 
     
      
    48 Against this background, let me turn to the trial and the summing up. 
     
      
       
      The trial. 
       
      
    49 The trial was short. The accused was arraigned on Wednesday 16 February 2005 and the Crown opened. The trial was then adjourned to the following day (Thursday 17 February 2005) when the complainant and other Crown witnesses were called. The accused did not give evidence, nor call evidence. Counsel addressed on Friday 18 February 2005 and the trial judge began his summing up that day. The summing up was completed the following Monday before lunch. The jury returned its verdict on Tuesday 22 February 2005 at 11.12 am. 
     
      
    50 One should state the obvious lest it be overlooked. The complainant was a young woman aged 23 years when she gave evidence (in 2005). She described an incident that had occurred in 1987 when she was six years old and in kindergarten (count 1). She related events several years later in 1991, when she was about ten (counts 2 and 3). She described the circumstances giving rise to the charges in counts 4 and 5 which were said to have taken place in 1992 when she was 11 years old. Obviously the jury would have known that they were dealing with the recollections of a young child (and a very young child in the case of count 1). That impression was reinforced by counsels' addresses, where she was repeatedly described as ""a young child"". 
     
      
    51 Counsel for the Crown, trying to anticipate the address of his opponent, adverted to the issue that lies at the heart of the extended Longman warning, that is, that the accusations may have their source in childhood fantasy and distortion. The Crown said this: (T18/19) (18.2.05) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now I think at one stage during the course of her cross examination it was suggested to her that she might have dreamed about one of these events. I think my friend might have been referring to the incident that occurred at the flats, The Breakers flats. Well you might find that a little bit difficult to cop. You might find it a little bit difficult to accept that she would dream that she felt pain, dream of getting up and going to the bathroom and having a bath, you might find that a little bit difficult to accept. You may say to yourself well look, this is not a question of whether or not someone's dreamed about these things happening, it's a question of whether or not they've told you the truth."" 
        
       
      
    52 Counsel for the accused did not suggest, in terms, that the accusation in counts 4 and 5 were fantasy. Nonetheless, he did deal with the turmoil in the complainant's life after the separation of her parents. He said this: (T38/39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Sorry there's one other matter, general thing. The question of (the complainant) and her childhood it has probably occurred to you, you don't have to be a child psychologist or a counsellor it is a matter of commonsense we've all been around the block. It must have been awful. Particularly, it was clear that prior to the separation of the parents you might think everything was terrific, but what an awful situation for any young child, and I'm not being critical of either of the parents or (the complainant). It is a fact that happens all the time, and no doubt some of you have experienced it or understand how difficult it is for a young child in a large family to suddenly find themselves, their world torn apart and there's no other way of describing it, it happens and I'm not being critical of anyone, these things happen, but its awful. 
        
       
       
        
        The sort of stresses and psychological traumas and unspoken fears and terrors that children must experience when they have to go through those sorts of matters particularly when they're asked to chose. Who do you want to live with? I mean what sort of a choice is that to ask a child, and I'm not being critical of the (complainant's family) they were obviously doing the best they could. 
        
       
       
        
        But just imagine, and using your own commonsense and experience of the world, how that young girl, in fact all of that family would have felt and it is not only that, there's the continual changing of the schools and the changing of their residences. Notwithstanding the best intentions and the best efforts of (the complainant's father), and (the complainant's mother) to continue to nurture and love these children, you can imagine the stresses that those children were involved in, and that's the sort of context if you like, and you won't ignore that, that's (the complainant's) background, that's who she is. And apart from the incident at Hannam Vale that she described in 1987 which I'll come to, these other two incidents occurred in the middle of that she says, in the middle of that turmoil. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the human condition is an extraordinary thing, I mean that's trite to say that, but you might think it is absolutely unpredictable what a young girl or a young woman for that matter how she would respond to those sorts of circumstances, absolutely unpredictable. 
        
       
       
        
        This is not a robot we're dealing with, this is (not) somebody who is - we can program and we know what's going to happen from day to day, this is a young girl who is growing up, maturing in that sort of a context. 
        
       
       
        
        ... You might think that by itself would be a very good reason to examine very carefully and be very sceptical of what she says occurred during that period of her life."" 
        
       
      
    53 Counsel for the accused emphasised in his address the difficulties which delay had created for the accused in meeting the Crown case. He said, for instance, in the context of the first count, the following: (T32/33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""...  
        The real question is how on earth is an accused person to answer a charge if there's absolutely no surrounding detail he can examine. 
         All we've got from the victim is that there was some barbecue at some time during the year, sometime during the day some people were there, she went into the kitchen, there was an indecent assault and she went outside. We don't know what time of the year it was. We don't know whether it was hot or cold. We don't know who was there, and in particular my friend said we expected that I'd say - I would make the submission to you well why would he take an unacceptable risk? 
        
       
       
        
        Well the fact is we don't know whether there was a risk or not, because there is just no evidence about the circumstances surrounding that allegation, and you might think how on earth is anyone going to challenge that? What can a man do except say, 'I am not guilty'? I mean if there was some circumstance that we could perhaps examine, she mentioned that there were no neighbours, only friends, up to ten or 20 people I think her evidence was. Well you don't know who they were, or more importantly, we don't even know if the time of year that she says it happened, we were even in the district. There's just nothing at all for an accused person, and in this case this man to say, well look that's the fact she says that, I can tell you that that's not the case because I was in Darwin or she says Joe Blow was at the barbecue and he died the week before, or it was really cold, there's nothing."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    54 Counsel, when dealing with counts 4 and 5, being the counts which are the subject of this appeal, again emphasised the absence of detail. He said this: (T37) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... it is not as if (the complainant) has spent, in evidence before you a half an hour describing in detail with myriads of detail the circumstances of the event, there are very few details in the account she has given to you, you might they're extremely bland accounts, the bare minimum you might think."" 
        
       
      
    55 Counsel added: (T37/38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the vagueness and the length of time over which the incident is said to have happened between whatever it is, and I don't remember, between April and December or between June and October, or 87 or 91 and 92, you will remember, I don't know whether you've been given a copy of the indictment but you will be reminded of what the terms are, the offences are said to have happened within a period of several months, so many years ago. Now I've already mentioned to you, you might think how unfair that is and the question of the detail you'd expect to enable an accused man to focus on or attach or think about so that he can challenge these accusations, but the evidence is clear that he's an itinerant worker, at the time. He's all over Australia. And (the appellant), perhaps not surprising has got no records of where he was at various times of the year. He doesn't know precisely where he was."" 
        
       
      
    56 The address continued: (T38) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is a very bald allegation made that on a certain, unspecified night something happened, and that's it. And you might think well that's just simply unfair, how can he? I mean he's not in any position now to say well I know that on September 1 1991, I was down a (mine) shaft at Coober Pedy, that might be a different kettle of fish altogether, we've just got this very vague time span, very vague account of where people were living and very vague account of when the accused was there. And the Crown asks you to put them altogether and accept beyond a reasonable doubt that what (the complainant) said happened, happened."" 
        
       
      
    57 Counsel concluded his address, again emphasising the absence of detail and the difficulty that created for the accused in testing the evidence: (T43) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... There's no way he can really, you might think, it's a matter for you,  
        there's no way he can really test it or challenge it 
        , what can he say, I'm not guilty, he said that to you, and you heard him say that at the beginning of the trial, what more you might think can he possibly say, and I would ask you to consider that that allegation was raised by a young girl, in the condition that I've already described about this, I won't call it dysfunctional, but perhaps less than stable family environment, and you might think that the whole context is something which I could not feel comfortable about. There are just too many problems with the evidence in this case, quite apart from that it's vague for you to feel at all comfortable, let alone be persuaded beyond a reasonable (doubt) that any of these allegations had been proved, and in those circumstances it is I would submit to you that you will return verdicts of not guilty for the remaining counts that are in the indictment. I am confident you will."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      The summing up. 
       
      
    58 There are scattered references throughout the summing up to the issues of delay and the age of the applicant at the time of each incident, and the potential impact of each of these matters upon the reliability of the complainant's evidence. 
     
      
    59 His Honour began by emphasising that the complainant was a crucial witness in the trial (SU 25). His Honour said, not quite accurately, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""67. ... On the complainant's evidence, if you accept it, each of the sexual assaults occurred a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 17 and a half years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        68. The evidence is clear, if you accept it, that the complainant was six years old at the time of the first offence and possibly 11 and a half years old, I say possibly because my maths is not my strongest suit, but possibly 11 and a half years old at the time of the last, and she was more than 23 and a half years old at the time she gave her evidence. The accused challenges in cross examination the allegations, in particular the allegations that there was any form of sexual activity by him against the complainant."" 
        
       
      
    60 Count 1 alleged an assault in 1987 when the complainant was six years old. The appellant was not apprised of that allegation until September 1996, a delay of nine years. The trial (February 2005) was 18 years after the incident. 
     
      
    61 Counts 2 and 3 were said to have occurred in 1991. The appellant was informed five years later. The trial took place 14 years after the alleged incident. 
     
      
    62 Counts 4 and 5, which are the important counts in respect of this appeal, were said to have occurred in 1992. The appellant was told in September 1996, a delay of four years. The trial was 13 years after the incident. 
     
      
    63 The reference to ""a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 17 and a half years"" was presumably a reference to the interval between each incident and the date of trial. As such, it was generous to the appellant, since the delay after September 1996 had been occasioned by him. Yet, his Honour and counsel recognised, in the discussion before the trial began (supra para [28]ff), a distinction should be made between the delay in bringing the allegations to the notice of the accused and the delay in bringing the matter to trial. Hayne J, in Crampton v The Queen (supra) (para 140) said this in the context of the need for the Longman warning: (at 11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The critical feature of the circumstances I have described is that many years had elapsed between the time of the alleged conduct and the accused being put on notice of the allegation."" 
        
       
      
    64 Once an accused is apprised of the case he has to meet, he can cast his mind back to the time of the alleged offence. Only then can he begin to assemble the forensic weapons that may demonstrate that the complainant's account is untrustworthy or unreliable. Obviously, the longer the interval, the greater the prejudice. Was he there? Did he have the opportunity to commit the offence? Who else was there? Having regard to the circumstances, as he remembers them, what aspects of the complainant's account are wrong or unreliable? How can he demonstrate that inaccuracy? 
     
      
    65 If, having been told of the case he has to meet, the prosecution is further delayed before trial, that may add to the prejudice. Memories fade with time. However, where, as here, the accused is responsible for the delay by failing to appear, he can hardly complain of prejudice concerning that delay. Nonetheless, the jury must take into account the total delay, and its effect upon memory, in determining whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's accusations are both true and accurate. 
     
      
    66 In respect of counts 4 and 5, therefore, the critical delay, in terms of disadvantage to the accused, was the four years between the alleged incident in 1992 and September 1996, when the appellant was told of the complainant's allegations by the police. 
     
      
    67 Returning to the summing up, his Honour thereafter identified a number of reasons why the jury should exercise caution before accepting the complainant's evidence. The summing up was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""69. Now there are a number of matters that will cause you to have some caution, which I will speak about in more detail later, about accepting the complainant, and I want to tell you what they are. The passage of time somewhere between 12 to 17 and a half years, between the alleged offences and the trial; the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged events; the absence of immediate complaint, if you find there was such an absence, by the complainant to a person to whom she might reasonably have been expected to complain immediately; the passage of time between the alleged events and any report of the event by the complainant to the police, which I think was some six years; the presence of inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence on what the defence argue are significant matters; the difficulties the accused has in identifying the very day these offences are alleged to have occurred and the consequent difficulties that that would present to him in mounting a defence. All of those matters are warning signs you must recognise when considering the complainant's testimony."" 
        
       
      
    68 The jury was reminded that it needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's evidence was both honest and accurate (para 70). His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""72. Now it is important in understanding the warning that I am about to give you, that you understand this point. How you assess the believability of the complainant as she gave her evidence is a matter for you. But in the circumstances of this case I think it prudent to warn you that you must scrutinise the evidence of the complainant very carefully before you rely upon it to a degree where you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt."" 
        
       
      
    69 The warning continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""74. I give you the warning which I am about to give you because in the past there have been cases, not necessarily sexual assault cases, but certainly including sexual assault cases, where the evidence of the criminal acts has come from one source only and the past experience of the court is that on some occasions that evidence has subsequently been demonstrated to have been unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        75. Now evidence can be unreliable because it is a deliberate lie. It can also be unreliable because it is not accurate. You must not only be satisfied and satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is honest, but you must also be satisfied the complainant is accurate. That is why the passage of time since the event and the complainant's age at the time of the alleged acts are important factors in assessing her reliability."" 
        
       
      
    70 There followed a passage which was introduced by a reference to counsel's address. Although introduced by a reference to Mr Golding of counsel, his Honour, I believe, added the authority of the court to the direction when he explained the difficulties faced by the accused. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""76. As Mr Golding pointed out, the passage of years also inhibits the defence in accurately identifying the specific time these alleged offences are said to have occurred and mounting an answer with detailed precision in relation to the charge levelled. ..."" 
        
       
      
    71 His Honour, in this context, reminded the jury that the span of time identified in count 1 was three months, was four months in counts 2 and 3 and eight months (1 April 1992 to 31 December 1992) in counts 4 and 5. His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""77. ... So he says had the specific dates been identified, the accused - this is Mr Golding's argument - could with more certainty have been able to determine whether he had an alibi in the sense that he was not at the relevant premises but elsewhere in Australia on the nominated date. As the allegations presently are made, the accused is unable to advance any defence of that kind."" 
        
       
      
    72 The jury was warned that a dishonest or inaccurate witness can be a convincing witness, especially if the witness believed she was being honest (para 78). 
     
      
    73 His Honour thereafter reminded the jury of the evidence relied upon by the Crown as corroboration in respect of count 5 (supra paras [21] to [26]). There followed an instruction which incorporated many of the fundamentals of the Longman warning. His Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""82. You need to understand that what I have said or what I am saying is not to be taken as a direction or as an indication by me that you could not or should not convict on the complainant's evidence. All I am doing is warning you, for the reasons that I have given, that it is dangerous to convict unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and as to the accuracy of what the complainant has said in respect of the fundamental elements of each offence, or any offence, and you having scrutinised that evidence with great care and considered all of the factors relevant to its assessment including those that I have just directed you about and those in relation to delay."" 
        
       
      
    74 The appellant complains that there is no reference in that passage, nor elsewhere in the summing up, to the difficulties faced by the appellant in testing the complainant's evidence after so long a delay. I will return to that issue below. 
     
      
    75 His Honour then turned to other issues before saying this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""86. Members of the jury, I have just given you a warning that you should approach the complainant's evidence with great caution because the experience of the Court is that it would be dangerous to convict on the unsupported evidence of the complainant. ..."" 
        
       
      
    76 Having given that warning, his Honour then said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""87. That is quite a long direction that I have given you about the warning about it being dangerous to convict on the unsupported evidence of the complainant and I just want to recapitulate what I have said. 
        
       
       
        
        88. I have warned you that for a number of reasons it would be dangerous to accept the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in cases where you find there is no supporting evidence and the only case in which there could possibly be supporting evidence, and it will be a matter for you whether there is, is the last charge, the fifth count. Now you must consider the warning that I have given to you but it is open to you, having considered the warnings, for you to decide nonetheless that you are capable of being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to her accuracy and as to her honesty on the essential elements of the offence, even though it would be dangerous to do so. In other words, it is a question for you."" 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour went on to deal with the absence of a timely complaint and the effect that may have upon the complainant's ""credibility or believability"" (para 105). His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""112. Evidence was led on the second morning of evidence, which was not the subject of cross examination, that on each of the three occasions the complainant alleged she was sexually assaulted, she did not complain to anyone because she was scared that no-one would believe her and because she was ashamed because she thought it may have been her fault. In some cases a delay in complaint may have an impact upon the defence in that access to evidence may be lost or memories impaired with the passage of time. We do know that the defence was confronted with the allegations in 1996 when an administrative decision was made by the Local Court that he should stand trial. That of course was seven or eight years after the first alleged assault and four or five years after the 1992 allegations. Thereafter of course he was aware of the allegations and the material contained in the police brief. 
        
       
       
        
        113. You must consider whether in the circumstances of this case the absence of immediate complaint delayed bringing the allegations to the attention of the accused and, if so, whether he was thereby prejudiced. You will also need to consider whether the absence of immediate complaint points to an unreliability of the complainant because it either bespeaks dishonesty or inaccuracy."" 
        
       
      
    78 It will be noticed in that passage that his Honour leaves it open whether, in the delay between the incidents and the complaint, there was prejudice. That was an error, although not one specifically identified in the submissions of the appellant. Where there is significant delay, there is an irrebuttable presumption that there has been prejudice to the accused (R v BWT (supra) Wood CJ at CL at 247). Here, in respect of count 1, the delay was nine years which was significant. As it happened, the appellant was acquitted on count 1 and indeed acquitted on counts 2 and 3. The delay in drawing the allegations to the attention of the appellant in respect of counts 4 and 5 was, as mentioned, four years. The trial proceeded before his Honour upon the basis that a Longman warning was appropriate in respect of all counts (cf Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285 at 307, 329, 330). I will return to the significance of this error below. 
     
      
    79 His Honour then dealt with the elements of each charge, reminding the jury of the evidence concerning each element. His directions included a reminder of the warnings he had given in respect of the complainant's evidence (para 170) (count 3); (para 181) (count 4). 
     
      
    80 At the end of the summing up, his Honour returned to the issue of delay. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""223. There is evidence of delay. I have already referred to the evidence of delay. In respect of the first charge it could be seventeen and a half years, as much as that. In respect of the fifth charge it could be as much as twelve or thirteen years, just depending on your maths. 
        
       
       
        
        224. The evidence discloses that accused was an itinerant worker, who would spend on occasions months away from the Manning Valley region. You have heard the arguments of Mr Golding as to the difficulty the accused would have given the range of dates alleged in each of the charges in determining where he as on the occasion, that is the specific occasion that the complainant alleges he was sexually assaulting her."" 
        
       
      
    81 His Honour added the following direction which later drew protest from the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        ""225. Now I give you this direction in respect of the delay. If it is your view the accused has lost or may have lost the opportunity of relying upon a credible defence as a consequence of delay, then you must acquit the accused of the charge or charges in which you found he lost or may have lost such an opportunity."" 
        
       
      
    82 In the absence of the jury, the following exchange took place between his Honour and counsel for the Crown: (SU 99/100) 
     
      
       
        
        ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is a very strong direction -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- It is a strong direction -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: -- Particularly in light of the fact your Honour that some of the delays directly attributable to the accused's -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- Yes, I thought about that -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: -- Failure to attend. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I thought about that but so what? If at the end of the day -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: -- Well your Honour did say 17 years. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I know, 17 years. If as a consequence of the delay whosever fault it is the accused has lost a credible opportunity to mount a defence. Sorry, has lost an opportunity to mount a credible defence. Even if it's his fault he is entitled to be acquitted."" 
        
       
      
    83 The Crown added: (SU 100/101) 
     
      
       
        
        ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: The difficulty I had with it your Honour is that your Honour did give a Longman Direction. I don't complain about that at all but one of the facets of a Longman Direction is the delay that it puts in front of the accused in properly investigating and mounting a defence. Your Honour's direction that they must acquit now in my submission cuts across -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- Not they must acquit."" 
        
       
      
    84 Counsel for the accused did not object to the direction. His Honour refused, in these circumstances, to withdraw or modify the direction. 
     
      
    85 However, the appellant complains on this appeal about the direction. He seeks leave to argue that it constituted an error. Attention was drawn to the comments of Buddin J in R v GS [2003] NSWCCA 73. The trial judge in that case had told the jury that they were ""required to ask (themselves) this: has the accused GS lost a chance of obtaining a fair trial"" by reason of delay in complaint? In respect of that direction, Buddin J said this: (Santow JA and Smart AJ agreeing) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[18] ... The problem with posing that question was twofold. First, it was not the question with which the jury was ultimately concerned. The issue to which their attention should have been directed in the present context, was that as the appellant had been disadvantaged in making his defence to the charge by reason of the delay, they were accordingly and consistently with the onus of proof, to consider the matter of delay in deciding whether or not to accept the complainant's evidence. The question which was posed thus raised a false issue for the jury's consideration and as such was likely to have distracted their attention away from the real issues that they were to determine. It also raised the bar too high in the sense that a failure to have a fair trial is a more stringent test than was required. Secondly, by posing the question as a warning, it gave rise to the possibility which was heightened by the introduction of the fair trial criterion, of a response that was in the negative. If the jury did in fact arrive at the conclusion that the appellant had not lost the chance of obtaining a fair trial, or putting it another way, had had a fair trial, then they may as a result have been more readily prepared to accept the complainant's evidence and thus convict. At the very least, a negative response to the question would in all likelihood have led the jury to put to one side any further consideration of the issues concerning the delay in complaint as bearing upon the credibility of the complainant's evidence as well as the directions which they received in relation to that question."" 
        
       
      
    86 Here, in my view, the direction should not have been given. It had no basis in authority. Although it posed a question which may be relevant to the jury's consideration of delay, it did not formulate the test. Nonetheless, it was designed to be and was, I believe, a direction favourable to the accused. It offered a passage to acquittal without the need to examine the Crown case. In my opinion, answering the question in the negative would not carry the risk identified by Buddin J that the jury may the more readily accept the complainant's evidence and underrate delay. If the question were answered in the negative, the jury would then be required to examine closely the complainant's evidence and other material relied upon by the Crown. The verdicts on counts 1 and 3 suggest that they did so.  
     
      
    87 Returning to the summing up, his Honour included a brief summary of counsels' arguments. He said this, concerning the address by counsel for the accused in respect of the age of the complainant at the time of each alleged incident: 
     
      
       
        
        ""242. He said to you that the reason that the jury was selected from the community at random is because there is an enormous pool of wisdom and we all understand, he said, human nature. I think by that he meant that you would understand human nature and that you would recognise that little girls lie. He said that is called commonsense and he pointed out that you have to evaluate questions of fact as part of your everyday lives."" 
        
       
      
    88 His Honour reminded the jury of what counsel had said in respect to the sorts of issues that might be the subject of an extended Longman direction. The summing up was in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""245. He dealt with the Crown's submission on the dream and he said 'Well look there is no evidence of a dream' and as I understood he was not putting to you that the complainant had dreamt but rather what was saying to you was 'But gee whiz there's an imprecision about her evidence'. The evidence of her clothing had the hallmarks of being unclear. There was evidence of a shower and there was evidence of a bath and he said you must be left in an unclear position as to what had actually occurred in respect of that final incident and so it went on. So he said there is an imprecision as to her evidence or an inconclusiveness on some occasions as to what it all means."" 
        
       
      
    89 In the context of the first count, his Honour reminded the jury (para 246) of counsel's rhetorical question: how is the accused to answer a charge where there is no surrounding detail? He added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""246. ... He says the detail is important because what the accused does not know is who was there or what they are doing. He said 'We don't even know what time of the year it happened and whether the accused was in the district'. .... 
        
       
       
        
        249. ... the accused was away for months at a time. In respect of the last offence, on the defence argument, the accused had no opportunity to stay overnight."" 
        
       
      
    90 Still dealing with Mr Golding's submissions in address, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""254. The defence argued that there was a vagueness created by the time frames set out in the indictment, the time frames, the various months in which the alleged offence was said it would have occurred. The very fact that those time frames are so wide, Mr Golding's argument is, creates a vagueness and he said for instance if you look at the evidence of (the complainant's father) and the evidence of (the complainant's mother) as to where they say they were at various times, the evidence of where they said they were, in the time frame set out in the indictment was different, and how can he, that is, how can the defence come to answer with any specificity one particular date in the time frame, when that date is not identified with any precision."" 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour concluded his summing up by repeating aspects of the Longman warning. He instructed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""261. I remind you that in considering the complainant's evidence you must approach it with great caution and that it would be dangerous for you to convict on the complainant's evidence alone unless you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was both honest and was accurate in respect of the essential elements of each offence. 
        
       
       
        
        262. I remind you that in respect of the last offence the Crown argues but it will be a matter for you, that there are two independent supporting pieces of evidence. I remind you that the defence disputes those two independent supporting pieces of evidence."" 
        
       
      
    92 The appellant argued that the last of these directions effectively excluded count 5 from the warning. However, I am not persuaded that that is so on a fair reading of the summing up as a whole. 
     
      
       
      Should leave be given? 
       
      
    93 It is convenient to deal with the Notice of Appeal para (a) (inability to test the complainant's evidence) and para (c) (difficulties in meeting the Crown case) together, both being aspects of the Longman direction. I will then deal with para (b) (fragility of youthful recollection), being a complaint based upon the extended Longman direction. 
     
      
    94 In terms of para (c), his Honour did, I believe, adequately instruct the jury concerning the forensic difficulties which delay occasioned to the appellant in meeting the Crown case. The summing up emphasised that the appellant was an itinerant worker, often absent for long periods. His Honour reminded the jury of the spread of dates in each count and the difficulties that created, for instance, in respect of alibi. His Honour emphasised the delay in complaint. He generously incorporated, as part of the delay, the period between September 1996, when the applicant absconded, and the end of 2004, when he was again taken into custody. He characterised the delay as being variously 12 to 17 years. In the context of an itinerant worker, a jury was likely to regard delay of that magnitude as significant. 
     
      
    95 Moving then to para (a), his Honour did not say, in terms, that delay created difficulties for the appellant in testing the Crown case, including the complainant's evidence. That was an important shortcoming. Every formulation of the Longman direction suggests it is a requirement. The loss of surrounding detail with the lapse of time inevitably makes it more difficult to cross examine the complainant and meet the Crown case (R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210 at paras [141] to [143], per Kirby J). Counsel for the appellant suggested that this was a fundamental error, giving rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice, such that leave should be given. Two matters were highlighted. First, the disadvantages occasioned to the appellant were actual not simply theoretical. The complainant, when cross examined, simply could not remember many important details (for example, T20 (17.2.05)). She said, in the context of count 5, that ""somehow I was rolled over and he was on top of me"" (T12). Somehow her underpants were removed, but she could not remember how. She could not remember whether she saw the appellant that evening or the next morning. She thought the appellant was naked in bed, but acknowledged that she told the police in September 1996 that she was not sure whether he was clothed or naked. 
     
      
    96 Secondly, the matter was made worse, according to the appellant, because the jury was told, during the course of the summing up, that witnesses, including the complainant, had been ""skilfully"" questioned by counsel then appearing at the trial for the appellant (SU para 64). 
     
      
    97 The failure to state that delay had disadvantaged the accused in respect of his ability to test the evidence was an error. However, nothing was said to the trial judge by experienced counsel then appearing for the appellant. The issue arises whether counsel overlooked the matter or deliberately refrained from seeking a redirection for tactical reasons. Where there is forensic advantage in not drawing to the attention of the Court a misdirection to the jury, a miscarriage of justice is less likely. Here, there is no affidavit from counsel. The Court is left to infer whether the matter may have been overlooked or whether there were forensic reasons why counsel chose not to seek redirections on this aspect and the other error identified in para [78] above. 
     
      
    98 Here, most aspects of the Longman warning had been covered. Taking the summing up as a whole, the jury had been told of the difficulties which delay had occasioned to the appellant in meeting the Crown case. They had been warned and, indeed, repeatedly warned in strong terms that it was dangerous to convict on the evidence of the complainant alone. They had been enjoined to scrutinise her evidence with great care, bearing in mind the warning, and directing their attention not only to her truthfulness, but to the accuracy of her testimony. What was missing was a direction that delay had made it difficult to test the complainant's evidence and that such delay had caused actual prejudice, rather than possible prejudice. 
     
      
    99 It is instructive to ask what was likely to have happened had counsel asked for a redirection that corrected each of these shortcomings. Any redirection, in fairness to the Crown, would need to make the distinction between disadvantage arising from delay in making the complaint and delay occasioned by the appellant absconding between September 1996 and late 2004. The distinction had been recognised at the outset of the trial, but overlooked during the summing up. 
     
      
    100 As matters stood, counsel for the accused, in his address, had repeatedly drawn attention to the absence of detail in the complainant's evidence and the difficulties that created for the appellant. His Honour had reminded the jury at some length of these arguments. A reminder of counsel's arguments is obviously not the same as a direction from the judge in the summing up. It lacks the authority of the Court. Counsel, nonetheless, would have been obliged to consider the marginal advantage of a redirection compared to any potential disadvantage, were that redirection given. The potential disadvantage involved cutting down the generous description of delay (12 to 17 and a half years) in circumstances where the jury knew that the appellant was an itinerant worker. Any redirection would need to differentiate between the different counts. There was a significant interval between the alleged incident in count 1 and the complaint (nine years). Counts 4 and 5, on the other hand, involved a delay of only four years before the appellant became aware of the allegations. More than that, counts 4 and 5 were effectively the same transaction. When ultimately sentencing the appellant, his Honour regarded count 4 (digital penetration) as ""foreplay"" before count 5 (penile penetration). Count 5 was supported by other evidence. It was the most serious offence. 
     
      
    101 Here, I infer that counsel, for sound forensic reasons, chose not to raise the issue (cf R v JBV [2002] NSWCCA 212, per Heydon JA (Hidden J and Blanch AJ agreeing) at para [15]). 
     
      
    102 Nor am I otherwise persuaded that, in the context of counts 4 and 5, which resulted in convictions, that there was a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave in respect of the Notice of Appeal para 1(a) and 1(c). 
     
      
    103 Moving to para (b) (the fragility of childhood recollection) Longman, it will be remembered, concerned allegations of indecent assault made more than 20 years after the assaults were said to have occurred. They were allegations dependant upon the uncorroborated recollection of a child then aged six years, who had been woken from her sleep. 
     
      
    104 Here, the circumstances giving rise to counts 4 and 5 involved a young child, about 11 years old, being woken from her sleep. That said, the circumstances were very different. First, she was significantly older than the child in Longman being 11 years. Secondly, the matter had been drawn to the attention of the police and the appellant four years later. Thirdly, counts 4 and 5 were not allegations of indecent assault. The allegation involved conduct which was far more brutal. Count 4 was an assertion of digital penetration and count 5 of penile penetration of a young girl. Finally, the circumstances as described by the complainant do not suggest fantasy. She described a particular sequence which could hardly have had its source in a dream. The complainant said that, after intercourse, she noticed bleeding from the vagina. She then had a bath late at night. She thought she left the bath water in the bath. Her father gave evidence of seeing water in the bath with blood the next morning. More than that, the complainant was upset and wished to see her mother. Apart from that evidence, there was the evidence of the alleged admission by the appellant to Mr Durant, that he had ""fucked"" the complainant. In conducting the case, the appellant did not suggest fantasy or distortion. It was put simply that the incident did not occur. 
     
      
    105 His Honour, on this aspect, dealt with the case as it had been run. There was no application for an extended Longman warning. I am not persuaded that there was a miscarriage of justice in respect of para (c). I would likewise refuse leave under Rule 4 in respect of that matter. 
     
      
      Order. 
       
      
    106 Accordingly, the order I propose is that leave under Rule 4 should be refused and the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    107 HOWIE J: I agree with Kirby J.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 JAMES, J: I agree with Hall, J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON, J: I agree with Hall, J. 
     
      
    3 HALL, J: On 6 October 2005, the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 appealed the sentences pronounced by the District Court of New South Wales, Sydney District, with respect to the respondent on 9 September 2005. 
     
      
    4 The respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely, a commercial quantity of ecstasy, the offence having been committed on 26 October 2004. 
     
      
    5 The charge pursuant to s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) carried a maximum penalty for the offence of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units ($385,000). 
     
      
    6 The history of the proceedings is set out in the Crown’s written submissions which are reproduced below. 
     
      
    7 The respondent was committed for sentence to the District Court on 18 May 2005 from the Burwood Local Court. 
     
      
    8 On 3 June 2005, the respondent’s matter was mentioned before the Chief Judge, and the matter was fixed for sentence on 22 July 2005. 
     
      
    9 On 22 July 2005, evidence was given in closed court of assistance given by the respondent to police (an affidavit of assistance was tendered and marked as Exhibit SC). The respondent also gave evidence and submissions were made by the Crown and the defence and the matter was then stood over to 26 August 2005. 
     
      
    10 On 26 August 2005, the sentencing judge adjourned the sentencing hearing to 9 September 2005. 
     
      
    11 On 9 September 2005, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 18 months. However, the sentence was suspended pursuant to s.12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) conditionally upon the respondent entering into a bond on the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “• To appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 
        
       
       
        
        • to be of good behaviour; 
        
       
       
        
        • to reside at a specified address and to advise the Clerk of the Court by pre-paid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond; 
        
       
       
        
        •  
        to be subject to the direction and supervision of the Probation & Parole Service during the term of the bond; and 
        
       
       
        
        •  
        to report to the Officer-in-Charge of the Burwood Office of the Probation & Parole Service within three days.” 
        
       
      
    12 The respondent had been arrested on the date of the offence, 26 October 2004, and was held in custody for approximately four months before he was released to bail on 7 March 2005.  
     
      
       
      Statement of facts 
       
      
    13 The statement of facts as found by the sentencing judge in respect of the respondent are set out in the Crown’s written submissions and are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) A taskforce in 2004 focused on drug supply, of which the respondent was not a target. 
       
       
      (b) On 26 October 2004, the respondent was parked in a motor vehicle at the McDonald’s Restaurant, Enfield carpark. 
       
       
      (c) The targets of police were the co-offenders Smith and He who were also parked in a motor vehicle at the McDonald’s Restaurant. 
       
       
      (d) The respondent approached Smith’s parked car, leaned into the car and carried back a plastic bag to his own vehicle. 
       
       
      (e) The respondent was seated with his girlfriend in his own vehicle. 
       
       
      (f) As police approached the car, the girl dropped the bag onto the ground. 
       
       
      (g) Police saw the respondent try to kick the bag underneath the car. 
       
       
      (h) The bag was recovered and contained five bundles of pink tablets that totalled 500 tablets (later analysed and found to contain ecstasy). 
       
       
      (i) The respondent was then arrested. 
       
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    14 There is only one ground of appeal in the notice of appeal, namely, that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    15 It has been submitted on behalf of the Crown that the objective seriousness of the offence was so great that the sentence handed down did not reflect that objective seriousness. 
     
      
    16 The Crown pointed to the fact that the offence carries a penalty of 20 years, the amount involved being not less than the commercial quantity, which is 0.125 kilograms, and the amount involved being 160 grams.  
     
      
    17 Whilst the Crown has observed that this Court has on occasions treated the drug, the subject of the charges in this appeal, as a mid-range drug (see Regina v. Bimahendali [1999] NSWCCA 409 at [14]), reliance was placed upon the observations of Wood CJ. at CL. in that case at [17]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately, the best guide is that given by the legislature as to the available penalty, dependent upon whether the drug in question is more or less than the traffickable or commercial quantity prescribed …” 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown also referred to observations in Regina v. Peel (1971) 1 NSWLR 247 at 252 wherein it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In determining the proper penalty … the fundamental consideration is rather the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the Act in question, the respondent’s conduct would offend against the legislative objective of suppressing the illicit traffic in the prohibited drug.” 
          
        
       
      
    19 Similarly, in Regina v. Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430, Howie, J., with whom Studdert, and Whealy, JJ. agreed, stated:- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “… this Court no longer approaches the evaluation of the seriousness of a particular supply offence by distinguishing between different types of drugs according to the perceived dangerousness of the drug being supplied. Rather, the Court has stressed that the appropriate consideration is the relevant statutory regime and the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence:  
          Regina v. Nai Poon 
           (2003) 56 NSWLR 284;  
          Regina v. Neale 
           (2004) 138 A. Crim. R. 493.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    20 The Crown also referred to Regina v. Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398 at [37]. The Crown submitted that the seriousness of the respondent’s offending, must not only be judged by the statutory criteria, but also by the other purposes which sentencing is intended to serve referring specifically to the provisions of s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    21 The Crown contended that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The elements of both specific and general deterrence; 
       
       
      (b) The legislative intention in relation to these types of offences; and 
       
       
      (c) The protection of the community. 
       
      
    22 It also contended that the sentencing judge gave undue weight to the respondent’s subjective features. The ultimate submission is that the sentencing judge erred in giving the respondent a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of 18 months and then suspending the whole sentence. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    23 In the remarks on sentence made on 9 September 2005, the sentencing judge referred specifically to the following:- 
     
      
       
      • The confidential affidavit evidence relevant to assistance provided by the respondent to police. 
       
       
      • Evidence and the Crown’s concession that in fact the assistance given by the respondent was more than indicated in Exhibit SC. 
       
       
       • Satisfaction on the evidence that it was the respondent’s intention to assist police to the best of his ability and that he made numerous and conscientious efforts to do so. 
       
       
      • The fact that the provisions of s.23(2)(c) were satisfied ( 
      “the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender …” 
      ). 
       
      • In terms of s.23(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the respondent had made an extensive effort (“… the nature and extent of the defendant’s assistance or promised assistance”).• That, if the sentence were to be operative in its terms, then the matter set out in s.23(2)(g) of that Act (“whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of, the assistance or undertaking to assist …”) would be, according to the sentencing judge, “a reality”.• The fact that, in terms of s.23(2)(j), it was extremely unlikely that the respondent would commit further offences after release. 
      
    24 The sentencing judge, in addition to the matter of assistance, also referred to sentences imposed on the respondent’s co-offenders in the following terms (at p.3):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I have had the opportunity, this matter having been adjourned, of seeing this case in context of the cases against the two other offenders, Smith and He. Smith has been sentenced and I bear in mind the need for such consistency as is possible.” 
        
       
      
    25 In terms of relevant aggravating factors under s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the sentencing judge identified one such factor, being that the offence was organised “although at a very low level from his position” and then went on to acknowledge the seriousness of the offence in saying (at p.4):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the offence is itself by definition a serious offence. It attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and where there is a matter where there has been a trial or a conviction by a jury, the indicative non-parole period of 10 years will apply. However, there is in this case a plea of guilty which, of course, is a mitigating factor. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence is one which, on its face, deserves a sentence of full-time imprisonment. Many young people in the community have the false idea that taking ecstasy tablets and similar sorts of illicit tablets will go unpunished – that is not the case.” 
        
       
      
    26 The sentencing judge then made a series of factual findings as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The respondent had already spent four  
      “very uncomfortable” 
       months in prison which he described in evidence as  
      “terrible” 
      . 
       
       
      (b) He had been subjected to death threats (as to this, see below). 
       
       
      (c) If he returned to prison he would be at serious risk and would require to be in protective custody. 
       
       
      (d) He was a person of good character. 
       
       
      (e) He was unlikely to re-offend. 
       
       
      (f) He had shown remorse for the offence. 
       
       
      (g) He had good prospects of rehabilitation.  
       
       
      (i) He was old enough to know better. 
       
       
      (j) He did not have the mitigation of youth in his favour. 
       
       
      (k) He was not a principal target of police attention. 
       
      
    27 In relation to evidence on the question of reprisals, I consider that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence indicates that the people to be investigated were potentially dangerous but the evidence did not go any further than that. It also established that by reason thereof the respondent had legitimate fears. 
       
       
      (b) The respondent’s evidence as to his apprehension or fears was not shown to be based upon a clear direct threat to him but on certain information indirectly conveyed to him. 
       
      
    28 The sentencing judge then stated (at pp.4 to 5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… those considerations of mitigation which I have referred to operate in this case. But for the assistance that he offered the police, the sentence would have been significantly harsher. 
        
       
       
        
        In the circumstances, it seems to me that it is appropriate, noting the assistance and noting the term already spent in prison, for me to sentence this man to a term of imprisonment of two years but to suspend it. Accordingly, I sentence as follows: the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years. I set a non-parole period of 18 months. Under s.12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I order that execution of the sentence be suspended.” 
        
       
      
    29 At the conclusion of his sentencing remarks, when asked, the sentencing judge indicated that he had applied a 50% discount for the plea of guilty and assistance (indicating that he otherwise would have imposed a sentence of four years). 
     
      
    30 The Crown has correctly emphasised that the subjective features of a particular offender must not be allowed to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offence under consideration: Regina v. Dodd (1991) 57 A. Crim. R. 349 at 354; Regina v. Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594; Regina v. Myers (NSWCCA, unreported 13 February 1990). 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that in dealing with the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, not only is a full time custodial sentence required, but that a substantial full time custodial sentence should be imposed. The submission referred to the need for the courts, given the evils of the drug trade, to take a very firm stand against it, citing Regina v. Collins [2000] NSWCCA 236 at [15]; Regina v. O’Brien & Mammone (NSWCCA, unreported 23 August 1989); Regina v. Wong & Ng (1988) 39 A. Crim. R. 1 at 3. 
     
      
    32 Finally, in relation to the order suspending the sentence imposed, the Crown submitted as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “31. The Crown further submits that a suspended sentence like a sentence of periodic detention, contains a strong element of leniency, and is outwardly less severe in denunciation of criminality and is not normally appropriate in cases involving the supply of illegal drugs:  
        Regina v. Day 
         (1998) 100 A. Crim. R. 275;  
        Regina v. Niga 
         (NSWCCA, unreported 13 April 1984);  
        Regina v. Hallacoglu 
         (1992) 63 A. Crim. R. 287 at 294 and, in particular, it is not appropriate in a case involving the supply of not less than the commercial quantity. 
        
       
       
        
        32. With respect to the 50% discount, the Crown accepts that there is no fixed tariff for the discount to be applied for assistance to the authorities: see  
        Cartwright 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, 255G;  
        Regina v. Gallagher 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 220;  
        Chu 
         (NSWCCA, unreported 16 October 1998 at 6). In  
        Chu 
        , Spigelman, CJ. said at 6:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
            
          ‘On some occasions the 50% discount which was allowed in  
          Cartwright 
           itself has been treated as if it was a tariff … However it should not be so regarded. The discount is over a significant range, varying with the particular circumstances of the case and the assistance actually provided.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        33. The Crown submits, however, that the discount to be applied for the guilty plea and assistance is required to take into account the principle of proportionality in sentencing. The discounted sentence for assistance to the authorities should not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: s.23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.” 
        
       
      
    33 It was submitted that, where the maximum penalty is 20 years and where the standard non-parole period is 10 years and the sentencing judge uses four years as a starting point and then discounts it by 50% for the plea and assistance and then imposes a suspended sentence, the sentencing judge has demonstrably fallen into error. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    34 In the written submissions on behalf of the respondent, the well-known principles in relation to Crown appeals summarised by Wood, CJ. at CL. in Regina v. Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] are set out. 
     
      
    35 The respondent also relied upon observations of Spigelman, CJ. in Regina v. Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] and [19] in which the Chief Justice emphasised that questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the sentencing judge and that the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined. The respondent also relied upon the Chief Justice’s observations in that case that Crown appeals should be rare, particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on the assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred. 
     
      
    36 It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that the sentencing judge had regard to particular matters including:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence of an investigating police officer who confirmed that the respondent was not a target of their investigation and had willingly provided information and actively assisted the police investigation. 
       
       
      (b) That police held legitimate fears for the safety of the respondent. 
       
       
      (c) The affidavit of assistance (Exhibit SC) which disclosed the nature and extent of the assistance and the many occasions on which the respondent met with investigating police. 
       
       
      (d) The respondent’s prior good character. 
       
       
      (e) The evidence of Reverend Thomas Oakley as to remorse. 
       
       
      (f) The respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
       
      (g) The respondent’s plea of guilty. 
       
      
    37 In addition to the above factors, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the offence was an isolated event and that the sentencing judge found that it was organised although at a low level of organisation on the part of the respondent who, the sentencing judge also observed, was a person of prior good character and was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    38 The submissions for the respondent also emphasised that, given the evidence as to death threats referred to above, the safety of the respondent in prison was a matter that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account in determining what the sentence should be and whether it should be suspended. Reliance was placed upon observations made by the High Court in York v. The Queen [2005] 79 ALJR 1919, although in oral submissions counsel for the respondent conceded that the facts of the present case were not of the extreme nature as existed in York.  
     
      
    39 It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that it was common sentencing practice to extend leniency, sometimes substantial leniency, to an offender who had assisted the authorities and, in doing so, to take into account any threat to the offender’s safety, the conditions under which the offender would have to serve a sentence in order to reduce the risk of reprisals and the steps that would be needed to be taken to protect the offender when released. Reliance was placed upon the principles as discussed in Regina v. Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and Regina v. Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. See now Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s.23(2)(g) and (h) 
     
      
       
      Assistance to the authorities 
       
      
    40 On the hearing of the appeal, the Crown’s written submissions dated 9 September 2005 before the sentencing judge were tendered and marked as Exhibit A in these proceedings. At p.8 of the transcript of 9 September 2005, the Crown indicated that it accepted “there was quite substantial assistance given”. On this appeal, however, the Crown submitted that there was no indication in the transcript that the Crown’s representative had seen the affidavit. The Crown’s abovementioned concession had apparently come after an earlier indication that the assistance was of a limited kind. Accordingly, there was a shifting of ground by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    41 In the oral submissions on behalf of the Crown in this appeal, it was submitted that a reading of the confidential affidavit establishes that the assistance was in fact of a limited kind. The Crown further submitted that there were no “exceptional circumstances” in the case which would have justified the suspended sentence. The Crown submitted that the starting point of four years was itself manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    42 The transcript of the evidence taken in closed court on 22 July 2005 confirms that, although the respondent was willing to assist police, the fact that he failed in tasks set for him, was not attributable to a lack of willingness on his part, but was due to other circumstances. 
     
      
    43 In oral submissions on behalf of the respondent, it was submitted that the assistance given by the respondent was, in fact, substantial and reliance was placed upon the concession in this respect made by the Crown at the sentencing hearing following evidence given by the investigating police officer. 
     
      
    44 Although the Crown ultimately conceded at the sentencing hearing that the assistance given was substantial, in fact, the police evidence was to the effect that the assistance was only of limited use. Furthermore, whilst in Cartwright (supra) Hunt and Badgery-Parker, JJ. stated that the reward for providing assistance should be granted if the offender has genuinely co-operated with the authorities whether or not the information supplied objectively turns out, in fact, to have been effective. The law has changed since that decision was given. Their Honours in that case (at p.253) stated that the information given by an offender must be such as could significantly assist the authorities, emphasising that the information must, of course, be true. What was relevant was the potential of the information to assist the authorities as comprehended by the offender himself. 
     
      
    45 The law as stated in Cartwright (supra) has been Affected by s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Whilst s.23(2)(b) requires the Court to have regard to the “significance and usefulness” of the assistance given or offered, it is not the case that simply because the assistance is of no value to the authorities that it must be disregarded: Regina v. Tooth [2001] NSWCCA 407 per Howie, J. at [20] (Grove, J. agreeing) citing Regina v. Yenice (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 234 at 239, Regina v. Ward (NSWCCA, unreported 29 May 1995). 
     
      
    46 However, the provisions of s.23(2)(b) require that in deciding whether to impose a lesser sentence for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, a court must consider, inter alia, the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered; see also s.23(2)(c), (d) and (e). 
     
      
    47 Counsel for the respondent indicated on this matter that the limited use to which the respondent’s assistance was put was “… brought about by circumstances which were out of the control of this respondent, notwithstanding his endeavours …” (p.10) and emphasising the extent of his co-operation with the authorities. 
     
      
    48 In relation to the respondent’s criminality, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The case was distinguishable on its facts from  
      Harmouche 
       (supra). 
       
       
      (b) The respondent’s involvement  
      “was nothing more than a repository for the drugs, and then delivered immediately to this person Eric” 
       (transcript, p.11). 
       
       
      (c) The offence was, to an extent, opportunistic in nature and from his point of view it was not a profit-making venture. 
       
       
      (d) The evidence indicated that the respondent previously had had an  
      “unblemished lifestyle based on scholastic achievement” 
      , he having tertiary qualifications. 
       
       
      (e) It was his girlfriend who introduced him to the nightclub scene and it was through that social setting that he compromised his own standard of acceptable behaviour and commenced experimenting with the drug ecstasy and did so in order to maintain social acceptability with the people with whom he was then associating. 
       
      
    49 The respondent also relied upon the evidence of Reverend Oakley which indicated that the respondent was now an active practising Christian who attended church on a regular basis and maintained contact with those holding religious beliefs as well as changing his social network. 
     
      
    50 Finally, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that whilst the facts were not as extreme as those in York (supra), it was open to the sentencing judge to have regard to the evidence of possible reprisals in the exercise of his discretion. In this respect, however, I consider that the evidence as to reprisals was of the limited nature I have discussed earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Assistance provided to law enforcement authorities - relevant principles 
       
      
    51 In Braithwaite v. Regina [2005] NSWCCA 451 (in which the applicant had been charged under s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985), Hodgson, JA., with whom McClellan, CJ. at CL. and I agreed, stated, at [29], in relation to the question as to whether the sentences in that case should be suspended under s.12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Although, as I have said, I do not accept that the sentences cannot be suspended unless the offences fall towards the lower end of the scale or unless there are exceptional circumstances, I do consider that, in cases such as this of supply of drugs, a strong case needs to be made out to justify suspending the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    52 Hodgson, JA. concluded, on the facts of that case, (the first charge related to the supply of methylamphetamine with a mixed powder involving a total weight of 20.89 grams, and a second charge involved MDMA or ecstasy, involving a total weight of 17.78 grams, the indictable quantity being 1.25 grams), that, taking into account all circumstances, it was not appropriate to suspend the sentences for what were termed “serious drug offences”. 
     
      
    53 The salutary nature of a suspended sentence, was, however, recognised by Howie, J. (with whom Hodgson, JA. and Levine, J. agreed) in his review of the sentencing options under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in Regina v. Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at 22. In that case at [31] his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended … That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order, even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive.” 
        
       
      
    54 In this appeal, the focus of criticism was not upon the 50% discount allowed for the early plea and assistance. The focus was on whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate in failing to give due consideration to the seriousness of the offence and upon the fact that the sentence imposed was suspended: see Regina v. JCE (2000) 120 A. Crim. R. 18 at [25] and Regina v. Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [36] 
     
      
    55 In evaluating these issues, the Court must, of course, recognise the limitations upon it arising from the principles that govern the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence and the exercise of the discretion vested in this Court. In particular, as observed by Howie, J. in Zamagias (supra) at [20], the Court must have regard to the width of the discretionary judgment of the sentencing court and the limitations upon the power to review that judgment. As his Honour emphasised, the Court can interfere only if it is necessary to correct error and then only in an appropriate case, bearing in mind that a Crown appeal should be rarely successful where no particular error can be identified. 
     
      
    56 The determination of the term of imprisonment to be imposed was one to be made without regard to whether the sentence would be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served: Zamagias at [26]. In determining the availability of an alternative to full time custody, the court exercises a discretion but the discretion must be exercised according to established sentencing principles: Zamagias at [29]. 
     
      
    57 In determining whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate by reason of the order suspending it, the relevant principles, as I understand them, include the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The statutory power to suspend the operation of a sentence of imprisonment in provisions such as s.12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       confers a discretion expressed in very wide language. 
       
       
      (b) In determining what is an appropriate case to afford suspended imprisonment as an option raises the question as to what factors will determine whether such an option is legally and factually justified. 
       
       
      (c) The power to suspend under a provision such as s.12 is not confined by reference wholly, mainly or specially to the effect the suspension would have on the rehabilitation of the particular offender:  
      Dinsdale v. The Queen 
       (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 330, paragraph [26], per Gaudron and Gummow, JJ., agreeing with Kirby, J. at pp.344-346, paragraphs [74] to [89]. 
       
       
      (d) In determining whether a sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served (as a separate step to the antecedent question of the term of the sentence), the court is not confined to the circumstances that are personal to the offender but it may look again at all the matters relevant to the circumstances of the offence:  
      Dinsdale 
       (supra) per Kirby, J. at 348, paragraph [85] (in relation to a similar statutory scheme under the  
      Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) 
      ) 
      . 
       
       
      (e) Accordingly, circumstances such as the nature of the particular offence, the low likelihood of the respondent’s re-offending, and the impact which a prison sentence immediately served would have on the respondent are amongst considerations that may be considered to be available and proper to the decision of whether or not to suspend a term of imprisonment:  
      Dinsdale 
       (supra) per Kirby, J. at 349, paragraph [88]; see also Gleeson, CJ. and Hayne, J. at 329, paragraph [18], in which such factors which were taken into account by the trial judge in that case were there said to be  
      “relevant matters” 
      . 
       
       
      (f) In the exercise of the sentencing discretion to suspend a sentence, it is not necessary that the offence in question falls towards the lower end of the scale or for there to be exceptional circumstances. 
       
       
      (g) Where, however, as in this case, the offence involves the supply of prohibited drugs, the evidence needs to establish a strong case on the particular facts in order to justify an order suspending the sentence. 
       
       
      (h) Wherever the execution of a sentence is to be immediately suspended, the sentence may on that account be considered a lenient one. 
       
       
      (i) Each case is to be determined on its own facts, having particular regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender:  
      Zamagias 
       (supra) at [32]. 
       
      (j) In a particular case, the community may be appropriately protected where the sentence is designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender.(k) In determining whether a suspended sentence is an adequate form of punishment and is one which sufficiently reflects specific and general deterrence, it is necessary to have regard to the sentencing judge’s reasons for suspending the sentence and, in particular, whether the reasons given were sufficient to activate the sentencing discretion in that respect. 
      
    58 The sentencing judge dealt with the question of assistance at p.2 of the remarks on sentence and there had regard to the provisions of s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Whilst specific emphasis was given to certain provisions of s.23(2), there was no reference in particular to s.23(2)(b) (the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authorities). However, it is clear that the sentencing judge gave consideration to matters which were relevant thereto. Appropriate regard was also given to both the police evidence and to the evidence of Reverend Thomas Oakley. At p.4 of the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge stated he was satisfied that the respondent had been the subject of death threats and that if he went back to prison “… he will be at serious risk and will be required to be in custody in close protection …” (p.4). 
     
      
    59 Whilst the remarks on sentence do not, in terms, explicitly identify all of the particular reasons for the decision to suspend the sentence, one may discern from them that it was the assistance provided to the authorities and the time spent in custody which were the influencing factors (at p.5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the circumstances, it seems to me that it is appropriate, noting the assistance and noting the term already spent in prison, for me to sentence this man to a term of imprisonment of two years but to suspend it … 
        ” 
        
       
      
    60 The “circumstances” referred to here I consider is sufficient to indicate that the sentencing judge also had in mind the matters referred to by him in the immediately preceding paragraph at the foot of p.4 of the remarks on sentence, namely:- 
     
      
       
      • the respondent’s prior good character; 
       
       
      • the unlikelihood of him re-offending; 
       
       
      • the respondent’s remorse and good prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
      
    61 Although the sentencing judge had a very broad discretion as to sentencing alternatives and there was evidence of a number of factors that could provide a factual justification for an order suspending the sentence imposed, I, nonetheless, consider that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, the term of the sentence was manifestly inadequate and more so by reason of the fact that the sentence was suspended. 
     
      
    62 However, the Court has a discretion as to whether, notwithstanding that conclusion, it ought to intervene. The respondent was released from custody on 8 March 2005. If this Court were to re-sentence him so that he was required to serve a term of imprisonment, he would, by reason of matters referred to above, be required to serve it in protective custody. I note that the respondent was in custody from the date of his arrest (26 October 2004) to 8 March 2005 (134 days), or approximately four and a half months in custody. By reason of the considerable hardship that would result from the respondent being returned to custody (and the type of custody that would apply to him), I am of the view that the Court should exercise the discretion vested in it under s.5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 not to intervene. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, I would propose that the Crown’s appeal be dismissed.

      2005/1094 - REGINA v Faheem Khalid LODHI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT - Application on behalf of the accused to exclude “Brigitte” evidence 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On Thursday 20 April 2006 Mr Boulten SC made an application that certain categories of evidence not be admitted at the trial. The essential nature of the application was that the evidence was not relevant within meaning the s 55 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. Secondly, Mr Boulten argued that, even if the evidence were relevant and otherwise admissible, it should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    2 On 21 April 2006 I gave a ruling in the matter. I held that the evidence outlined by Mr Boulten was, in my view, relevant in the proceedings in that it was evidence, if it were accepted, that could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. Secondly, I held that I would not exclude the evidence because I was satisfied that its probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. These are my reasons for the decision I gave on that day. 
     
      
       
       
      The “Brigitte” evidence 
       
      
    3 The categories of evidence identified by Mr Boulten may be briefly summarised as follows:  
     
      
       
      (i) The evidence of the witness Kwon who identified Salahudin, a person who trained with him in an LeT camp, as being the same man shown in the photograph of Willie Brigitte. 
       
      (ii) The evidence of Altaf and Ahmad that they met a man at the flat premises at Boorea Avenue Lakemba who described himself as an architect from Sialkot.(iii) The evidence of the search of Brigitte’s premises and evidence as to the items found there pursuant to the Search Warrant.(iv) Evidence that a phone in the name of Brigitte was used to contact the telephone service utilised by the accused in May 2003 and the relevant telecommunication records. 
      
    4 Against the context of the submissions made on behalf of the accused, the Crown provided some further detail of documents that would be produced arising from the search of Brigitte’s premises. They were - 
     
      
    · A small “guarantee card” apparently stamped by a Paris retail outlet, with the “Sam Praveen” mobile telephone number (obtained by the accused on 6 May 2003) handwritten as “0061 4042 33 906”, suggesting that it had been recorded prior to Brigitte’s arrival in Australia. 
     
      
    · Map of Australia issued by the Anti-Nuclear Movement (Exhibit “B” on the present application) 
     
      
    · A publication called “L’Art de Guerre” 
     
      
    · A notebook containing handwritten extracts from “The Art of War” 
     
      
    · An empty magazine for a military Styer Rifle 
     
      
    · A DVD or CD containing images of a substantial number of pages from magazines in the French language, with photographs, suggesting they are articles concerning military weapons and other items to do with military assault action. 
     
      
    · Magazines on military and intelligence issues; and articles on the Australian SAS in Afghanistan (all contained on the DVD or CD) 
     
      
    · Other material contained on CD or DVD but not as yet fully itemised. 
     
      
    5 For completeness, I should add that in the Crown case statement (Exhibit “A”) on this application, the Crown had stated (para 22) that the Crown case is that, together with the circumstantial evidence as a whole, the material outlined above evidenced the purpose in Brigitte’s visit to Australia as going well beyond that legitimately held by a person holding a tourist visa. The Crown will say that the evidence points rather to Brigitte’s purpose in Australia as one connected generally with the preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act. 
     
      
       
      Submissions by counsel 
       
      
    6 In relation to the relevance argument, Mr Boulten stressed that none of the material identified above as relevant to Brigitte will be tendered by the Crown to show that the accused and Brigitte were participating in relation to the implementation of the precise charges in the indictment. In other words, it is not suggested by the Crown that it can demonstrate by any of the above evidence that Willie Brigitte was a participant in the making of, collection of or possession of documents as referred to in three of the four counts. Nor is it suggested that there will be evidence to show that he directly participated in the preparation for the terrorist act involved in the remaining count. 
     
      
    7 Mr Boulten argued that all that is shown, at its highest, by the material the subject of the present application is that there may have been some type of association or relationship between the accused and Brigitte. In addition, an examination of the temporal sequence involved in the four charges against the accused show that Willie Brigitte was detained by Immigration authorities on 9 October 2003 whereas three of the four charges related to alleged situations involving the accused after that date. 
     
      
    8 Mr Boulten submitted that there was no independent evidence from which one could draw the inference that the accused and Willie Brigitte were acting together in concert in relation to the matters involved in the four charges (Ahearn v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 86 at 93, 95 and 99). 
     
      
    9 The Crown accepted the validity of the principles in Ahearn’s case and pointed to a similar distinction appearing in Masters, Richards and Wunderlich (1992) 59 A Crim R 445 at 454. The Crown, however, argued that the evidence the subject of the present application is circumstantial evidence which, if admitted, goes to colour or complete the mosaic of the Crown case. In particular, it provides a context against which the actions of the accused may properly be assessed by the jury.  
     
      
    10 The Crown does not argue that the evidence is designed to show, or capable of showing, that Brigitte was involved in the specific acts by the accused which relate to each of the counts in the indictment. Rather, the Crown case will be, (as appears from Exhibit “A”) that the accused had a covert and illicit relationship with Willie Brigitte, a trained terrorist, who came to Australia in circumstances that tend to demonstrate he was here in connection with the establishment of preparatory steps towards terrorist acts being committed in Australia. The purpose of the evidence is to complete a circumstantial picture which will enable the jury to draw inferences as to the accused’s knowledge and intention in relation to the offences charged. In that sense, the evidence goes directly to a fact in issue namely the fault elements in each of the charges. 
     
      
    11 In support of its submissions the Crown carefully took the Court through a considerable amount of the detail that will alleged to arise in the trial about Willie Brigitte. First there is the aspect of his training with LeT in Pakistan, if the evidence of Kwon be accepted. Secondly, there is the fact that the accused himself spent a considerable time in Pakistan in 2001, 2002 and again in the early part of 2003. Thirdly, there is the mutual Pakistan connection evidenced by calls made on Brigitte’s telephone service to a Pakistan number and the fact that much later, after the arrest of Willie Brigitte, there was a contact between the accused and the mutual Pakistani number on 26 October 2003. The evidence related to this last matter will arise from telephone records and personal surveillance of the accused. 
     
      
    12 Fourthly, there will be a deal of evidence to show that the accused arranged for a telephone service to be issued in a false name, namely, “Sam Praveen”. Particulars found in his possession or at his unit on 26 October 2003 provide precise evidence that corresponds with the false telephone number that was arranged on 6 May 2003. Fifthly, there was a connection between Brigitte’s telephone number in France on 7 May and the Pakistani number. This was followed, about one and a half hours later, by a contact between Willie Brigitte’s number and the “Sam Praveen” number. 
     
      
    13 There was further contact between the Brigitte French number and the “Sam Praveen” number on 13 May 2003, that is the day before Mr Brigitte would have left France to travel to Australia. There was another call on the morning of 14 May. 
     
      
    14 Sixthly, Willie Brigitte arrived in Australia on 16 May 2003, giving, as the purpose of his visit a holiday and saying that his usual place of residence was France and that he had come on an Air New Zealand from Auckland. Among documents found in the possession of the accused there was an entry in a notebook which read “16th Friday 8.30am NZ”. There then appears to be a flight number and an entry “blue hat – yellow T-shirt. Glasses.” (The Crown says that it is to be inferred from all this that the accused was expecting the arrival of Brigitte on 16 May 2003 and that they had had contact in anticipation of his arrival. The “Sam Praveen” service was obtained primarily to permit covert contact between the accused and Brigitte, although it may have been used for other purposes). 
     
      
    15 Seventhly, the first offence with which the accused is charged occurred on 3 October 2003. This was the obtaining of maps from the electricity supply system using a false name. The next of the acts charged involved the obtaining of the details of chemicals and this occurred on 10 October 2003, the day after Brigitte was arrested. Eighthly, during Brigitte’s time in Australia there were a number of calls made by a mobile service associated with Brigitte to the service associated with the accused. The service associated with Brigitte was again one that had been obtained in a false name through Vodafone. It was first activated on 31 May 2003 by a mobile service using an SIM card, which was later found in the possession Abdul Rakib Hasan, the butcher from Lakemba. That card, it would seem, was later removed from the telephone, from the handset, and replaced with another that was found in the possession of Brigitte or in his unit at or shortly after arrest. This mobile phone service was taken out in the false name of “John Huck”. There were calls made by the John Huck service on 1 June to the “Sam Praveen” service and there were, in addition, 27 calls made between 31 May and 9 October 2003 between the “John Huck” service and the butcher shop at Lakemba. Notes found in the unit occupied by Brigitte included paper with the name and telephone number of Abdul Rakib Hasan. 
     
      
    16 Ninthly, there was the evidence of Ahmad and Altaf that Hasan had visited Willie Brigitte’s flat in company with another man who said he was an architect in the city and who said he came from Sialkot in Pakistan and had recently returned from a visit to Pakistan. In addition, Hasan was with the accused when he made the visit to the Internet Café at Campsie and made the telephone calls observed under surveillance on 26 October 2003. 
     
      
    17 Finally, there is the material found in the accused’s possession on CD’s and DVD’s. This considerable body of material relates to LeT and violent Jihaad. There was also a connection between this material and material found in Hasan’s premises. 
     
      
    18 Putting all of this material together for the purposes of the submission, the Crown maintained that the evidence sought to be excluded in the present application is powerful evidence in support of the Crown’s circumstantial case going to the accused’s knowledge and intention in relation to the offences charged.  
     
      
    19 The arguments advanced by Mr Boulten SC on the s 137 point focussed on a very considerable body of media material collected by the defence team to demonstrate the excessive publicity generated by the presence of Willie Brigitte in Australia. It is essentially because of this material that Mr Boulten suggested the jury will “over estimate” and “over value” any evidence that mentions the name Willie Brigitte. The Crown responded to this argument by suggesting that any possible danger of misuse by the jury of the subject body of evidence could be adequately eradicated by appropriate directions from the court. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    20 One of the cardinal provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 is s 56. In Odgers Uniform Evidence Law 5th Edition at page 114 it is described as “the key provision regarding the admissibility of evidence” in Chapter 3. The section provides: - 
     
      
       
        
        “56(1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    21 As is recognised and stated by the High Court in Smith v The Queen [2001] 206 CLR 650 at 653, the first question to be asked when an issue of the present kind arises is whether the evidence is relevant. Although questions of relevance may raise “nice questions of judgment”, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is either relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. The simple fact is that irrelevant evidence may not be received. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. 
     
      
    22 In determining relevance in a criminal trial, it is important, and indeed fundamental to identify the ultimate issues. These will be ordinarily expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged in the light of the defence, if known. Section 55 of the Evidence Act states that evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. Behind these ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue (Smith at 654; Papakosmos v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 307; 312 and 321-322. 
     
      
    23 For present purposes, the facts in issue extend to and include the mental ingredients of the charges against the accused, described in the Criminal Code Act as fault elements: for example, the physical acts of the accused must have been deliberate; they must have been connected with the preparation for a terrorist act; and the accused must have known, that is have been aware, of the connection. In relation to count 2, the Crown alleges that the accused “intentionally” did an act in preparation for a terrorist act and this state of mind must be proved as well. All the fault elements involved in each charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    24 The material sought to adduced by the Crown (including the body of evidence identified by Mr Boulten SC and which forms the subject of the present application) is, in my view, all material, which, if it were accepted, could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fault elements I have identified. Section 55 of the Evidence Act is broadly stated and is designed to capture as relevant evidence that logically and reasonably has the capacity to bear upon the assessment that the jury, properly instructed, will have to make in the light of the issues at trial. I accept that the evidence of the association between the accused and Willie Brigitte does not appear to go so far as to demonstrate his involvement in the physical elements of the offences with which the accused is charged. Of course, if the evidence of the relationship did tend to go that far, there could be no question other than the evidence would be regarded as relevant. The question is: does the more restricted nature of the relationship bring about a situation where the evidence could be said to lack relevance in the sense postulated by s 55 of the Evidence Act? In my opinion, the answer to that question must be in the negative. 
     
      
    25 I turn now to consider the second argument raised by Mr Boulten SC. I have endeavoured to read the very significant body of material collected from media releases for the purposes of the argument. I also take into account that this is by no means the only media attention that would have been made in relation to Willie Brigitte at the time of his arrest and into the period of 2004 when the accused was himself arrested. I agree with Mr Boulten that many of the statements made in the press are simply examples of sensationalism that have no possible warrant in fact. Mr Boulten’s main argument is that the members of the jury may have seen some at least of this material and may recollect it so that any mention of Willie Brigitte will carry with it the possibility that whatever evidence is adduced at this trial will be misused I am unable to accept this submission. 
     
      
    26 First, it is now nearly two and a half years since Willie Brigitte was arrested and deported from Australia. While general impressions may remain in the minds of some members of the public, I am confident that detail will have been forgotten. Secondly, it is two years since the accused himself was arrested and, while there have been references to Willie Brigitte since that time in the media, there is no reason to suppose that the accused himself received the treatment that Brigitte did in the press. Thirdly, I agree with the Crown’s submissions that an appropriate direction to the jury will bring home to them a self evident matter, namely that they are to confine their attention to evidence about Brigitte that is presented in this trial. There may be other matters that ought be included in such a direction and I will, no doubt, be assisted in that regard by suggestions from both the Crown and the defence at the appropriate time.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him on 1 April 2005 in respect of seven offences of sexual assault committed on three separate occasions on his step-daughter who was aged nine at the time of the first six counts and twelve at the time of the last count. 
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment with an overall non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 2 years. The individual counts and sentences were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count One 
       
      Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 10 contrary to s 61M(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years. The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of nine months, dating from 1 April 2005 and expiring on 31 December 2005. 
       
       
      Count Two 
       
      Sexual intercourse with a child under 10 contrary to s 66A of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. A sentence of a fixed term of four years imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was to commence on 1 April 2005 and expire on 31 March 2009. 
       
       
      Count 3 was an alternative to count 4. 
       
       
      Count Four 
       
      Attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10, contrary to s 66B of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years. A fixed term of three years imprisonment was imposed, commencing on 1 April 2005 and expiring on 31 March 2008. 
       
       
      Count Five 
       
      Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 10 contrary to s 61M(2), carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years. Two years imprisonment was imposed, commencing on 1 April 2005 and expiring on 31 March 2007. 
       
       
      Count Six 
       
      Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 10 years contrary to s 61M(2) of the  
      Crimes Act,  
      carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years. A fixed term of 2 years to date from 1 April 2007, expiring on 31 March 2009 was imposed. 
       
       
      Count Seven 
       
      Sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years for which a sentence of four years was imposed and set to commence on 1 April 2007 and expire on 31 March 2011. 
       
       
      Count Eight 
       
      Aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       carrying a maximum penalty of 7 years. The judge set a non-parole period of one year commencing on 1 April 2011, to expire on 31 March 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 31 March 2014. 
       
       
      The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 31 March 2012. 
       
      
    3 Accordingly, the sentence with respect to counts 6 and 7 commenced two years after the sentences for counts 1, 2 and 5. 
     
      
       
      The sentence with respect to count eight was ordered to commence 4 years after the second series of offences.  
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The facts are not in dispute and were set out by the sentencing judge in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “…, the complainant, was born on 5 July 1990 and in July of 1996 the complainant, her mother and her sisters moved in with the offender. Her mother married the offender in January 1997. 
        
       
       
        
        …. The offender was born in Samoa and is now 33 years of age. He came to Australia in 1996 shortly before he first met the complainant’s mother and the marriage which they subsequently entered into has produced three daughters now aged seven, five and four. 
        
       
       
        
        On 19 November 1999 the complainant’s mother was taken to hospital by ambulance. She remained there until 24 November 1999. The complainant was nine years of age at the time. One night during that period the offender told the complainant to go to sleep in his bed. She went to the offender’s room and complied with his request and at the time was wearing underwear and pyjamas. The offender came into the room and closed the door. He took off his lava skirt and got into bed and began moving his hands along the complainant’s body. He touched the complainant’s breast with his hand constituting the offence covered by the first count. 
        
       
       
        
        He then removed the complainant’s underpants and put his fingers inside her vagina, the act which constituted the offence in the second count. He then moved his body on top of the complainant and tried several times to push his penis into her vagina. The complainant stated that his penis did not fit and that he was hurting her. He then used his hand to try to push his penis into her vagina and moved his body up and down. It is this attempt at penile penetration which has been ultimately accepted as attempted sexual intercourse and is the subject therefore of count number 4. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant tried to move away but the offender held her wrists. The offender then swung his body around so that his feet were near the complainant’s head and he placed her hand on his penis and held it there for about 30 seconds, this being the act coming within count 5. Before leaving the room the offender told the complainant, ‘If you tell anyone I swear I’ll fix you up.’ 
        
       
       
        
        That ends the account of the matters relevant to counts 1 through to 5 inclusive. I now turn to the event which gave rise to the offences under counts 6 and 7. Some time during the night of 15 April 2000 the offender went into the complainant’s bedroom at their house which was then at Bonnyrigg. He got into her bed and tried to remove her nightgown and underwear. The complainant told the offender, ‘Don’t’ touch me otherwise I’ll tell mum.’ He replied, ‘Don’t worry, I won’t touch you.’ The offender then removed the complainant’s underwear and stroked her breasts over the top of her nightgown constituting the act which is the subject of count 6. 
        
       
       
        
        After this the offender pushed his fingers under the complainant’s clothes and into her vagina and moved his hand around for about 30 seconds constituting the act in count 7. The complainant describes his action as follows: ‘It felt like he was smoothing something out.’ She states he used four fingers and, ‘He tried to make space for his own hand to get in like because my legs were pinched in.’ The complainant was at this time still nine years of age. The complainant’s mother, …, went into the bedroom to check on her. The offender rushed past the mother and out of the room. She asked what he was doing and he said, ‘I heard a noise and came to see what it was.’ The mother returned to the complainant’s room later in the night. She lifted the bedcovers and saw that her daughter was not wearing any underwear. 
        
       
       
        
        When the complainant woke up the following morning her mother asked her why she was sleeping that way and the complainant said, ‘You better go and ask dad’, that clearly being a reference to the offender. She then told her mother that ‘I told him to stop and he wouldn’t stop. He was touching my private part.’ She also said that this had happened before when her mother was in hospital for a long time. This was a reference to the period in November of 1999 referred to in counts 1 through to 5. 
        
       
       
        
        The mother then spoke to the offender and he told her, ‘No I didn’t have sex with her, I only touched her private parts with my fingers, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.’ The mother called the complainant into the room after asking her why she did not tell her mother the first time something happened. The mother asked, ‘What else did he do?’ The offender replied, ‘I touched her private part with my fingers. The complainant said, ‘He only used his fingers to touch my rude part.’ The mother then made the offender apologise to the complainant, which he did. 
        
       
       
        
        After the offender left the room the complainant told her mother, ‘He was lying next to me and I felt his fingers inside of my private part.’ The offender left the house and moved into the garage for a couple of weeks. The complainant moved into a bedroom with her three sisters. 
        
       
       
        
        About a week later the offender and the mother met with Bishop Nua of their church. I should explain that the family, and in particular the offender, were members of the Mormon Church of which Bishop Nua was a senior member. During this meeting the offender told Bishop Nua, ‘I did something that was wrong. I touched my daughter’s private parts.’ He also said, ‘I only did it one time.’ The mother was also with the offender a few weeks later when he spoke to another member of their church, a President Saikaly. She saw the offender go into a room with President Saikaly. About half an hour later the offender came out and said to the mother: ‘Please tell President Saikaly that I only did it once, not twice.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I come finally to the circumstances surrounding the offence in count 8 which occurred some three years later. On 5 May 2003 the mother was working a night shift. The offender was due to fly to western Samoa the next day. On this particular night the complainant was asleep on a foam mattress on the floor in a bedroom with her baby sisters. The offender came into the bedroom, moved the sleeping sisters to another bed and lay on the mattress with the complainant. He then touched her breasts on top of her clothes. The complainant was by this time 12 years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        After that incident, on 15 July 2003, the mother and her children left the offender’s home and went to live with her mother. On 28 July 2003 the complainant was interviewed by officers at Ashfield joint investigation response team and she told them about the first two incidents. She was further interviewed on 29 August 2003 when she described the third incident. 
        
       
       
        
        On 5 September 2003 the complainant was examined by Dr Maria Nittis at Liverpool Hospital. Dr Nittis noted a deep notch that is more than a 50 per cent transection on the interior half of the complainant’s hymeneal wall. In her opinion such an injury could only have resulted from penetration of the hymeneal opening at some time in the past. The offender was arrested on 7 October 2003. He declined at that stage to answer police questions about the allegations and was subsequently charged. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 – His Honour erred by having regard to the standard non-parole periods in respect of counts 1 to 7 which were not applicable, the offences being committed before 1 February 2003 
       
      
    5 The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant having regard to his guilty pleas. However, he accepted that only the pleas in relation to count eight and count four were entered at the earliest opportunity. His Honour reduced the sentence in relation to those counts by approximately twenty percent and in relation to the remaining counts reduced the sentence by fifteen percent. 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge considered the impact of the applicant’s actions upon the victim and analysed and had regard to the matters which he was required to consider pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    7 No complaint is made about this analysis. 
     
      
    8 However, it is submitted that his Honour fell into error by assuming that counts one to seven which were committed before 1 February 2003 were subject to s 54A of the Act which provides for the imposition of standard non-parole periods. In this respect the Crown concedes that error has occurred. 
     
      
    9 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before I proceed to the sentences themselves there is one other matter which needs to be placed on the record as far as the relevant legal rules which must be taken into account and that is that at least two of the three offences which are the subject of the various counts in this case are subject to s 54A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. That is, they are, at least on the face of it, offences which require the imposition of a standard non parole period in what is considered to be the mid range of such sentences. I am referring here specifically to the offences in counts 2 and 7, 1, 5 and 6 and also in 8. They involve three different offences which are explicitly referred to in the schedule to s 54D. 
        
       
       
        
        There are, however, reasons in this case why that Act does not require any direct application. The first and most important is the plea of guilty. My understanding of the application of s 54A is that it is assumed to apply most appropriately in cases where the matter has gone to trial and where a guilty verdict has ultimately been reached and that the standard non parole periods therefore are only of limited relevance when it comes to a case of this kind where there has been a comprehensive plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        It is also subject, and I do not propose to go into this matter in any detail, to the underlying acknowledgement in the relevant authorities which have had an opportunity to consider the range of factors, including those under 21A, that might mitigate against the imposition of a mid range sentence. For all those reasons I am satisfied that at best the standard sentence imposed in the schedule under that section is only of general guidance and certainly does not in any way bind me in a strict sense to the imposition of a sentence of the kind I should nonetheless for the record, by way of summary, indicate the two points of general guidance in this regard, that is, the mid range and maximum sentence to which I must have regard as an indication of the seriousness of the offence. The offence in counts 2 and 7 carries a mid range sentence under s 54A of 15 years and a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment under the relevant section of the Crimes Act. In the case of the offence in counts 1, 5 and 6, the relevant periods of imprisonment are five and ten years and under count 8 five and seven years. 
        
       
       
        
        While none of those periods of imprisonment are in any way for the reasons I have already indicated, regarded as more than indicative, they are not provisions which I should ignore. They reflect the comparative level of seriousness, apart from anything else, of the various offences.” 
        
       
      
    10 In fact it was only count eight, which was committed on 5 May 2003, which attracted the operation of the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Act. With respect to the offence of aggravated and indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act the prescribed standard non-parole period is five years. 
     
      
    11 Although his Honour considered the Act to apply he nevertheless concluded that he should depart from the relevant provision in the circumstances of this case. However, as the decision in R v Ohar (2004) 59 NSWLR 596 makes plain error has occurred and his Honour has had regard to an irrelevant consideration. 
     
      
    12 That is not the end of the matter. In my opinion there are a number of objective factors which point to the need for a significant sentence to have been imposed. The offences which the applicant committed were aggravated by the fact that they involved a gross abuse of trust. The applicant sexually assaulted his own step-daughter who was entitled to expect both care and protection from him. 
     
      
    13 I have already related the agreed facts. Although count 1 was confined to a touching of the breasts, it took place at night, whilst the applicant was in bed with the victim, at a time when the victim’s mother was in hospital. It was an offence committed on a young child, just 9 years old. The penalty imposed was 9 months and I am satisfied that no lesser penalty was warranted. 
     
      
    14 Count 2 was part of the events constituting count 1 and was a serious instance of digital penetration. No lesser penalty than that imposed of 4 years was warranted, and in any event such sentence was made wholly concurrent with the sentences for other offences. 
     
      
    15 After the act constituting count 2 the applicant moved his body on top of the victim and tried several times to push his penis into her vagina. When the victim told him it did not fit and it was hurting her, the applicant persisted by using his hand to try to push his penis into her vagina and by moving his body up and down. When the complainant moved away the applicant held her wrists. For this offence, which was count 4, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years. Bearing in mind that the maximum penalty for the offence of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 is 25 years, 3 years must be regarded as the lowest penalty that could have been imposed in all the circumstances. 
     
      
    16 After the applicant’s unsuccessful attempt at sexual intercourse the applicant continued his assault by swinging his body around, moving his feet near her head and placing the victim’s hand on his penis (count 5). The applicant threatened the complainant, “If you tell anyone I swear I’ll fix you up.” For this offence which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years was imposed. Having regard to the circumstances in which it was committed no lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    17 Counts 6 and 7 were committed on the night of 15 April 2000 when the applicant went into the victim’s bedroom at their family home at Bonnyrigg. The applicant got into the victim’s bed, and tried to remove her nightgown and underwear. Notwithstanding the victim’s protest, “Don’t touch me otherwise I’ll tell Mum” the applicant falsely reassured her by saying, “Don’t worry I won’t touch you”, and then removed her underwear and stroked her breasts over the top of her nightgown (count 6). The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years. Having regard to the fact that the applicant disregarded the 9 year old victim’s protests, and did so in the very room and in the very bed in which she was entitled to feel safe, no lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    18 The applicant then pushed his four fingers into the victim’s vagina, before the victim’s mother made her way into the victim’s bedroom (count 7). For this offence the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years. I am satisfied that this sentence was appropriate for this serious assault committed on a 9 year old girl at night time and in her own bed. 
     
      
    19 The final offence was committed on 5 May 2003 when the applicant had the sole care of the family whilst the wife worked a night shift. The victim, who was then 12, was asleep on a foam mattress on the floor in a bedroom with her baby sisters. The applicant moved the sisters to another bed and lay down with the complainant and touched her breasts on top of her clothes. For this offence committed on a 12 year old girl, at night, in her home, when she was deprived of the protection of her mother who was out working, no doubt in order to help support her family, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year. In circumstances where the applicant had been allowed back into the home after the (partial discovery) of his actions in 2000 the applicant had an increased culpability. No lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    20 The offences have had serious consequences for the victim. Her family life has been seriously disrupted, the family unit destroyed, and she has suffered ongoing trauma. Fortunately it would appear that she has been progressing towards resolving her psychological difficulties. 
     
      
    21 Although the applicant pleaded guilty the evidence indicates that it took some considerable time before he was prepared to admit to all of his offending. He has now achieved some insight into the very serious nature of his offences but this was not always the case. In his favour is the fact that he has apparently committed himself to rehabilitation and there is psychiatric opinion that he is unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    22 Having regard to all of these matters, notwithstanding the fact that error has occurred, I am satisfied that the sentences which his Honour imposed were appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two: His Honour erred by failing to give effect to his finding of special circumstances. 
       
      
    23 In his remarks on sentence his Honour makes clear that although there were a total of eight counts, they could be conveniently viewed as offences committed on three separate occasions. Accordingly, his Honour determined that, although there should be some overlap of the sentences, identifiable punishment in relation to each of the separate occasions would be appropriate. His Honour also determined that in view of the cumulative impact of the sentences and “the effect of the sentences imposed with regard to the later events, and in particular the very last of them, namely that covered in count 8 I see no useful purpose to be achieved in dividing any periods of custody imposed with regard to the earlier offences in distinguishing between a non-parole period and a period on parole. Any appropriate period on parole with regard to those earlier offences would on overall consideration of the matter be overtaken by the later offences [sic] to the extent that they are cumulative in their effects rather than concurrent. I do not propose to artificially distinguish between a period on parole and a non-parole period with every one of the offences.” 
     
      
    24 During his Honour’s discussion of the personal circumstances of the applicant and his prospect of rehabilitation his Honour makes the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “Returning to what I was saying, the fact is that at this stage he has effectively lost his wife and his children and that has had a devastating effect on the offender. He does feel very sorry for himself. On the other hand I have no doubt that he is genuine in what he says about what he has described on some occasions as, ‘his big mistake’ and that he does now see, although he took a long time for this to apparently penetrate, the seriousness, the inappropriateness and the gross breach of trust which his actions involved. In so far as those matters are relevant and should be taken into account they are matters which are of some substance as far as mitigation is concerned, in particular and I will come back to this in due course, in any relationship between a non-parole period and a period on parole as part of the overall sentence.” 
        
       
      
    25 Counsel for the applicant submits that this last sentence has significance in determining the approach which his Honour was proposing to take in relation to a finding of “special circumstances” and the appropriate period of parole. It is submitted that when viewed with later remarks it should be accepted that his Honour intended to provide a greater non-parole period in relation to the whole sentence than is provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
    26 His Honour then passed sentence in relation to each count, one to seven. Consistent with his Honour’s intentions a parole period is not provided and his Honour makes no reference to “special circumstances.” His Honour then and separately from counts one to seven turns to consider the appropriate sentence in relation to count 8. He says as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I come finally to count number 8. Again, it is necessary to preface the sentence with some remarks about the particular character of this offence and its relationship with the earlier offences. What is particularly serious about this offence is that it was committed some considerable time after the earlier offences, but most importantly, after a period of at least partial remorse and counselling. Despite that experience the offender nonetheless took yet another opportunity to repeat admittedly one of the less serious offences which had been committed earlier. But the very fact that it was done in these circumstances does lend some weight to its seriousness and to the need for the imposition of a sentence which is for that reason cumulative rather than concurrent. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand it is at this point that proper account has to be taken in order to produce an overall result consistent with the principle of totality which takes due account of the circumstances that bear on the length of a period on parole and which are generally described as special circumstances. In that regard I have already said something about this matter and I do not propose to repeat what I have said already, namely that the matters of particular relevance by way of special circumstances the commitment to and the likelihood of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        Sufficient to say at this stage that while there were reasons for some qualifications to any conclusions that might be drawn in the offender’s favour, I am satisfied on balance that there is a real commitment to rehabilitation, and more to the point, that there is certainly some room for further counselling to which I am confident the offender will be committed and from which he will gain further insights and further assistance in ensuring the absence of any possibility of re-offending. Because the last of the offences was committed after 1 February 2003 the appropriate form of sentence is as follows. That the offender is convicted and sentenced to a non-parole period of one year commencing on 1 April 2011 and expiring on 31 March 2012. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years to commence on the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 31 March 2014 making a total sentence of three years comprising the non-parole period and the balance of sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        I find special circumstances which I have already identified and further therefore order that the offender be eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour then turns to summarise the effective sentence which he has imposed and says: 
     
      
       
        
        “Can I just, in fairness to the offender, summarise the effect of all of those various sentences insofar as concurrency and accumulation is concerned. You are now sentenced to a total period of seven years in custody followed by a period on parole of two years. That is the effect overall of the sentences on each of the seven counts which I have been required to deal with.” 
        
       
      
    28 A number of matters appear from these remarks. Firstly his Honour made plain that he did not propose to provide a period on parole in relation to the earlier offences. Accordingly, in relation to those offences a finding of special circumstances was irrelevant and I am satisfied that his Honour did not intend to make it. However, his Honour was concerned that in imposing a separate sentence in relation to count 8 a finding of special circumstances was appropriate and was made. Having regard to his Honour’s earlier remarks that he intended to ensure an appropriate relationship between the non-parole period and a period on parole as part of the overall sentence his Honour’s later conclusion that a greater period on parole than the statute provides was appropriate in relation to count 8. It must be understood as a practical working out of that expressed intention that his Honour had in mind that given the multiplicity of offences he would not provide a period on parole except in relation to count 8 and in that respect would ensure an appropriate relationship existed between the overall period in imprisonment and the period on parole “as part of the overall sentence.” 
     
      
    29 Following the original sentencing hearing the matter was again placed before his Honour pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the course of that hearing his Honour made plain his intention in relation to the original sentences. In particular he repeated the fact that by reason of the multiplicity of earlier offences he had not intended to provide a period on parole. In his Honour’s opinion to do so would have been a meaningless exercise because the applicant would have still been in prison in relation to a later offence when he was hypothetically on parole in relation to an earlier matter. His Honour also makes plain that the sentences which he imposed were those which he intended. In particular as I understand his Honour’s remarks in discussion with counsel he intended to provide a total non-parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    30 Findings by a sentencing judge of special circumstances have given rise to difficulties in some cases where an accumulation of sentences has been necessary. There have been cases where an accumulation has resulted in a non-parole period greater than 75% and the overall result has failed to give effect to a finding of special circumstances. However, the cases to which the court was referred are quite different to the circumstances of the present case.  
     
      
    31 In Michael Gordon Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 the offender was sentenced at a time when he was already serving a 9 month minimum term. Three cumulative minimum terms were imposed with the effect that the total sentence imposed was a minimum term of 3 years and 9 months with an additional term of 3 months. Because the offender was already in custody in relation to other offences the offender would have spent only 5% of the overall period of the sentence on parole. 
     
      
    32 Of these circumstances the Court said at 60-62: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the minimum term is accumulated upon an existing minimum term, that fact may of itself constitute special circumstances justifying a departure from the one-third rule … 
        
       
       
        
        … special circumstances may also exist in the appropriate case where a court is imposing a series of cumulative sentences, so that it can ensure a proper proportion between the total minimum term and the effective additional term – even if it is only to produce an effective additional term equal to, or roughly equivalent to, one-third of the total minimum term which the prisoner is to serve. It obviously would not be appropriate to apply such a principle in every case. However, the present case was such an appropriate case, because of the extraordinary disproportion created simply by adhering to the formula provided by s 5(2) … 
        
       
       
        
        The judge did not, however, give any consideration to whether special circumstances were established by the extraordinary disproportion – created by the sentences which he was imposing simply by adhering to the formula provided by s 5(2) – between the total minimum term of four and a half years and the effective additional term of three months. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the judge made an error in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. In my view, the sentence should be restructured so as to produce the result that the additional term is one-third of the total minimum term, but maintaining the present total sentences of the two courts of four years and nine months.” 
        
       
      
    33 In R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 743 the offender had spent periods in custody before he was sentenced. Although the overall sentence was within the appropriate range the failure to back date the commencement meant that there was not the appropriate proportion between the minimum and additional terms. This Court held that the period of pre-sentence custody was itself sufficient to constitute special circumstances. Because the judge had found that there should be a longer than usual period of supervision on parole this Court re-sentenced the offender. 
     
      
    34 In R v Bolamatu [2002] NSWCCA 454 the offender had served a significant period in pre-sentence custody and the sentencing judge made findings of special circumstances referable to his chronic mental condition and the need for a longer period of supervision. However, the sentencing judge failed to account for the pre-sentence custody with the consequence that although he intended to provide for an extended period of parole the sentence imposed failed to do so. 
     
      
    35 In R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215 the sentencing judge structured each sentence so as to reflect a finding of special circumstances and in each case the non-parole period was provided as 66.6% of the head sentence. However, when accumulated the overall sentence was 75% of the head sentence. The sentencing judge had found special circumstances and this Court was satisfied that his Honour had intended to give effect to his finding of special circumstances over the whole sentence. As this had not been achieved the sentence was quashed and this Court re-sentenced. 
     
      
    36 There have been a number of cases where this Court has intervened where a sentencing judge has made a finding of special circumstances but, due to a mathematical error in computation, has failed to give effect to that intention. R v Sharrock [1999] NSWCCA 289 was a case where the judge found special circumstances in an accumulation of sentences and the need for the applicant to be closely supervised for a significant period on release. However, his Honur failed to give effect to that finding in the individual sentences or the overall terms.  
     
      
    37 In R v Thornberry [2000] NSWCCA 526 the sentencing judge found special circumstances having regard to the offender’s youth and need for extended emotional and moral development assistance. However, the actual sentence did not reflect this finding and this Court intervened.  
     
      
    38 In R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86 the sentencing judge had found a need for supervision upon release but failed to reflect that finding in the non-parole period that was imposed.  
     
      
    39 R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139 was another case where there was a finding of special circumstances in a need for a greater period of supervision on parole but this Court found that the finding had not been carried through in the sentence which was actually imposed. 
     
      
    40 In R v Heather May Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376 the sentencing judge sentenced the offender in relation to three offences. His Honour provided a total sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. There was no finding of special circumstances, the sentencing judge did not advert to it. However, his Honour had also not indicated any intention to depart from the statutory formula and accordingly this Court intervened and re-sentenced to provide a non-parole period in conformity with the normal statutory proportion of 75%. 
     
      
    41 In the present case I am satisfied that, but for one matter, his Honour has carried into effect his intentions when sentencing the applicant. The mathematical outcome produces a result slightly higher than the statutory ratio between a non-parole period and a period on parole. This is a result of his Honour, quite deliberately, not providing a period on parole in relation to the earlier offences. If his Honour had not taken this approach the head sentence imposed on the applicant would have been greater. His Honour makes this plain in the later hearing.  
     
      
    42 The present matter is quite unlike the cases to which this Court has been referred. This is not a case where his Honour has found special circumstances but failed to reflect it in the sentences which he has imposed. Having imposed the sentences for the earlier offences without a non-parole period his Honour deliberately provides an additional term of one year imprisonment in relation to count 8. Rather than provide for the statutory ratio in relation to this offence his Honour provides an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    43 Although his Honour intended this result he nowhere indicates that he intended the overall sentences should depart from the statutory ratio. He does not advert to the matter. In this respect, only am I satisfied that error has occurred. Applying the statutory formula the total non-parole period would be 6 years and 9 months. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The overall sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    44 I have set out the objective facts found by the trial judge. It is an account of serious offending over an extended period. 
     
      
    45 The applicant submitted that the sentence was excessive by reason of the fact that “the offence did not involve penile penetration, nor the repeated infliction of such sexual violence.” Although this may be technically correct the applicant attempted to force his penis into the victim’s vagina even when told it did not fit and he was hurting her. I do not accept that the applicant’s offending fell at the lower end of the scale of offences. 
     
      
    46 The offences committed by the applicant were serious indeed involving a gross abuse of trust of a small child in his care. The offences were repeated over a lengthy period of time and I am satisfied that no lesser sentence could have been imposed. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    47 To give effect to my conclusion with respect to ground 2 the appeal against sentence in relation to count 8 should be allowed in part. To give effect to the statutory ratio a finding of special circumstances is appropriate and the applicant should be re-sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 months and an overall term of 3 years. The appropriate orders are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentences granted. 
       
      2. Dismiss the appeals against the sentences imposed on counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence on count 8 allowed in part. Sentence on count 8 quashed. 
       
      4. In lieu of the sentence imposed on count 8, the applicant is sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment 
       
        
        (a) set a non-parole period of 9 months starting on 1 April 2011 and expiring on 31 December 2011 on which day the applicant is eligible for release on parole. 
         
        (b) impose a balance of term of 2 years 3 months starting on 1 January 2012 and expiring on 31 March 2014. 
        
       
      
    48 ROTHMAN J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and his reasons therefor. 
     
      
    49 To the extremely helpful digest of cases I would add R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252. In that case, the sentences had been imposed with some accumulation but not wholly cumulatively. There was otherwise no finding of special circumstances and the Court held that the mere occurrence of partial accumulation will usually amount to special circumstances in order to preserve the statutory ratio for the overall sentence. 
     
      
    50 While the existence of special circumstances is a matter wholly within the judgment of the sentencing judge, unless the remarks make clear that a departure from the statutory ratio is intended for the overall sentence, it should be presumed that any higher ratio than 3:1 is arithmetic error or oversight. 
     
      
    51 Because of the requirements of s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act there may be a necessity, where special circumstances do exist, to re-assess the initially determined non-parole period by reducing the non-parole period to take account of the need for a longer period of supervision. 
     
      
    52 Special circumstances should not be used to lengthen the total sentence that would otherwise be imposed. 
     
      
    53 SMART AJ: The background is set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree with his reasons for rejecting the appeal on Grounds 1 and 3. 
     
      
    54 In Ground 2 the applicant complains that the judge failed to give effect to his finding of special circumstances. Having dealt at length with Counts 1-2 and 4 to 7 and considerations of a general nature the judge came to Count 8, briefly referred to the circumstances of the commission of this offence and concluded that the sentence for that offence had to be cumulative rather than concurrent. 
     
      
    55 The judge took into account the principle of totality “which takes due account of the circumstances that bear on the length of a period on parole and which are generally described as special circumstances.” By that he meant particularly the commitment to and the likelihood of rehabilitation. He had earlier noted that the applicant’s stated commitment to never re-offend had to be measured against his history, which involved being slow to acknowledge comprehensively what had occurred and earlier led to a lapse which resulted in the commission of the offence the subject of Count 8. The judge was satisfied on balance that the applicant had a real commitment to rehabilitation, including further counselling. 
     
      
    56 The judge then imposed a sentence on Count 8 by setting a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 1 April 2011 and a further term of imprisonment of 2 years expiring on 31 March 2014. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find special circumstances which I have already identified and further therefore order that the offender be eligible for release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
         
        … You are now sentenced to a total of 7 years in custody followed by a period on parole of 2 years.” 
        
       
      
    57 There was debate as to the extent of the judge’s finding of special circumstances. Did it apply to all counts or was it limited in its application to Count 8. The judge made it clear in his summary of the effect of the sentences that he intended that the applicant spend 7 years in prison. 
     
      
    58 The judge does not specifically refer to the accumulation of sentences as being a special circumstance, but he may have meant to include this when he referred to and applied the principle of totality. The judge’s approach to special circumstances centred on his findings as to rehabilitation and re-offending. That was relevant to all counts. He may have intended that the adjustment to the sentence on Count 8 cover this. There is a minor conundrum because he intended non-parole periods totalling 7 years.  
     
      
    59 I would treat the accumulation of the sentences as a special circumstance warranting the adjustment of the sentence on Count 8 so that, overall, the non-parole periods when aggregated do not exceed three-quarters of the total sentences or, put another way, the balance of the term of imprisonment should be about one third of the non-parole period. While the need for rehabilitation is capable of being a special circumstance it does not follow that the sentences should be further adjusted to allow for a longer parole period. The judge regarded a parole period of 2 years as sufficient. I agree. I arrive at the same conclusion as the Chief Judge but by a slightly different route. 
     
      
    60 I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge.

       SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 16 November 2005 an indictment was presented against William Matheson charging him with the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken on 24 November 2003. He pleaded not guilty to this charge and a jury was duly empanelled. On 9 December 2005 the jury found him guilty as charged. The matter was then stood over for submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    2 The story behind this trial is quite an extraordinary one, involving great tragedy to a number of people.  
     
      
    3 Lyndsay Van Blanken was born on 26 August 1985. She was a little over eighteen years old when she met her death in November 2003. She was described as shy and introverted, but she was also a very kindly affectionate girl, with considerable humour and flair. She also had great artistic talent. In mid 2003 she was one of a very small number of people who were accepted as apprentice animators at Disney Toons from amongst a large number of applicants. 
     
      
       
      William Matheson, the offender, was born on 10 August 1982 and was thus three years older than Lyndsay. He was a skilled cellist, and obtained work as a musician whenever it was available. He and Lyndsay first met on 13 April 2001 when Lyndsay’s mother married her stepfather, David Pleasance. Matheson was playing the cello as part of a string quartet which performed at the wedding. A friendship developed between the two of them which gradually became closer and more intimate. On all accounts, however, it was an unusual type of relationship. They rarely, if ever, went out on normal dates. Lyndsay at that stage was living with her mother and stepfather in Carrington Road, Queens Park. The offender was living in Coogee. They used to regularly go out late at night and take long walks together, returning in the early hours of the morning.  
       
      
    4 At the same time, Lyndsay was developing a close relationship over the Internet with an American, Brandon Leonard. They both became so involved in this relationship that Brandon proposed marriage to her in June 2003. When she accepted, he posted her a ring which arrived in July. Brandon himself then arranged to come to Australia. He arrived in Sydney on 9 September, a few weeks after Lyndsay had commenced working for Disney Toons. 
     
      
    5 The impending arrival of Brandon Leonard meant that Lyndsay was forced to do something about her relationship with William Matheson. She discussed this with her sister, Louise Betts. Two days before Brandon’s arrival, she told Matheson that she did not want to see him any more. She did not tell him about Brandon Leonard. However it did not take long for Matheson to find out about Brandon. Within a very few days of the latter’s arrival, Matheson followed Lyndsay near her workplace when she and Brandon were walking arm in arm. He later discovered that they were engaged.. 
     
      
    6 It is clear that Matheson’s attitude toward Lyndsay changed dramatically when he realised that there was another man in her life. Whereas previously their relationship, although close, had been a relatively casual one, he became intense and obsessive. He told Lindsay’s sister Louise that he could not live without her. He started to follow her around and was often seen waiting outside her workplace at lunchtime or when she was due to finish work. In current parlance, he was clearly stalking her.  
     
      
    7 On Friday 21 November Lyndsay told her mother how concerned she was about Matheson. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mum I don’t know what to do about Will, he won’t leave me alone and I’m getting very frightened. I don’t know what to do about it.” 
        
       
      
    8 At about lunchtime, on Saturday 22 November Matheson went with his father to the Bondi Junction Shopping Centre where he purchased a very large cricket bag at the Rebel Sports Store. This bag assumed great significance during the trial, and I will be returning to discuss it later. 
     
      
    9 In the meantime Lyndsay’s relationship with Brandon Leonard had flourished. They were living together in an apartment directly behind the home where her mother and stepfather, Cynthia and David Pleasance lived. It was planned that the two of them, Lyndsay and Brandon would go to the United States for Christmas. Lyndsay was very excited about this. 
     
      
    10 On the morning of Monday 24 November 2003 Lyndsay went to work as usual. At lunchtime, when she left the Disney building with work friends, William Matheson was waiting outside. Lyndsay spent about ten minutes with him and then rejoined her friends. That evening she left work at the normal time, about 5.30, and took a train to Bondi Junction. She started to walk home from the station. Matheson was waiting for her outside the Cock & Bull Hotel, not far from the station. He later said that they walked together towards her home and then parted company near Queens Park, a few blocks from her home. He himself then walked across Queens Park, and went straight to his own home. That night he played the cello in a concert at the Entertainment Centre. Others who were there with him described him as acting quite normally. 
     
      
    11 Lyndsay Van Blanken was never seen alive again. When she failed to come home that night and her mobile phone did not respond to calls, the police were called in. By Wednesday 26 November the matter was being treated very seriously. That day the police conducted an electronically recorded interview with William Matheson who described his movements on the Monday and confirmed that he had last seen Lyndsay at the corner of Edmund and Victoria Streets, Queens Park, which was not far from her home. He was asked about his relationship with Lyndsay and he said that he was naturally upset when she broke it off, but that they had remained friends since then and had seen each other at least once a week. He said that Lyndsay seemed perfectly normal when he last saw her. She was very excited about her proposed trip to the United States with Brandon Leonard.  
     
      
    12 All police investigations as to the whereabouts of Lyndsay Van Blanken proved fruitless until 10 January 2004. On that day, complaints from residents of an apartment block at 52 Queens Park Road, Queens Park, that there was a very bad smell in the building, finally led to investigations being conducted. In a storeroom off a car park on the ground floor of the building a large cricket bag was discovered containing the heavily decomposed body of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Cable ties were found around her neck, indicating that the cause of death was strangulation.  
     
      
    13 When William Matheson heard of the finding of Lyndsay’s body he became extremely disturbed. On 12 January he was admitted to the “Kiloh” Unit, which is the Psychiatric Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital. He was in a state of great distress: weeping and incoherent and talking about suicide. He was diagnosed as suffering from possible schizophrenia and/or possible schizotypal personality disorder, accompanied by depression. He was placed on medication for these conditions but it took some time for his condition to stabilise.  
     
      
    14 It was not until 22 March that Matheson’s treating psychiatrist said that he was fit to be interviewed by the police. The police attention was focussing on him at that point, because of the cricket bag in which Lyndsay’s body had been found. Inquiries revealed that only one bag of its type had been sold in the whole of Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs in the previous six months. That bag was sold from the Rebel Sports Store at Bondi Junction on 22 November 2003 at precisely the same time as William Matheson was in the area, having been driven there by his father. His father had told the police that when his son returned to the car he was carrying a large sports bag.  
     
      
    15 On 22 March 2004, a further electronically recorded interview took place between Detective Sergeant Doueihi and the offender William Matheson. He repeated the account he had given earlier of his movements on 24 November, the day Lyndsay went missing. The police then asked him about the sports bag which he had with him when he rejoined his father on 22 November. Matheson said that he had found it in the street, and he described the precise location where he said he had found it. However film that was taken on a security camera outside the Cock & Bull Hotel at Bondi Junction clearly contradicted his version. This film footage assumed central importance in the trial, for it pointed convincingly to the fact that the bag which was carried by the offender when he got into his father’s car was the bag which had been purchased only a few minutes earlier at the Rebel Store, being the same bag which was later found to contain the body of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Moreover, it showed that Matheson had lied about how he had acquired this bag.  
     
      
    16 A few days later, on 26 March 2004, the police took Matheson on a “walk through” to the locations at Bondi Junction where he said he had found the sports bag and the point where he said he had parted from Lyndsay on the evening of 24 November. He said that after leaving her, he walked straight across Queens Park. Later evidence showed that this would not have been possible, as sports games were taking place on the park at the time. Very significantly, he said that he was familiar with the apartment building at 52 Queens Park Road, Queens Park as he and Lyndsay used to go there and spend some time in one of the storerooms. The room he described was different from the storeroom in which Lyndsay’s body was located.  
     
      
    17 On 31 March 2004 Matheson requested that he be re-interviewed by the police. In this interview he told them that he had experienced auditory hallucinations for a number of years. Voices ordered him to harm or kill people and also to harm himself. He denied however that any of these voices related to Lyndsay Van Blanken. Specifically he denied that the voices had ever told him to harm her. He said that he had never told anyone about these voices because he did not want people to be nervous around him. He told his parents about them for the first time on 11 January 2004, the day before his admission to the Kiloh Centre. He said he had heard these voices for about six years but had never acted on them as he did not want to hurt anybody. He would go out and walk the streets or sleep in parks rather than stay home and risk burning the house and harming his parents, as the voices were telling him to do. 
     
      
    18 Only a small part of this interview was placed before the jury at the trial. The defence had objected to evidence relating to the accused’s mental state going before the jury, and after a voir dire hearing relating to this material I ruled that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value and that it was not to be admitted.  
     
      
    19 On 19 May 2004 Matheson was arrested and charged with the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    20 The Crown case at trial was dependent upon circumstantial evidence, as Matheson had consistently denied his guilt. The purchase of the sports bag was the most powerful single piece of evidence against him, but there were other matters linking him with Lyndsay’s death. These included the fact that he was later found to be in possession of Lyndsay’s art diary, a book which her mother and sister both said she kept with her at all times. There was also evidence of unusual scratches and other markings on his body immediately after 24 November 2003. In addition there were audio tapes and writings made by Matheson. These indicated the extent of his obsession with Lyndsay Van Blanken. Some of them also appeared to reveal knowledge that Lyndsay was dead, although they were made before her body was located. The cumulative effect of all this evidence made for a strong Crown case, and it was not surprising that the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    21 I turn now to say something about William Matheson himself. Most of this comes from the psychiatric and psychological reports which were tendered on sentence. He described himself as having had a relatively happy childhood and a “wonderful” relationship with his parents. Nevertheless, there were some very disturbing events during his childhood. When he was nine, his brother, his only sibling, who was then seventeen years old, committed suicide by jumping off the top floor of the Price of Wales Hospital. It is understood that his brother was suffering from schizophrenia. Matheson’s parents also have a history of psychiatric problems. His father, a retired school teacher, was said to have a schizotypal personality disorder and his mother also suffers from a form of personality disorder. Following her older son’s death, she was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution for a period of time. The household has been described as extremely disorganised. 
     
      
    22 William Matheson did his secondary schooling at the Waverley College. On all accounts it was a difficult time. He was the butt of some serious bullying and clearly felt himself to be an outsider. Although he was said to be above average intelligence, his scholastic results were generally poor to average. He remained at school for his Higher School Certificate but obtained quite a poor result. The one field in which he excelled was music. His mother was an accomplished cellist and he also was very skilled in this instrument. 
     
      
    23 After leaving school Matheson obtained a job as an apprentice doing panel van conversions but he was not interested in this work and he left it after about six months. He has had no full time work since then, but has played the cello in orchestras or groups when called on to do so.  
     
      
    24 When he was about thirteen or fourteen years old Matheson had a period when he took cannabis in quite large doses. It seems that the onset of his auditory hallucinations commenced not long after he ceased taking this drug. He has no other history of substance abuse.  
     
      
    25 Matheson has continued to take anti-psychotic and anti-depressive medication throughout his time in custody. He was placed into protection within a few days of going into custody and is likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. He has been maintaining his studies in music and Latin and has had regular visits from his parents. 
     
      
    26 Two psychiatrists gave evidence on sentence, Dr Michael Giuffrida and Dr Stephen Allnutt. Dr Giuffrida interviewed Matheson at Silverwater on 8 March 2005 and again on 3 January 2006. The doctor had been provided with the major documents in the prosecution brief, including the medical records from the Kiloh Centre relating to Matheson’s presentation between January and March 2004. The doctor provided the defence lawyers with two lengthy reports dated respectively 16 March 2005 and 13 January 2006.  
     
      
    27 Dr Giuffrida noted a marked improvement in Matheson’s mental state on the second time he spoke to him. In March 2005 Matheson had presented as cautious and vague with a remarkably poor recollection of events and times in the past and a significant paucity of understanding as to the meaning and significance of issues. In January 2006 Dr Giuffrida noted that he was relaxed, polite and co-operative and not at all guarded or cautious as he had been previously. On this occasion he was able to provide a clear and coherent account of his history. Dr Giuffrida found no evidence of thought disorder or cognitive impairment. He considered that Matheson suffered from schizophrenia. This had responded reasonably well to medication but a number of the symptoms were continuing. Dr Giuffrida assessed Matheson’s risk factor as being 22 out of 40.  
     
      
    28 Matheson has always maintained his denial of killing Lyndsay Van Blanken and he asserts that he has no memory of anything unusual happening between the two of them on the evening that she went missing. Given that he had already been convicted of Lyndsay’s murder by the time Dr Giuffrida wrote his second report, Dr Giuffrida posited in that report two psychological mechanisms which he said might account for Matheson’s amnesia about the killing. The first related to the illness of schizophrenia, and the second to the horrific nature of the events themselves, which could lead to amnesia, even in persons not suffering from psychosis.  
     
      
    29 Dr Giuffrida was called by the defence on sentence. During his evidence he was told about the evidence that the accused had bought the sports bag in which Lyndsay’s body was later placed, only two days before the killing, and had then lied about how he had acquired the bag. I asked the doctor how that form of preparation, two days earlier, could sit with the killing being the product of a psychiatric illness. Dr Giuffrida answered that that would “tend to go against the likelihood that there was a psychotic mechanism involved in the killing.” The doctor did not resile from his opinion that Matheson was suffering from schizophrenia at the time (or, at the very least, a schizotypal personality disorder), but said that this degree of planning was inconsistent with him being severely psychotic, as a severely psychotic person’s capacity to organise and plan is impaired. Matheson’s schizophrenia might have impaired his judgment and affected his decision making processes, but it could not be put higher than that. 
     
      
    30 Dr Stephen Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, did not believe that Matheson’s psychiatric condition was as serious as diagnosed by Dr Giuffrida or that it played any causative role in the killing of Lyndsay Van Blanken. Dr Allnutt saw Matheson on three occasions in February and March 2006 and provided the Crown with a lengthy report dated 9 March 2006. In his report, and again in his evidence, Dr Allnutt expressed scepticism about the diagnosis of schizophrenia in Matheson’s case. He preferred a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. I do not propose to explore this difference in diagnosis in any detail. As Dr Allnutt pointed out, it is a difference of degree only, namely the point on the spectrum of mental health where the offender lies. There is no doubt that Matheson lies towards the disturbed end of the spectrum. Precisely where he lies on that end is, in my view, of not great significance in the circumstances of this case. This is because, as Dr Giuffrida conceded, the offender’s illness, if it was that, did not have a significant causative effect upon this killing. The most that can be said is that it might have led to some impairment of judgment, a matter which Dr Allnutt strongly disputed. 
     
      
    31 As Dr Allnutt pointed out, the ERISP between the police and Matheson on 26 November 2003 provided significant insight into Matheson’s mental condition less than two days after the killing. Dr Allnutt said that he saw in that interview little or no evidence that would lead him to believe that Matheson was suffering from a major mental illness. Matheson dealt with questions as to what might have happened to Lyndsay in a manner that Dr Allnutt said showed “quite excellent judgment” given that it was Matheson himself who had killed her, and he therefore had to be dissembling in his answers. Dr Allnutt pointed out that later on the night of the killing Matheson went home, got changed and went to the Entertainment Centre where he played the cello in a public performance. The doctor could find no evidence to support the conclusion that he was suffering from an impairment of judgment at that time. 
     
      
    32 In my view Dr Allnutt’s analysis is very compelling. In the end, I find that whatever psychiatric condition the offender was suffering from at the time had little causative effect upon this killing. It might have and probably did produce some impairment of judgment, but its ameliorating effects were of a minor order only. 
     
      
    33 Where does all this lead to in the sentencing process? The sentencing legislation requires that the court first set a non-parole period and then the balance of the sentence which, in the absence of special circumstances, is not to exceed one third of the non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for the crime of murder is twenty years. This is applicable to offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the crime in question. The objective circumstances of this case must, in my view, put it in the more serious range. Lyndsay’s killing was clearly premeditated and planned. Both the buying of the sports bag and the preparation of the cable ties with which she was strangled, bear testament to this. It is therefore difficult to see it as a “crime of passion”, as urged by the defence. The killing itself was brutal and cruel to the extreme. The cable ties used to strangle Lyndsay were such that, once in place, they could only be tightened. It was impossible to loosen or release them. We will never know the ruse by which Matheson lured Lyndsay to the place where she met her death. Once there, when she realised what was going to happen, one can only start to imagine the horror she must have suffered. It is a horror which haunts her mother and her sister to this day, as attested in their very moving victim impact statements.  
     
      
    34 I should say that I have taken those statements into account, but in accordance with the legislation I have not used them in determining the sentence in this matter. 
     
      
    35 All these matters lead me to conclude that the objective circumstances of this killing brings it above the mid-range of seriousness, even for the crime of murder. This is, however by no means the end of the matter. I am also obliged to take into account aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A of the relevant legislation and under the common law. The aggravating features under s 21A which are relevant to this case (and which are not inherent in the charge of murder) are, under paragraph (c), that it involved the use of a weapon, and under paragraph (n) that it was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    36 There are no mitigating features whatsoever in relation to this offence. However there are a number in relation to the offender himself. He is still a very young man, only twenty-three years old. He was a person of prior good character with no record of previous convictions. Whilst his mental disorder may have had little causal relationship with this killing, it is still a highly relevant matter in relation to other aspects of the sentencing process, particularly relating to risk factors and to his need for continuing treatment and supervision. In this regard it is worth noting that Matheson’s presentation has visibly changed since his first ERISP in November 2003. In later ERISPS his affect has been much flatter, and he has put on a great deal of weight. I can only assume that this is the product of the medication he has been taking. 
     
      
    37 Imprisonment is particularly harsh for this offender. Since very shortly after going into custody he has been kept in protection, and he is likely to remain there for most of, if not all, of his sentence. His present regime allows him only about two hours each day outside his cell. 
     
      
    38 Assessing the offender’s risk factor is a very difficult exercise given that we know so little about what motivated him to carry out this brutal and apparently senseless killing. Dr Giuffrida assessed it in the middle range, and in the absence of any contrary evidence I think I should accept this as generally correct. There is no doubt that Matheson will need to continue his medication, probably for the rest of his life. This, if nothing else, provides “special circumstances” which entitle me to vary the normal proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence, so that his medication regime can be supervised for a significant period after his return to the community. 
     
      
    39 The objective seriousness of this killing is, as I have already said, above the mid-range of seriousness even for an offence of murder. On the other hand, the mitigating features relating to the offender personally, as opposed to the offence, require a significant reduction in what would otherwise be the appropriate non-parole period. Balancing all these features I consider that a non-parole period of eighteen years, should be applied in his case. The head sentence is to be twenty-seven years. 
     
      
    40 WILLIAM HAROLD MATHESON for the murder of Lyndsay Van Blanken I sentence you to a non-parole period of eighteen years to commence on 19 May 2004 and to expire on 18 May 2022. The balance of your term of imprisonment will be nine years, expiring on 18 May 2031, a total sentence of twenty-seven years.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta on 1 June 2005 by Delaney DCJ. The applicant entered pleas of guilty to all counts on two indictments. The first indictment contained a count of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence (the serious indictable offence being aggravated sexual assault); two counts of indecent assault; and three counts of aggravated sexual assault. He asked, pursuant to Part 3 Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) that an offence of break, enter and steal be taken into account in relation to the first count on this indictment. 
     
      
    3 By s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, the first count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to Part 4 Division 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act a standard non-parole period of five years is prescribed for an offence falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness (further provided that there are not reasons for not imposing such a sentence). By s61L of the Crimes Act each of the two counts of indecent assault carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. By s61J(1) of the Crimes Act each of the three offences of aggravated sexual assault carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Each of these offences is subject to a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    4 The second indictment contained a single offence against s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, of supplying a prohibited drug, being cannabis. The applicant asked that, in respect of this offence, two offences of goods in custody and one of possession of prohibited drugs be taken into account, pursuant to Part 3 Division 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The offence on the indictment carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    5 As to the offences on the first indictment the applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 (aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, taking into account the Form 1 offence): imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of three years, commencing on 7 November 2003; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2 and 3 (indecent assault): imprisonment for a fixed term of two years, commencing 7 November 2005 (these sentences to be served concurrently with one another, partially accumulated upon the earlier imposed sentence); 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 (aggravated sexual assault): imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of five years, commencing on 7 November 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 5 and 6 (aggravated sexual assault): imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of six years, commencing 7 November 2009. 
        
       
      
    6 On the offence on the second indictment, and taking into account the Form 1 offences, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 7 November 2007. All relevant sentencing information can conveniently be set out in tabular form:

    7 The result was an effective overall sentence of imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. It is worth remarking that, while the sentences were generally partially accumulated, the sentence imposed in relation to the drug offence (the offence on the second indictment) was wholly accumulated upon the sentence imposed in respect of Counts 2 and 3 on the first indictment, and the sentence imposed in respect of Count 4 on the first indictment was wholly accumulated upon the sentence imposed in respect of the drug offence. Although all offences on the first indictment were committed as part of a single criminal enterprise, and the drug offence was entirely separate therefrom, and committed at a later time, the sentence for the drug offence, being specified to commence on 7 November 2007 and expire on 6 November 2008, sits in between the sentences for the first indictment offences. Why this was done is not apparent. 
     
      
       
      facts 
       
      
    8 The facts of the offences demonstrate beyond doubt that heavy sentences were called for. 
     
      
    9 All offences the subject of the first indictment were committed on 25 July 2003. On that date, at about 12.30 am, the applicant entered a private dwelling by removing a flyscreen from the bathroom window and entering through the window. The victim of the offences, a 55 year-old widow, was asleep in bed. She was alone in the premises, which were a home unit which she shared with her daughter. The victim was awakened by the movement or the noise and arose to investigate. She saw the applicant attempting to hide against a linen press. He rushed towards her and wrestled her to the floor. In doing so he caused her some injuries, including lacerations to her lower lip, inside her mouth, her nose and grazing to her face. The victim attempted to fight off the applicant but was unsuccessful. The applicant tied her hands behind her back with some elastic material. He forced her into her bedroom and placed her face down on the bed. He undressed and approached her. He pulled up her nightie and rolled her onto her back. He then spread her legs and rubbed his penis against the outside of her vagina and her anus. He began to kiss her while continuing to rub his penis around her vagina. He penetrated her vagina and had intercourse with her. He withdrew his penis from her vagina and positioned it against her mouth. He forced her to perform fellatio upon him. He then again had forced penile intercourse with her. 
     
      
    10 In all, the applicant was in the victim’s unit for approximately fifty minutes. On the agreed facts tendered to the sentencing judge, from time to time he left the bed and rummaged through her drawers and cupboards. 
     
      
    11 There were sounds of the victim’s daughter arriving home. The accused fled the premises. He took approximately $500 in cash and a key-card in the name of the victim. 
     
      
    12 These events gave rise to all of the charges on the first indictment. 
     
      
    13 During the afternoon of 7 August 2003 police learned that the applicant was in a room in a motel in Windsor. They attended, and gained entry. There they located the applicant in possession of more than 2.2 kilograms of cannabis, together with more than $5,000 in Australian currency. This gave rise to the charge on the second indictment, and constituted the offences taken into account. 
     
      
    14 The applicant was arrested and charged on 7 August 2003. He has remained in custody since that date. The matters on the first indictment were fixed for trial to commence on 9 August 2004. On that date the applicant entered pleas of guilty to all charges. It appears that the pleas of guilty were negotiated; the negotiations involved the withdrawal of one count that had originally been on the indictment. Accordingly, while it was not suggested that the pleas were entered at the earliest opportunity, they were not as belated as might otherwise appear. 
     
      
       
      subjective circumstances 
       
      
    15 The sentencing judge had available to him a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report. These showed that the applicant was born on 6 July 1965 and was 38 years of age at the time of those offences. He had had something of a disturbed background, and, prior to his arrest, he appeared to have no fixed place of residence. He spent some time with his mother, who provided him with a supportive environment. His father deserted before his birth and he had virtually no contact with him. He was physically and sexually abused by a step-brother. From a young age he moved between the care of his mother and his grandmother. He left school at a very early age, but is not illiterate. He has had intermittent employment since the age of 14, but has not been employed since 2002. He has a significant addiction history, having started to use cannabis at the age of 14, developed an addiction to heroin by the age of 22, having abused benzodiazepines, and, in close proximity to the offences, having developed an amphetamine habit. He was said to have little insight into his offending conduct. 
     
      
    16 The applicant has a very extensive criminal record. He has many entries for offences of dishonesty, dating back to 1983. In 1990 he was convicted of manslaughter and robbery with striking. These were by far the most serious offences on his record. 
     
      
    17 The psychiatrist who examined the applicant found evidence of auditory hallucinations during the time of the amphetamine use, and of unusual persecutory beliefs. He had some paranoia. These symptoms were active in the time prior to and immediately after the offences. The psychiatrist did not, however, diagnose any current psychosis. 
     
      
    18 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    19 Also before his Honour was a victim impact statement. While this is a moving and telling document, it does not, in the light of the nature of the offences, cause any surprise. The victim said that during the course of her ordeal she felt helpless and useless and feared for her daughter if she arrived home while the applicant was still in the premises. She was filled with fear, could not breathe and thought she would die. Thereafter she suffered the further ordeal of being taken to hospital, and waiting for a long time to be examined before she could have a shower. She was examined for any diseases that the applicant might have carried. For some time afterwards she slept in the same bed as her younger daughter with a night light, as she developed a fear of the dark. She used sleeping tablets. She was forced to resign from her job as a nurse as she was incapable of performing her functions and her concentration was poor. The event put any thoughts of a future relationship out of her mind. 
     
      
       
      the remarks on sentence 
       
      
    20 Delaney DCJ dealt carefully with the objective facts and the subjective circumstances, which it is unnecessary to repeat. 
     
      
       
      the grounds of appeal 
       
      
    21 Two grounds of appeal were pleaded. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing judge erred in the application of the principle of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence is (sic) manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    22 The argument that was put was, firstly, that the judge erred in the application of the principles stated in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; that the accumulation of the sentences resulted in a manifestly excessive overall sentence; and that insufficient weight was given to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. In this latter respect particular reference was made to the pleas of guilty, the applicant’s mental condition prior to and immediately after the offences, evidence that he had potential constructively to change his lifestyle, and the continued support of his mother. Counsel who appeared for the applicant presented a carefully prepared and concise argument in support, a principal focus of which lay in the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences the subject of the first indictment. He made two principal points. The first was, as has already been mentioned, that all offences were committed as part of the same criminal enterprise. He took issue with the finding that the episode continued over 50 minutes, and that the sexual assaults were interspersed by the applicant’s “rummaging” through the complainant’s drawers. (Some difficulty was created for counsel in this submission, having regard to an explicit assertion to that effect contained in the agreed statement of facts. It was, however, difficult to find support for it in the primary materials.) A more telling point concerned the “circumstances of aggravation”, which were an element of four of the offences. Counsel directed attention to the particularised indictment, which clearly shows that, in respect of each count, the circumstance of aggravation upon which the Crown relied was injury to the complainant’s face, mouth and head. It is obvious that caution needed (and needs) to be exercised to avoid duplication (or multiplication) of punishment for what is, in truth the same aggravating factor. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion this point is well made. While it cannot be said that any individual sentence was excessive, the overall sentence is certainly very high. 
     
      
    24 It is to be noted that no challenge is made to any of the individual sentences; it is only the result of the accumulation that is the subject of complaint. 
     
      
    25 On behalf of the Crown it was acknowledged that the circumstances posed a risk of double counting, and that there was a need to guard against falling into that error; but that, having regard to the plainly very serious nature of the offences, no lesser sentence than the total sentence actually imposed was called for. 
     
      
    26 It is well established that questions of accumulation or concurrence are very much within the discretion of a sentencing judge: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it has been shown that the extent of the accumulation of the sentences was excessive, and resulted in a manifestly excessive effective head sentence and non-parole period. It is probable that this came about as a consequence of reliance upon the same injuries to the complainant as aggravating four of the offences, but that does not need to be finally decided. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion, the ground has been made good. The error can be corrected by adjusting the starting dates of certain of the sentences, increasing the degree of concurrency and reducing the effect of the accumulation in some cases. 
     
      
    28 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) leave to appeal against each sentence granted; 
      
    (ii) appeals allowed; the applicant be re-sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Second indictment 
         (taking into account the additional offences) 
         
        Imprisonment for a fixed term of one year, to commence on 7 November 2003 and expire on 6 November 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        First indictment 
         
        Count 1 
        : (taking into account the offence of break, enter and steal) imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years, to commence on 7 November 2004 and expire on 6 November 2007, with a balance of term of four years, to expire on 6 November 2011; 
         
        Counts 2 and 3 
        : 
         
        imprisonment for a fixed term of two years, to commence on 7 May 2006 and expire on 6 May 2008; 
         
        Count 4 
        : 
         
        imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years, to commence on 7 May 2006, and expire on 6 May 2011, with a balance of term of four years, to expire on 6 May 2015; 
         
        Counts 5 and 6 
        : 
         
        imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years, to commence on 7 November 2007, and expire on 6 November 2013, with a balance of term of five years to expire on 6 November 2018. 
        
       
       
        
        The result is an overall head sentence of 15 years with an overall non-parole period of 10 years. The earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole is 6 November 2013.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: This is an appeal under s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“Appeal and Review Act”) by the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions, against orders made by a Magistrate at the Wollongong Local Court on 2 September 2005 dismissing proceedings against the Defendant, Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, in respect of five charges of not ensuring that a tag, label or attachment bearing a contract number or stock number was attached to an item taken in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business contrary to clause 18A(1) Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Regulation 2003 (“PSD Regulations”). 
     
      
    2 The Defendant was charged with 43 offences under the Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Act 1996 (“PSD Act”) and the PSD Regulations. The proceedings relating to these alleged offences were heard together before Mr CL Thompson, Magistrate, at the Wollongong Local Court over five sitting days in August and September 2005. Of the 43 charges, his Honour found 14 offences proved and the balance of the charges were dismissed. The present appeal relates only to the dismissal of five charges under Clause 18A PSD Regulations. 
     
      
    3 The proceedings were prosecuted in the Local Court by a police officer. In accordance with usual practice, the Director of Public Prosecutions has taken over the proceedings under s.9 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 and has instituted and is conducting the present appeal on behalf of the prosecution.  
     
      
    4 An appeal by a prosecutor under s.56(1)(c) Appeal and Review Act may be brought only on a ground that involves a question of law alone. In this case, the Plaintiff submits that error involving a question of law alone has been demonstrated. The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff’s appeal raises a question of fact, or a question of mixed fact and law, and that the appeal ought be dismissed for that reason. 
     
      
    5 Further, the Defendant has filed a Notice of Contention pursuant to Part 51B r 18 Supreme Court Rules asserting that the decision of the Local Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by the learned Magistrate.  
     
      
       
      Section 21 PSD Act and Clause 18A PSD Regulations 
       
      
    6 It is appropriate to set out in their entirety s.21 PSD Act and clause 18A PSD Regulations. It is the proper construction of these provisions which lies at the heart of this appeal. 
     
      
    7 Section 21 PSD Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “21  
        Retention of goods 
         
         
        (1) A licensee: 
         
         
          
          (a) must keep all second-hand goods purchased or received in the course of the licensed business for a period of 14 days on premises nominated or otherwise notified under section 12 or 12A as business premises or at such other places as may be determined by or in accordance with the regulations, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) must not alter the form of the goods or dispose of them in any way, or allow them to be redeemed or part with possession of them, during that period. 
           
          
         
        This subsection does not apply to such goods, or in such circumstances, as the regulations may prescribe. 
         
         
        (1A) The period of 14 days commences with the day on which the purchase or receipt was recorded by the licensee. 
         
         
        (2) An authorised officer who has reasonable grounds to suspect that goods in the possession of a licensee have been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained may, by a notice specifying the goods, prohibit the licensee from altering the form of the goods or disposing of them in any way, or allowing them to be redeemed, or parting with possession of them, for a period of 56 days after service of the notice. 
         
         
        (3) A notice under subsection (2) may be reissued once for a further period of 56 days commencing on the expiry of the first notice. 
         
         
        (4) A licensee must comply with this section and with any notice under this section, and must see to it that no employee of the business does what this section or such a notice prohibits the licensee from doing. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.” 
         
        
       
      
    8 Clause 18A PSD Regulations provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “18A  
        Contract or stock number to be reproduced on tag, label or other attachment 
         
         
        (1) A licensee must ensure that: 
         
         
          
          (a) the contract number, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a stock number, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           for each item taken in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business is reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment to the item. 
          
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. 
         
         
         
        (2) In this clause: 
         
         
          
          contract number 
           for an item is the number referred to in clause 13 (1) (c) or (2) (c) in relation to the item. 
          
         
         
          
          stock number 
           for an item is a number that: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) is uniquely assigned by the licensee to distinguish the item from any other item held by the licensee in the course of the licensee’s business, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) is the same as or different from the contract number for the item, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) is recorded electronically and in paper form, and 
          
         
         
          
          (d) is linked to the contract number for the item in the electronic and paper record.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The Local Court Proceedings 
       
      
    9 The evidence for the prosecution in the Local Court proceedings comprised statements and documents only. No prosecution witness gave oral evidence or was required for cross-examination. The Defendant called oral evidence which touched upon the five charges which are the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
    10 The prosecution evidence revealed the following facts: 
     
      
       
      (a) The Defendant is a corporation that operates a pawnbroking and second-hand dealer’s business through four stores in the Wollongong and Illawarra region. 
       
       
      (b) On Tuesday, 30 November 2004, Senior Constable Mair and other police attended the Defendant’s business premises, trading as Cash-afx, at 177 Keira Street, Wollongong. The purpose of the visit to the premises was to conduct a business inspection during which items were randomly selected and inspected. 
       
       
      (c) Police selected and inspected a blue  
      “Gemini” 
       bicycle which did not have any label attached to it. Senior Constable Mair said to the business manager, Mr Stan Hondroudakis,  
      “What can you tell me about this bicycle?” 
      . Mr Hondroudakis said,  
      “It would be a buy. It’s too full upstairs” 
      . Senior Constable Mair said,  
      “Whether it is a buy or a loan it is still required to have a label attached” 
      . Senior Constable Mair took three photographs of the bicycle. 
       
       
      (d) Police went upstairs to check on the purchased items in the 14-day holding area (set aside for the purposes of s.21(1)(a) PSD Act). In her official police notebook, Constable Tonks recorded details of items which bore no label or tag to identify the item or contract number for the item. These items were: a Sony Compact disc player, a Canon printer, a Panasonic cordless phone and a Squire Strat guitar. Photographs were taken of the items. The business owner, Mr Michael O’Shea, who was a director of the Defendant, was requested by police to provide the  
      “buy” 
       documents (tax invoices) relating to each of these items. 
       
       
      (e) On Wednesday, 8 December 2004, Senior Constable Mair returned to the premises and handed infringement notices to Mr O’Shea relating, relevantly, to the five items the subject of these proceedings, being the items referred to in paragraph 13(c) and (d) above. 
       
      
    11 It was accepted that the Defendant was required to hold a licence under the PSD Act. Such licence was applied for and the Defendant had been granted a licence to trade in second-hand goods and as a pawnbroker, thereby permitting the Defendant to buy second-hand goods, and to retain them, and also to lend money against items pledged to the Defendant (T83). 
     
      
    12 At the conclusion of the prosecution case, his Honour held that there was a prima facie case and evidence was called in the defence case. Mr O’Shea, one of the two directors and shareholders of the Defendant company, gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) when goods are purchased, the vendor enters the  
      “buyers room” 
       with the item, a price is negotiated, and a contract document is created on the computer before the money is handed over and the docket signed (T205.28); 
       
       
      (b) electronic records of the contract documents are sent to the Commissioner of Police either daily or every three days (T205.36); 
       
       
      (c) items that have been purchased as second-hand goods, not loaned items, are placed in the 14-day holding area of the premises in which there are 14 shelves; on the 15th day, the items are removed to be made ready for sale. The items are cleaned and repaired (if necessary) and then placed on the floor for sale (T203.29); 
       
       
      (d) on the 15th day or thereafter, a label is attached to the items (T206.4); 
       
       
      (e) the label is created generally at the end of the day on which the item has been purchased, or  
      “first thing the next morning” 
       after purchase (206.7); 
       
       
      (f) the labels are then generally placed in a plastic sleeve and then placed on a shelf underneath the shelves where the  
      “buys” 
       are (T206.10); 
       
       
      (g) the items were not labelled either when the contract was created or within the 14-day holding period because at the time of the purchase of the business, it was the general practice of the previous franchise owners not to label the good within that 14-day period and Mr O’Shea believed that s.21 PSD Act prevented the alteration of the form of the goods (T206.20); 
       
       
      (h) as the labels have to be of a size sufficient to accommodate the information required by the legislation, the labels could cause problems with small items such as watches, mobile phones, MP3 players, interactive console games (such as Nintendo) and Sony memory cards (T206.33); 
       
       
      (i) a label (bearing a barcode, a contract number, description and the outlet that purchased the goods) when placed on a memory card for a Sony Playstation 2 covers much of the item (T209.43-210); 
       
       
      (j) Mr O’Shea produced to the Court four tax invoices relating to the purchase of four of the subject items - the Sony Compact Disc Player, Canon Printer, Squire Strat electric guitar and Panasonic cordless phone (T212-213); 
       
       
      (k) the tax invoice for the Gemini mountain bicycle was tendered in the defence case (T238); 
       
       
      (l) the method used to identify items when they were placed on the retail floor was to print out a sticker and place it on the item (T265.17). 
       
      
    13 The evidence revealed that the Gemini mountain bicycle and the Canon Printer had been purchased by the Defendant on 19 November 2004, the Panasonic cordless phone and Squire Strat electric guitar had been purchased on 23 November 2004 and the Sony Compact Disc Player on 24 November 2004. Accordingly, the five items had been possessed by the Defendant for between six and 11 days at the time of the police inspection on 30 November 2004 which gave rise to the subject charges. No tag or label had been affixed to the items, or any of them, in this period. 
     
      
    14 The defence case closed on 2 September 2005. There was no case in reply. The prosecutor addressed his Honour with respect to all the charges before the Court (T267-273) and, in particular, with respect to the clause 18A charges (T270.21-271.16). Counsel for the Defendant handed up written submissions and addressed the learned Magistrate (T274-276). 
     
      
       
      The Local Court Decision 
       
      
    15 Before turning to his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the subject charges, it is appropriate to bear in mind that his Honour’s reasons constitute an unedited and unpunctuated record of ex tempore remarks in a busy Magistrate’s Court: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 479A, 485C-D. Such a judgment should not be picked over and appropriate allowance should be given to the pressures under which Magistrates are placed by the volume of cases coming before them: Neighbourhood Association DP295386 v Forgeron (2005) NSWCA 150 at paragraph 15; Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 573 at 583 (paragraph 36). That said, there are some features of this case which call for further comment. 
     
      
    16 His Honour had before him some 43 charges which fell for determination. It appears that, following the evidence, his Honour moved to determine the charges in groups. His Honour did not deliver a discrete judgment containing reasons for dismissing the five charges which are the subject of the present appeal. There is no ground of appeal alleging error of law on the part of the learned Magistrate in failing to give reasons as required by law for dismissing the charges. Nevertheless, the manner in which his Honour determined these charges and explained his reasoning for that course, has given rise to an additional debate in this Court as to the precise reasons for dismissing the charges.  
     
      
    17 In Adecco v Gemvale Constructions Pty Limited [2004] NSWCA 449, Santow JA (Mason P and Sheller JA agreeing) said at paragraph 41: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the duty to give reasons is a necessary incident of the judicial process. Without adequate reasons, justice has not been seen to be done, so that failure to give adequate reasons may be an error of law:  
        Pettitt v Dunkley 
         (1971) 1 NSWLR 376;  
        Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited 
         (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 278-279 per McHugh JA;  
        Mifsud v Campbell 
         (1991) 21 NSWLR 725;  
        Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW 
         (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. But the duty does not require the trial judge to spell out in minute detail every step in the reasoning process or refer to every single piece of evidence. It is sufficient if the reasons adequately reveal the basis of the decision, expressing the specific findings that are critical to the determination of the proceedings.”  
        
       
      
    18 One of the conventional functions of the requirement to give reasons is that a statement of reasons may be necessary to enable a party to exercise a right of appeal or such other rights as the party may have to contest the decision: Pettitt v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376, 387, 388; Donges v Ratcliffe (1975) 1 NSWLR 501 at 507; Housing Commission of NSW v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited (1983) 3 NSWLR 378 at 386. The defendant and the prosecutor have a statutory right of appeal to this Court under the Appeal and Review Act arising from the determination of criminal proceedings in the Local Court.  
     
      
    19 It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a magistrate’s reasons for determination: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at paragraph 11; R v Thompson (2005) 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-5 (paragraph 32). The provision of concise reasons as required by law will avoid this circumstance occurring. It is necessary that magistrates keep in mind the obligation to provide reasons when determining summary proceedings under s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    20 Having heard submissions from the prosecutor, the learned Magistrate received submissions, written and oral, from Mr Kell for the then Defendant. To set his Honour’s statements in context, it is appropriate to pick up the following extract from the transcript (T274.8-275.17): 
     
      
       
        
        “KELL: Your Honour can I just address the regulation 18A ones first separately which is the written note. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You want the written note, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: So that your Honour deals with the charges on the schedule which are numbered 24, 34, 37 -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Let me just - 24 -- 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: 34. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 34. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: 37, 39 through to 41 and also number 33. That’s slightly different. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Let me put this to you, perhaps more to the prosecution you’ve had a chance of reading those submissions Sergeant. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Yes well I think …  
        (not transcribable) 
         ... answers to those anyway. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ve looked at it extremely carefully, I mean I must accept that regulation 18A doesn’t impose a time limitation. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The question is whether under those circumstances what time limitation do apply. The other thing that occurs to me in relation to that, he said it does make specific reference to items taken or during the course of a business - of the licensee’s business. Part of the business is to sell goods once that’s taken. If he’s prohibited by section 21 from in fact selling them then he wouldn’t be during his normal course of business, I would have thought, and the obligation under that is to tag them or label them during the course of his business. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: Which is a subsidiary, it’s not using section 21 on a direct clash. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Section 21 is quite specific, they must not, it’s mandatory, they cannot dispose of those goods, if so it limits his business at that particular point of time, it doesn’t become his ordinary course of business as far as I’m concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: And for that reason if he forms a time requirement. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now the only thing is and in relation to each of those particular matters it is suggested, there’s just so much evidence and they all fall within the 14 day period. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: Subject to charge number 33. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes that was the Chinese -- 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: China statue but all the others yes, 14 days and the invoices. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You agree with that Sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I’m prepared to uphold that submission.” 
        
       
      
    21 It appears, from what occurred later, that his Honour at this point dismissed the five charges which are the subject of this appeal. Submissions proceeded with respect to other charges and his Honour found a number of other offences proved (T284-285). His Honour enquired as to whether all matters had been disposed of and the following exchange is recorded in the transcript (T285.12): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: In that matter I also find that offence proven. Is that all matters now? 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: I think so your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour’s said things about the 18A matters, so all the 18A matters are they then 43 the Chinese statue? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, no the Chinese statue I found proven. The others were dismissed. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: On the basis that -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well on the basis that the time under regulation 18A is not stated and refers to during the course of business - I would take that to mean during the course of the normal business. The fourteen day period under section 21 as I understand it prohibits the selling or the putting up for sale of any item. It would seem to me that in the absence of any time, whether that’s an error in the drafting or not you know I’d take the argument Mr Kell put up, what time do I apply. Do I use the term fair and reasonable time? If I was not to consider the fourteen day period just exactly what time do I apply? I would think that that would be an appropriate time to apply and if it was a fair and reasonable time certainly being prohibited from going about the normal course of business for fourteen days and holding them, I believe, was such that I am satisfied that I should not have found those offences proven and I have already made that ruling. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Yes I know you’ve already made a decision. I’m not grappling with your Honour’s decision I was just clarifying. 
        
       
       
        
        KELL: I think that is all of the -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s all the matters, yes thank you Mr Kell. You wish to make submissions now in relation to the sentence on the matters which I have found the offences proven.” 
        
       
      
    22 I approach the resolution of the matters raised in this appeal upon the basis that his Honour’s reasons for dismissing the five subject charges are contained in his comments in the course of Mr Kell’s submissions (when it appears that the decision to dismiss the charges was actually made) and at a later time when, following an enquiry by the prosecutor, his Honour provided a further explanation for the course taken in dismissing these charges. 
     
      
       
      The Plaintiff’s Submissions 
       
      
    23 Ms Woodburne, for the Plaintiff, submits that the appeal raises grounds that involve a question of law alone and, accordingly, that it is incorrect to contend that the appeal raises a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law.  
     
      
    24 The Plaintiff submits that the learned Magistrate erred in law in dismissing the five clause 18A offences and, in particular, made material errors of law: 
     
      
       
      (a) in finding that the 14-day period during which items are retained pursuant to s.21(1)(a) PSD Act does not constitute  
      “the course of the licensee’s business” 
       for the purposes of clause 18A PSD Regulations; 
       
       
      (b) in determining (as far as it can be ascertained from his Honour’s ruling) that in the absence of any specified time requirement in clause 18A, an appropriate time to apply to the obligation to label or tag the items is 14 days, being 14 days in the course of the licensee’s (ordinary) business (that is, not including the 14-day holding period). 
       
      
    25 Ms Woodburne submits that the learned Magistrate held that the words “the course of the licensee’s business” should be taken to mean “the normal course of the licensee’s business” which, his Honour said, was to sell goods. Since s.21 PSD Act prohibited the licensee from selling goods for a period of 14 days, that period did not constitute the “normal” course of business and there was no obligation to tag or label the goods during that time.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that this reasoning revealed error of law in a number of respects. Firstly, in determining what was “the course of the licensee’s business”, the Magistrate erroneously implied the words “ordinary” or “normal” into the legislation and then used these words to restrict unjustifiably the course of the licensee’s business to the conduct of selling the goods. In reading the words “ordinary” or “normal” into the legislation, the Plaintiff submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the other words of the section, namely “items taken in trade” which made patently clear that clause 18A applied to the very goods the subject of the proceedings because they were “items taken in trade … during the course of the licensee’s business”. Had his Honour had regard to the words “taken in trade”, it would have been clear that the course of the licensee’s business could not be confined to the act or process of selling the goods, but rather included the whole course of the licensee’s business, including the taking of goods in trade, the holding of those goods for 14 days and the selling of the goods, which business was regulated by the PSD Act and the PSD Regulations.  
     
      
    27 The Plaintiff submits that, the goods having been “taken in trade … in the course of the licensee’s business”, the Defendant was required by clause 18A(1) to ensure that each item had its contract/stock number reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment to the item. 
     
      
    28 The Plaintiff submits that the learned Magistrate’s approach in this case was to exclude effectively the 14-day holding period from the time for compliance with clause 18A on the basis that “the obligation … is to tag them or label them during the course of his business” (T274.45), meaning the “ordinary” or “normal” course of the business. The Plaintiff submits that this approach involved a misinterpretation of clause 18A(1) leading to it being read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a licensee must ensure that the contract number or stock number for each item taken in trade … is reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment to the item during the ordinary course of the licensee’s business” 
        
       
       
      instead of: 
       
       
        
        “… a licensee must ensure that the contract number or stock number for each item taken in trade … during the course of the licensee’s business is reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment to the item.” 
        
       
      
    29 The Plaintiff submits that the Magistrate has erred in law in concluding that the obligation to label or tag the items arises only after the 14-day holding period and when the items become available for sale. In any event, the Plaintiff submits that there was no warrant for implying a period of no less than 14 days as the time in which the tag or label is to be attached to the item. 
     
      
    30 The undisputed evidence in this case was that the labels for the five relevant items had been prepared either on the day of purchase or the morning after, yet the Defendant refrained deliberately from attaching those labels to the items during the 14-day holding period.  
     
      
    31 Even if the Court was prepared to imply that the obligation to tag or label the goods should be done within a reasonable time, the Plaintiff submits that a reasonable time could not extend beyond the time when the goods were taken in trade and when the records relating to the purchase of the items were completed so that, on any view, that time had expired once the labels were prepared but then deliberately not attached. By 30 November 2004, when inspected by police, the items had remained untagged for about six days (in the case of the Sony Compact Disc Player), seven days (in the case of the Panasonic cordless phone and Squire Strat electric guitar) and 11 days (in the case of the Canon Printer and Gemini mountain bicycle).  
     
      
    32 The Plaintiff submits that error of law has been demonstrated and that the matter ought be remitted to the Local Court to be heard and determined according to law. 
     
      
       
      The Defendant’s Submissions 
       
      
    33 Mr Kell, for the Defendant, submits that the appeal should be dismissed at the threshold as it raised a question of fact or, at most, a question of mixed fact and law and not a question of law alone. It was emphasised that s.56(1)(c) Appeal and Review Act limited the prosecutor’s right of appeal to a ground that involves a question of law alone.  
     
      
    34 The Defendant submits that, where a statutory provision does not specify a time period for the doing of a particular act, the courts will imply a requirement that the Act be done within a reasonable period: R v Skurray (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) NSW 1; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Ganke (1975) 1 NSWLR 252; New South Wales Grains Board v Davis (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 July 1997, BC9703434); Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 5th edn, 2001, paragraph [6.50]. 
     
      
    35 The Defendant submits that clause 18A contains no specific time requirement as to when the tag or label is to be attached to the item. Clause 18A was contrasted with s.28(1) PSD Act which requires a pledge contract record to be made “at the time possession of goods is taken under an agreement by which the goods are pawned”. The Defendant submits that a reasonable time requirement should be implied into clause 18A PSD Regulations. It is submitted that the principal question arising in the appeal relates to whether the Defendant had failed to affix labels to the items within a reasonable time. The Defendant submits that this is a question of fact or, at most, a question of mixed fact and law. It is submitted that a question of law alone is not raised. The Defendant relies upon R v Skurray at 8; Neal v Commissioner for Superannuation (1987) 76 ALR 281 at 290-291; New South Wales Grains Board v Davis at 5-6; Harts Australia Limited v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (2002) 117 FCR 358 at 394-395 (paragraph 142). 
     
      
    36 The Defendant submits that the question in this case is whether the Defendant had affixed the tags or labels within a reasonable time implied into clause 18A and that this raises a question of fact. It is submitted that determination of the matters which could be taken into account in considering whether the Defendant had affixed the labels within a reasonable time (including, for example, the factual circumstance that items could not be disposed of by the Defendant within an initial 14-day period) raised, at most, a question of mixed fact and law. In either case, the Defendant submits that a question of law alone is not raised and that the appeal should he dismissed.  
     
      
    37 The Defendant submits that it is not to the point that an appellate court may be inclined to disagree, even strongly, with the approach taken by the learned Magistrate in terms of a finding of a question of fact or of mixed fact and law. There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact: Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia (1986-1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77.  
     
      
       
      The Defendant’s Notice of Contention 
       
      
    38 Before turning to resolve the competing submissions, it is appropriate to set out the arguments arising from the Defendant’s Notice of Contention. There is some overlap between the various arguments, all of which touch upon, in one way or another, the proper construction of clause 18A PSD Regulations. 
     
      
       
      The Defendant’s Submissions on the Notice of Contention 
       
      
    39 The Defendant advanced four alternative contentions as to why the appeal should be dismissed in any event. 
     
      
    40 Firstly, the Defendant contends that s.21 informs the content of the requirement of a reasonable period of time that is necessarily implied into clause 18A PSD Regulations. Section 21 dictates that, during the initial 14-day period, the goods cannot be disposed of or offered for sale by the Defendant and the form of the goods cannot be altered in any way. During this period, the item has already been the subject of a contract record created at the time of acquisition (s.16 PSD Act; clause 13 PSD Regulations). The licensee is required to produce the contract on demand to an authorised police officer (s.17) and an electronic version of the record is required to be sent to the Commissioner of Police within three days (clause 16 PSD Regulations). In these circumstances, the Defendant contends that the requirement of a reasonable time to affix the label extends to the 14-day period although the relevant time periods before the penalty notices were issued were in fact less than 14 days, namely between six and 11 days, in this case. 
     
      
    41 Secondly, the Defendant contends that, in circumstances where the licensee cannot dispose of or display the goods for sale during the 14-day period, that period does not form part of the course of the licensee’s business within clause 18A so that there is no contravention of clause 18A where a tag or label is not affixed until after the 14-day period.  
     
      
    42 Thirdly, the Defendant submits that s.21(1)(b) PSD Act provides that within the 14-day holding period the licensee “must not alter the form of the goods … in any way”. The Defendant submits that the act of attaching a sticker label to an item does “alter” the form of the goods. This is particularly so in the case of many small items that are routinely obtained by a pawnbroker where the attachment of a label will obscure most of the product. The Defendant submits that the word “alter” in s.21(1)(b) is a word of wide import, particularly when coupled with the term “in any way”. It is submitted that the term comfortably encompasses the attachment of an obtrusive sticker label that may be difficult to remove. 
     
      
    43 The Defendant submits that s.21 PSD Act ought have primacy over clause 18A PSD Regulations. The obligation not to alter the item under s.21 must prevail over the obligation (if it exists) to affix a tag or label to the item under clause 18A. 
     
      
    44 Fourthly, the Defendant submits that clause 18A does not require that the tag or label be affixed to the relevant item and that the Defendant satisfied the requirements of the provision in respect of each of the five matters charged. There was no issue that the Defendant did in fact create tags for the five products within a short period of time. The five tags so created had not been affixed to the items at the time of the police audit, but were positioned relatively close by the items. The Defendant submits that this satisfied the requirements of Clause 18A.  
     
      
    45 In summary, the Defendant submits that the Magistrate’s decision to dismiss the five charges under clause 18A ought be upheld on one or other of the bases advanced by the Defendant in this Court. 
     
      
       
      The Plaintiff’s Response 
       
      
    46 With respect to the arguments advanced in the Notice of Contention, the Plaintiff submits that clause 18A PSD Regulations, properly construed, requires that a tag or label be physically affixed to the relevant item. It is submitted that the grammatical or literal meaning of clause 18A is clear and that a construction flowing from the ordinary meaning of the words serves to promote the purpose or object underlying the statutory provision: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987. The extrinsic material comprising the Second Reading speeches tends to confirm that the meaning of clause 18A is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision: s.34(1)(a), (2)(f) Interpretation Act 1987. 
     
      
    47 In the course of the Second Reading Speech with respect to the Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Bill 1996, the Minister for Fair Trading identified the purpose of the legislation in the following terms (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 24 April 1996, page 438): 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of this bill is to establish a new regulatory scheme for pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers. The scheme involves streamlined licensing of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers who deal in high-risk-of-theft goods. It also requires licensees to observe certain minimum standards of conduct, including record keeping.” 
        
       
      
    48 When introducing the Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Amendment Bill 2002 (which led to the enactment of the PSD Regulations 2003), the Minister for Fair Trading reiterated that the main purpose of the PSD Act was to restrict the trade in stolen goods. He said (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 30 October 2002, page 6182): 
     
      
       
        
        “This is done by regulating the industry through an occupational licensing regime and having evidence of identity and record-keeping requirements. The Act also aims to constrain the exercise of market power in respect of the provision of pawn broking services and to provide a mechanism to facilitate the return of stolen property to rightful owners quickly and equitably.” 
        
       
       
      Towards the end of the second reading speech, the Minister said: 
       
       
        
        “This bill enhances the existing pawnbroking and second-hand dealer licensing regime. It ensures that the objectives of the legislation - to restrict the trade in stolen goods, to provide consumer protection to those who use pawnbroking services and to provide a mechanism to facilitate the return of stolen property to rightful owners quickly and equitably - continue to be met in the most efficient and effective way.” 
        
       
      
    49 The Plaintiff points to the thorough and far-reaching statutory scheme enacted by the PSD Act and Regulations. The Act is an “Act to provide for the licensing and regulation of pawnbrokers and dealers in certain classes of secondhand goods”. Part 2 of the Act provides for the licensing of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers. Part 3 provides for the regulation of licensed businesses. Section 43 makes provision for regulations to be made for the purposes of the Act. In particular, regulations made be made for or with respect to the carrying on of a business as a second-hand dealer or pawnbroker or both: s.43(c1) PSD Act. A regulation may create an offence punishable by a penalty not exceeding 20 penalty units: s.43(2) PSD Act. 
     
      
    50 The Plaintiff submits that it is apparent that the PSD Act and Regulations established a comprehensive scheme of licensing and regulation of the business of pawnbrokers and dealers in second-hand goods. The statutory scheme includes a requirement that business and storage premises be nominated (s.12), that the licensee must obtain documentary evidence of the seller’s identify before accepting goods offered for sale and the licensee must not accept any goods offered for sale where the licensee believes the goods are not the property of the seller or that the seller is not authorised to sell them (s.15). A licensee must keep records in the manner and containing the particulars prescribed by the Regulations, of all transactions for the acquisition and disposal of second-hand goods (s.16). An authorised officer may require the production of such records (s.17), take temporary possession of any record for the purpose of making copies or notes of it (s.18) and may enter any business or storage premises and inspect goods (s.20). 
     
      
    51 Part 3 of the PSD Regulations makes detailed provision with respect to records (see, in particular, clauses 11, 13(2) and 16 PSD Regulations). 
     
      
    52 The Plaintiff submits that the extent to which the business of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers is regulated, particularly as to licensing and record keeping, indicates that the purpose of the PSD Act and Regulations is to regulate, in the public interest, the business of those who deal in high-risk-of-theft goods by requiring licensees to observe certain minimum standards of conduct, including record keeping.  
     
      
    53 Insofar as the Defendant’s Notice of Contention asserts that it had satisfied the requirements of clause 18A, the Plaintiff submits that this contention ought be rejected. The Plaintiff submits that the obligation under clause 18A(1) was not satisfied by the mere creation of a record pertaining to the acquisition of the goods. Nor was the obligation under that clause satisfied by the provision, by electronic means, of the record relating to the acquisition of the goods to the Commissioner of Police. Nor was that obligation satisfied by the production to police of records relating to the purchase at the time of inspection or by the production to police of the labels which had been prepared for, but not affixed to, the items. The Plaintiff emphasises that the Defendant created labels to be affixed to the items but had not done so for several days before the police inspection. Although the Defendant may have satisfied other requirements of the PSD Act and Regulations, the Plaintiff submits that there was a clear failure to comply with the requirements of clause 18A with respect to each of the five items.  
     
      
    54 The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant’s argument based upon a desire not to “alter” the items by affixing labels to them does not provide a basis upon which the learned Magistrate’s orders may be upheld. In effect, the Plaintiff submits that the Defendant cannot avoid the obligation to comply with clause 18A by the selection of a type of a tag or label, in the form of a sticker, which may adhere to and in some way obstruct parts of an item. Clause 18A does not require the application of a sticker. In any event, the five items which are the subject of this appeal were not small. 
     
      
    55 The Plaintiff submits that s.21 PSD Act is directed to the holding of the goods for a period of time during which the goods cannot be altered or disposed of in a manner which would interfere with the investigation of or restoration of stolen goods. The tagging or labelling of goods, even if done by way of a sticker, is not something which adversely affects either the investigation of or restoration of the goods.  
     
      
    56 The Plaintiff submits that the tagging or labelling of the goods facilitates the investigation and identification process which is fundamental to the statutory scheme contained in the PSD Act and Regulations. A construction of clause 18A that requires the affixing of the tag or label to the item at the time of purchase promotes the underlying purpose or object of the Act. It may be that a licensee will accumulate a large number of items in the course of the licensee’s business. A practice of placing the tag or label near, but not attached to, the item runs the risk that items and labels will become confused. This would not serve to promote the purpose or object of the statutory provisions in question. A construction of clause 18A which requires the affixing of the tag or label to the item would, on the other hand, serve that purpose. 
     
      
    57 The Plaintiff submits that none of the arguments advanced by the Defendant in its Notice of Contention ought lead to the affirming of the Local Court’s decision to dismiss the five charges. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of Competing Submissions 
       
      
    58 Section 56(1)(c) Appeal and Review Act confines a prosecutor who appeals to the Supreme Court against an order of acquittal in summary criminal proceedings to a ground that involves a question of law alone. There is no universally applicable test for distinguishing questions of law from questions of fact: Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd (1995) 186 CLR 389 at 394; Sood v R [2006] NSWCCA 114 at paragraph 30. 
     
      
    59 The formulation “question of law” employs general words capable of application at different levels of generality: Attorney General for NSW v X (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 at 660 (paragraph 25). The expression “question of law” is wider than “error of law”: Attorney General for NSW v X at 677 (paragraph 124).  
     
      
    60 A mixed question of fact and law does not fall within the description of “question of law alone”: Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 287, 314; Attorney General for NSW v X at 663 (paragraph 44).  
     
      
    61 That an appeal to this Court by a prosecutor from an acquittal in summary criminal proceedings is confined to a question of law alone is not surprising. Such an appeal constitutes a statutory exception to the rule against double jeopardy: Davern v Messel (1983-1984) 155 CLR 21 at 30.  
     
      
    62 However, a decision of a court of summary jurisdiction acquitting a defendant has never been regarded with the same sanctity as the verdict of a jury and the consistent trend of legislation, both in England and Australia, has been towards allowing the prosecution to appeal against an order of a Magistrate dismissing a charge and empowering the Supreme Court on appeal to quash the order: Davern v Messel at 37-38. 
     
      
    63 To assist a conclusion as to whether this appeal involves a ground which raises a question of law alone, it is necessary to consider the proper construction of clause 18A PSD Regulations. The contemporary approach to statutory interpretation is literal but not literalistic and requires words to be construed in their total context: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Clark (2003) 57 NSWLR 113 at 141 (paragraph 115). In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at 381 [69] and 384 [78] (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[69] The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. The meaning of the provision must be determined ‘by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole’. In  
        Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos 
         (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397, Dixon CJ pointed out that ‘the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed’. Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed. 
         
         
         … 
         
         
        [78] … the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning.” 
        
       
      
    64 The PSD Act is to be given a purposive construction: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987; Palgo Holdings Pty Limited v Gowans (2005) 221 CLR 249 at 262 [28].  
     
      
    65 Clause 18A(1) provides that a licensee must “ensure” that certain action is taken. According to the Macquarie Dictionary, the verb “ensure” means: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. To secure, or bring surely, as to a person: this letter will ensure you a hearing. 
         
         
        2. To make sure or certain to come, occur, etc: measures to ensure the success of an undertaking. 
         
         
        3. To make secure or safe, as from harm.” 
        
       
       
      The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary includes in the definition of  
      “ensure” 
       the terms  
      “to warrant” 
       and  
      “to guarantee” 
      .  
       
      
    66 In a different statutory context, it has been held that the requirement to ensure that action is taken involves application of the ordinary meaning of the word “ensure”, being guaranteeing, securing or making certain that action is taken: Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd v Callaghan (1985) 11 IR 467 at 470; McMillan Britton and Kell Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Blake) (1999) 89 IR 464 at 480. In my view, the requirement in clause 18A that the licensee “ensure” that action is taken places a heavy onus on the licensee to make sure that such action is taken.  
     
      
       
      What Action Is Required of the Licensee under Clause 18A 
      ?  
       
      
    67 To comply with clause 18A(1), a licensee must ensure that a contract or stock number for each item taken in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business is reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment to the item. The Macquarie Dictionary includes the following definition of the noun “tag” which appears apt to this case: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A piece or strip of strong paper, leather, or the like, for attaching by one end to something as a mark or label. …” 
        
       
       
      In the same Dictionary, the noun  
      “label” 
       contains the following presently relevant definition: 
       
       
        
        “1. A slip of paper or other material for affixing to something to indicate its nature, ownership, destination, etc. …” 
        
       
       
      The noun  
      “attachment” 
       is relevantly defined as follows in the Macquarie Dictionary: 
       
       
        
        “1. …  
         
         
        2. The state of being attached. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        4. That which attaches; a fastening or tie: the attachments of a pair of skis or of a harness. 
         
         
        5. An adjunct or supplementary device: attachments to a reaping machine. …” 
        
       
      
    68 In my view, the obligation upon a licensee under clause 18A(1) is to ensure that the contract or stock number is reproduced on a tag, label or other attachment which is physically attached to the item. The ordinary meaning of “tag” and “label” involves a thing prepared for the purpose of affixing it to an object. The requirement under clause 18A is not satisfied by the location of a tag or label bearing the relevant number in the vicinity of, but not attached to, the item. 
     
      
       
      When Does the Licensee’s Obligation to Ensure that a Tag or Label is Affixed to the Item Arise 
      ? 
       
      
    69 Clause 18A(1) does not provide expressly that the tag or label is to be attached to the item at the time when the licensee takes in trade or pawn the item during the course of the licensee’s business. In construing clause 18A, it is appropriate to have regard to statutory context. Clause 18A lies within an elaborate scheme contained in the PSD Act and Regulations which is designed to regulate, in the public interest, the business of those who deal in high-risk-of-theft goods by requiring licensees to observe certain minimum standards of conduct, including record keeping. 
     
      
    70 Clause 18A requires the physical attachment to an item of a tag or label containing the relevant contract or stock number. The purpose of such a requirement seems clear enough. Compliance with this requirement will allow immediate inspection by a police officer or other authorised person (s.3(1) PSD Act) with the view to identifying and confirming the item and its origins. The item and the tag or label will be linked physically. The authorised person will be able, without further inquiry, to inspect the item and its tag or label. This process serves to promote the purpose of clause 18A viewed in its statutory context.  
     
      
    71 A “contract number” or “stock number”, as defined in clause 18A(2), is to be allocated to the item promptly by the licensee who takes an item in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business. A licensee must ensure that a contract or stock number for each item so taken is reproduced on a tag or label which is physically attached to the item.  
     
      
    72 As a matter of statutory construction, there appears to be little scope for implying that a period ought be allowed for this to be done extending beyond the creation of the contract or stock number and the immediate creation of a label or tag to be affixed to the item. Compliance with clause 18A requires the prompt affixing of the tag or label to the item. 
     
      
    73 The requirement imports an element of immediacy. The licensee is to ensure that such action is taken promptly. It is not consistent with the words of clause 18A, viewed in its statutory context, that action required under the clause might be delayed for reasons of convenience to the licensee. 
     
      
    74 The mandatory terms of clause 18A operate at all times when a licensee takes an item in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business. Clause 18A is not a provision whereby an obligation to act in a particular way is only triggered by a demand or request being made, for example, for production of documents or information. There is an on-going obligation on a licensee to ensure that a contract or stock number for each item taken in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business is reproduced on a tag or label which is then physically attached to the item. The legislative scheme contained in the PSD Act and Regulations requires the creation of such a number and reproduction of it on a tag or label which is then affixed physically to the item at or very soon after the time when the item is taken in trade or pawn. 
     
      
    75 It is erroneous to conclude, as the learned Magistrate has done, that the phrase “during the course of the licensee’s business” does not extend to include the 14-day holding period when the item cannot be sold under s.21 PSD Act. The item in question is taken by the licensee in trade or pawn when the licensee receives the item in the course of the licensee’s business. The item must be stored in a specified part of the licensee’s business premises to comply with s.21(1)(a) PSD Act. Having taken the item in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business, the licensee continues to retain the item during the course of the licensee’s business during the 14-day holding period. It is erroneous in a fundamental respect to confine the words “during the course of the licensee’s business” to a period when the licensee is lawfully able to sell the item or display it for sale. The learned Magistrate fell into such error which was compounded by reading the words “ordinary” or “normal” into the phrase “course of the licensee’s business”. This construction is contrary to both the ordinary meaning of the words used in clause 18A(1) and the purpose of the clause lying within its broader legislative scheme. 
     
      
       
      Does the Plaintiff’s Appeal Involve a Question of Law Alone 
      ? 
       
      
    76 I return to consider whether the appeal involves a question of law alone. There was no factual dispute in this case. Although the learned Magistrate did not make findings of fact in the course of his reasons for dismissing the charges, the facts emerging from both the prosecution and defence cases in the Local Court were clear and uncontested. The Defendant had taken each of the five items in trade or pawn in the course of the licensee’s business. A label had been prepared for each item which contained a contract number. Four of the five items were placed in that part of the Defendant’s business premises nominated as the 14-day holding area. The labels were placed in that area as well, but were not attached to the items. The Gemini mountain bicycle was held by the Defendant elsewhere in its business premises. The Defendant had taken the items in this way and retained them for at least six days and up to 11 days without affixing the labels to the items. It was a deliberate decision by the Defendant not to affix physically the label to each item. 
     
      
    77 A fair reading of the learned Magistrate’s reasons supports a conclusion that his Honour approached the construction and application of clause 18A in the manner submitted by the Plaintiff. 
     
      
    78 In my view, this approach involved a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of words contained in clause 18A PSD Regulations. In effect, his Honour posed for himself the wrong statutory question for determination. There has been a misdirection as to law: Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer General (1940) SR 126 at 138; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156; Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani [2005] NSWSC 1013 at paragraph 27. I am satisfied that the appeal is based upon a ground that involves a question of law alone.  
     
      
    79 I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the learned Magistrate erred in law in his construction of clause 18A PSD Regulations. I am satisfied also that the learned Magistrate erred in law in dismissing each of the five charges upon the basis of the erroneous construction of the provision. 
     
      
    80 The arguments raised in the Defendant’s Notice of Contention may be disposed of shortly. I am not satisfied that the arguments advanced by the Defendant, or any of them, reflects the true construction and operation of clause 18A. I have concluded that the provision requires the tag or label to be attached physically to the item. I reject the Defendant’s submission to the effect that some act less than physical attachment satisfies the obligation under the clause. 
     
      
    81 I do not accept the Defendant’s submission that the requirement under s.21 PSD Act not to alter an item can, in some way, provide a lawful basis upon which the Defendant can refrain from complying with the mandatory provision in clause 18A(1). I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that, by selecting the use of stickers only, the Defendant cannot avoid compliance with the obligation under the clause. Other methods of affixing a tag or label to an item are available, in any event, which would not have the difficulty asserted by the Defendant. The affixing of a tag or label by use of string or adhesive tape would appear to satisfy the requirements of the clause. 
     
      
    82 I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that compliance by the Defendant with other obligations under the PSD Act and Regulations by way of record keeping does not, in some way, absolve the Defendant from compliance with the mandatory provisions in clause 18A.  
     
      
    83 In summary, I conclude that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the learned Magistrate erred in law in his construction of clause 18A PSD Regulations by excluding from the phrase  
      “each item taken in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business” 
       the 14-day holding period required under s.21 PSD Act; 
       
       
      (b) properly construed, compliance with the obligation under clause 18A PSD Regulations requires the physical affixing to the item of a tag or label bearing the contract number or stock number promptly after the taking of the item by the licensee in trade or pawn during the course of the licensee’s business; 
       
       
      (c) in the circumstances of the present case, compliance with clause 18A PSD Regulations required that a tag or label be affixed to each of the five items promptly after the tag or label was created at the time of, or soon after, the purchase of each item. 
       
      
    84 Having determined that the learned Magistrate has erred in law in dismissing the five charges, I propose to allow the appeal and to set aside the order dismissing the charges under s.59(2)(a) Appeal and Review Act and remit the matter to the Local Court to be heard and determined according to law. I do not consider that it is necessary to make declarations as sought in the Summons in addition to these proposed orders. 
     
      
       
      Costs 
       
      
    85 The Plaintiff seeks an order for costs. The Defendant submits that no order for costs should be made against the Defendant having regard to the history of the matter and the fact that the appeal, according to the Defendant, appears to have been agitated by the Plaintiff as a test case. The Defendant points to the learned Magistrate’s general findings of no intentional illegality being involved in the Defendant’s conduct (T292).  
     
      
    86 The Plaintiff has succeeded entirely on the appeal. The Defendant contested the appeal and resisted the grant of relief being sought. It is not uncommon for appeals to be brought to this Court under the Appeal and Review Act with respect to regulatory offences. This is another example of such an appeal. In the exercise of discretion, I propose to order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
     
      
    87 The Defendant seeks a certificate under s.6 Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. The Defendant is a corporation. I note that s.6(7)(b) and (c) of that Act limits the circumstances in which an indemnity certificate may be granted in favour of a corporation. I do not know whether the Defendant is excluded from eligibility for an indemnity certificate because it falls within s.6(7)(b) or (c) Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. If the Defendant is eligible for a certificate under the Act, I propose to order that the Defendant have such a certificate.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    88 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appeal is allowed; 
       
       
      (b) pursuant to s.59(2) Appeal and Review Act, I set aside the order made at Wollongong Local Court on 2 September 2005 dismissing five charges against the Defendant under clause 18A(1) PSD Regulations; 
       
       
      (c) I order that the proceedings be remitted to the Wollongong Local Court to be heard and determined according to law; 
       
       
      (d) I order the Defendant to pay the costs of the Plaintiff of these proceedings, but grant to the Defendant, if qualified, a certificate under s.6  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 
      .

     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of James J in draft. As his Honour emphasises the Regulation prohibits the importation of “counterfeit credit, debit and charge cards.” Accordingly, the question which required to be answered was whether the items which the appellant was carrying were appropriately described as “counterfeit credit cards.”2 The evidence of Mr Scott-Rogers, which was tendered by the Crown, indicated that the creation of a valid credit card involves two stages – the cutting of the card and the inclusion of appropriate artwork followed by the “embossing” of the card. Only when “embossed” will the card be capable of being used in an electronic reader or be capable of being passed off as a genuine card. The Crown submitted that the cards which the appellant imported were counterfeit credit cards although none of the work which is required at the second stage had been undertaken.3 The evidence of persons involved in the credit card business was equivocal. Mr Scott-Rogers gave evidence that Visa International consider a card with a Visa logo, Visa hologram and other Visa marks to be a counterfeit card, whether or not it is embossed or encoded. Mr Keaney from MasterCard indicated that that organisation would not consider the card to be counterfeit unless embossed or encoded.4 To my mind before a card could be described as a counterfeit credit card it must be in a form which makes it capable of use. The cards imported by the appellant may be properly described as incomplete copies of credit cards incorporating as they do the artwork details from legitimate cards. However, without more they were not counterfeit. Although intended as an imitation card they were not capable of being passed as the original item (see the definition of counterfeit in the Macquarie Dictionary).5 Any doubt I had about the matter is removed by consideration of the definition of counterfeit money in the Crimes Act. Just as the Legislature thought it necessary to provide that “counterfeit money” included money which could not be uttered and was not complete, in my opinion, the definition of “counterfeit credit card” would require similar extension before it would include cards which were not capable of being passed off or used in any manner.6 I agree with the orders proposed by James J.7 JAMES J: Jesengar Pulinggam appealed against his conviction after a trial in the District Court before her Honour Judge Hock and a jury on a charge under s 233BAB of the Customs Act (Commonwealth).8 The charge as stated in the indictment was in the following terms, that the appellant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 4 June 2004 at Sydney, New South Wales. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
          
        (a) did intentionally import goods; 
         
          
           (b) those goods, namely counterfeit credit cards, were tier 2 goods, and the said Jesengar Pulinggam was reckless as to that fact; and 
           
          (c) their importation was prohibited under the  
          Customs Act 
           1901 unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained pursuant to section 4T of the  
          Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 
           1956 and, at the time of importation, that approval had not been obtained.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 There was another charge in the indictment but the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on that other charge and it is unnecessary to make any further reference to it.10 Her Honour sentenced the appellant to a sentence of imprisonment for six years commencing on 4 June 2004, the date on which the offence had been committed and the appellant had been arrested and from which the appellant had remained in custody, with a non-parole period of three years eight months. In the event of his appeal against his conviction not succeeding, the appellant applies for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Hock.11 Section 233BAB(1) of the Customs Act provides that the Regulations made under the Act may provide that a number of classes of goods, including (i) “counterfeit credit, debit and charge cards” constitute “tier 2 goods”.Section 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(5)A person is guilty of an offence against this subsection if:  
         
         (a)the person intentionally imported goods; and  
         
         (b)the goods were tier 2 goods and the person was reckless as to that fact; and 
         
         (c)their importation:  
         
         (i)was prohibited under this Act absolutely; or  
         
          
          (ii)was prohibited under this Act unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained and, at the time of the importation, that approval had not been obtained.  
          
         
          
         
         Maximum penalty: A fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both”. 
         
          
        
       
      
    12 Regulation 4T(1) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations provides that the importation into Australia of a counterfeit credit, debit or charge card is prohibited, unless a permission to import the card has been given by the responsible Minister. It was not disputed at the trial that no permission had been given.13 The only ground of appeal against conviction is:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There has been a miscarriage of justice in that there should have been a verdict by direction with regard to the element of ‘counterfeit credit cards’”. 
        
       
      
    14 Because of the limited nature of the only ground of appeal against conviction, it is not necessary to give more than a brief outline of the Crown case at the trial. The witnesses for the Crown at the trial included a number of Customs officers, a Federal police officer, an executive of a company Data Card Worldwide Pty Limited with which the appellant had claimed to be associated, Mr Scott-Rogers an employee of Visa International and Mr Keaney an employee of MasterCard International. The appellant did not give any evidence or call any evidence at the trial.15 The Customs officers gave evidence establishing that on 4 June 2004 the appellant, a Malaysian citizen, arrived at Sydney Airport as a passenger on a Malaysian Airlines flight. His baggage consisted of a carry on bag and four boxes. In the incoming passenger card completed by the appellant he ticked a section indicating that he had goods to declare. 16 When asked by a Customs officer what goods he was declaring, the appellant said that he had cards and card scanners and that he was going to an exhibition at Darling Harbour in Sydney. The appellant produced one of the cards, which appeared to be a visitor’s pass. It was a small plastic card, on which there was an adhesive label with the word “visitor” on it.17 One of the Customs officers, from his knowledge of a previous seizure by Customs, suspected that the adhesive label might be covering a credit card. The officer succeeded, with some difficulty, in peeling away part of the adhesive label and discovered under the label what appeared to be a credit card.18 When the boxes in the appellant’s baggage were searched they were found to contain 2250 cards purporting to be visitor passes on which there were adhesive labels. When the adhesive labels were removed, cards having at least some of the characteristics of credit cards were revealed. Henceforth in this judgment I will refer to the cards, with the adhesive labels removed, as “the cards”.19 At the trial photographs of a number of the cards were admitted into evidence and two of the actual cards were admitted into evidence as exhibits E and N. It was common ground at the trial and on this appeal that these two cards could be regarded as typical of all the cards. It is convenient to refer to exhibit E as the Visa card and exhibit N as the MasterCard card (without making any assumption that either card was a valid credit card or any kind of credit card). Exhibits E and N were inspected by this Court on the hearing of the appeal.20 On the front of the Visa card there are:- (i) In the bottom-right corner, a rectangle with the word “VISA” in blue and with horizontal blue and gold stripes. This feature was referred to in some of the evidence in the trial as the Visa logo.(ii) On the right-hand side of the card, a square with an illuminated dove in it. This feature was referred to in some of the evidence in the trial as the Visa hologram.(iii) In the top left-hand corner of the card, the Westpac symbol (resembling a capital W) and the words “Australia’s First Bank.”(iv) Near the bottom of the card, the printed words “Valid From”, ”Until End” and “Month/Year”. 21 On the back of the Visa card there is a black horizontal stripe, the words “Authorised Signature”, a panel on which the word “VISA” is printed numerous times and the printed words “Cards Customer Service Call Centre,” with telephone numbers for Australia and overseas, and the Westpac symbol.22 All of the features on the front and back of the Visa card which I have just described closely resemble corresponding features in a genuine Westpac Visa credit card. There are not, however, on the front of the Visa card any number as being the number of the card, any dates as being the dates within which the card is valid or any name of any cardholder.23 On the front of the MasterCard card there are:- 
     
      
      (i) In the bottom right-hand corner, two intersecting red and gold circles with the printed word “MasterCard”. 
      
     (ii) On the right-hand side of the card, an illuminated map of the world. 
     
      
      (iii) In the top left-hand corner of the card, the printed words “Commonwealth Bank”. 
      
     
     
      
      (iv) Near the bottom of the card the printed words “Valid Dates…Month…Year…Month…Year” 
      
    24 On the back of the MasterCard card there are a white horizontal stripe, a panel on which the word “MasterCard” is printed a number of times and the printed words “Authorised Signature. Not valid until signed”.25 All of the features on the front and the back of the MasterCard card which I have just described closely resemble the corresponding features on a genuine MasterCard credit card. There are not, however, on the front of the MasterCard card any number as being the number of the card, any dates as being the dates within which the card is valid or any name of any cardholder.26 Mr Scott-Rogers, the Business Development Manager for Visa International in Australia, gave evidence about the production and issuing of Visa credit cards. Visa credit cards are issued by banks which have entered into agreements with Visa International. The banks purchase blank cards from manufacturers who have been certified by Visa International. There are two stages in the production of a Visa credit card from a blank card (1) the printing of the artwork, which includes the Visa logo and the Visa hologram (2) the embossing and encoding of the card.27 Mr Scott-Rogers gave the following evidence about these two stages:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ll start with embossing first. Well, perhaps I’ll start with the printed card. A printed card is something which requires the member’s own bank identification, and also the Visa brand. There are specifications about the colour usage that we must adhere to, and particular products, gold and platinum and the like, have specific colours restricted for their use only. So that is point 1, and that the card printing is the first phase or the artwork that we would look at. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Second phase is the embossing of the card…. But embossing is the raising or the personalisation of the card by raising part of that card. So it’s like Braille if you like, it’s a raised feature, with the cardholder name, the expiry date and the account number, and the encoding is the magnetic stripe on the back of the card or these days a chip can also be available on cards, and the encoding is the personalised details which are provided on to that card, so in an electronic environment the card particulars can be read”. 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Scott-Rogers explained that a valid Visa credit card has a long number of thirteen to nineteen digits embossed on the front of the card. The first six digits are the identification number of the bank issuing the credit card. The first four digits of the number are also printed on the front of a valid Visa credit card. 29 In examination in chief Mr Scott-Rogers agreed with what he had said in a statement he had previously made, that there are two main types of counterfeit credit card transactions, which he described as:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… one type of counterfeit credit card transaction is where a blank unauthorised credit card is produced, and then legitimate cardholder details are embossed or encoded on to that counterfeit card. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        And the second main type of counterfeit credit card transaction is where there is a genuine credit card where the details have been taken off; the embossing and encoding have been taken off, and other details put back on to what was once a genuine card”. 
        
       
      
    30 Under Visa International’s own regulations a counterfeit card is defined as:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s a device or instrument that is printed, embossed or encoded as to purport to be a card, but that is not a card because an issuer did not authorise its printing, embossing or encoding”. 
        
       
      
    31 Mr Scott-Rogers said in evidence that within Visa International a card printed with a Visa logo and a Visa hologram and other Visa marks, which has not been authorised by Visa International, is considered to be a counterfeit credit card, whether or not it is embossed or encoded.32 In cross-examination Mr Scott-Rogers said that, if an attempt had been made to use one of the Visa cards which had been seized, the attempt would have been unsuccessful, because there was no embossing or encoding.33 Mr Scott-Rogers agreed that a definition by MasterCard of a counterfeit MasterCard credit card would also apply (with necessary adaptations) to Visa credit cards, namely:- 
     
      
       
        
        “An instrument or a device embossed, printed or otherwise bearing MasterCard marks so as to purport to be a MasterCard issued by a member or affiliate, that is not a MasterCard because the embossing or printing thereof was not authorised or because the MasterCard has been altered or refabricated, even though it was validly issued initially”. 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Keaney gave evidence about MasterCard credit cards similar to Mr Scott-Rogers’ evidence about Visa credit cards. MasterCard credit cards are produced and issued in a way similar to that in which Visa credit cards are produced and issued. The MasterCard logo consists of two intersecting red and yellow circles with the word “MasterCard”. The MasterCard hologram is an illuminated map of the world.35 In cross-examination Mr Keaney agreed that exhibit N did not fall within MasterCard’s own definition of a credit card, because “the dictionary defines a credit card as having embossed details on it”.36 At the close of the Crown case at the trial, counsel for the appellant at the trial made an application for a directed verdict on the grounds that the cards which the appellant had imported were not capable of being found by the jury to be “counterfeit credit cards”, which was an element of the offence charged. Counsel referred to the definitions which had been given in evidence of “credit card” and “counterfeit credit card”. It was conceded that, if the cards which had been imported were capable of being found to be “counterfeit credit cards”, then it was a question of fact for the jury whether the jury should find that the cards were “counterfeit credit cards”.37 The application for a directed verdict was opposed by the Crown. It was conceded by the Crown that the cards did not fall within the definitions of a “credit card” but it was submitted that the question was whether the cards were capable of being found to be “counterfeit credit cards” and that expression should be interpreted as “one phrase that can’t be separated”, that is into “credit cards” and “counterfeit”. It was submitted that s 233BAB should be given a purposive interpretation and reference was made to s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act. It was submitted by the Crown that the cards satisfied the definition of “counterfeit” in the Oxford English Dictionary namely “made in imitation, not genuine, forged; imitate fraudulently; resemble closely”.38 The trial judge delivered a short judgment, rejecting the application for a directed verdict. Her Honour held:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the word ‘counterfeit’ should not be separately construed or defined from the phrase in total, that is counterfeit credit cards. As a matter of law simply because the cards are not credit cards does not mean they are not counterfeit credit cards, as someone inelegantly expressed”. 
          
        
       
      
    39 On this appeal it was common ground that there is no definition of the word “counterfeit” in the Customs Act or in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Reference was made by both counsel to the definition of “counterfeit money” in s 3 of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981.40 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that, in the absence of a directly applicable statutory definition, recourse could be had to definitions of “counterfeit” in the Macquarie Dictionary and in Butterworths Australian Criminal Law Dictionary, to the definitions of “credit card” and “counterfeit credit card” used by Visa International and MasterCard International, to a number of eighteenth century English cases in which the accused had been charged with counterfeiting coins and to a Victorian single judge decision in a civil case Duranol Co Pty Limited v Glenvern Novelty Sweet Co [1957] VR 542.41 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that it was a question of degree whether a non-genuine card sufficiently resembled a genuine credit card as to be capable of being held to be a “counterfeit credit card” and that, while the cards which the appellant had imported were in the process of becoming counterfeit credit cards, they had not yet become counterfeit credit cards, because of the absence of embossments and encoding. In the absence of embossments and encoding, the cards the appellant had imported were not capable of being used as credit cards.42 It was submitted by the Crown that the appellant’s submissions amounted to saying that a non-genuine card could not be a “counterfeit credit card”, unless it was in a fit state to be uttered or used. It was pointed out that the charge against the appellant was not a charge of uttering.43 It was submitted by the Crown that the eighteenth century English cases to which counsel for the appellant had referred were of no assistance, because they depended on the terms of the particular legislation creating the offences. Likewise, it was submitted that Duranol was of no assistance.44 It was submitted by the Crown that the definition of “counterfeit money” in the Crimes (Currency) Act could properly be referred to as being a definition in an earlier statute which was in pari materia with s 233BAB of the Customs Act, which had been inserted in the Customs Act in the year 2000.45 It was contended by the Crown that a purposive approach should be adopted in interpreting s 233BAB of the Customs Act and that the objects of the section would not be promoted, if the Court were to decline to find that the cards were at least capable of being counterfeit credit cards.DECISIONAn essential element of the offence under s 233BAB of the Customs Act with which the appellant was charged was that the cards he had imported were “counterfeit credit cards”. 46 At the trial the trial judge refused the application by counsel for the appellant at the trial, that she direct a verdict for the appellant on the grounds that the cards which the appellant had imported were not capable of being found by the jury to be “counterfeit credit cards” and the ground of appeal against conviction, as framed, is to the effect that her Honour’s refusal to direct a verdict of not guilty gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.47 It may be that the question for this Court, the trial having proceeded and the appellant having been found guilty, is whether the verdict of guilty “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence” (see s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act), rather than whether the trial judge erred in not directing a verdict. However, it was common ground on the hearing of the appeal, and I would agree, that, for all practical purposes, the issue to be determined by this Court is the same as that determined by her Honour, that is whether the cards imported by the appellant were capable of being found by the jury to be “counterfeit credit cards”.48 As was pointed out by both counsel, there is no definition of “counterfeit” or “counterfeit credit cards” in the Customs Act and, in the absence of definitions in the Customs Act, it is appropriate to have recourse to extrinsic materials and principles of statutory interpretation. However, before considering the extrinsic materials and principles of interpretation to which this Court was referred, I will make some general observations.49 I agree with counsel for the Crown and the trial judge that the expression “counterfeit credit cards” cannot be interpreted, simply by separating the expression into two parts, namely “credit cards” and “counterfeit” and enquiring separately whether the cards imported were “credit cards” and whether they were “counterfeit”. Counterfeit credit cards are not a sub-set of the set consisting of valid credit cards.50 However, I also agree with counsel for the appellant that cards will not be capable of being “counterfeit credit cards”, unless they have a certain degree of approximation or resemblance to valid credit cards. For example, a blank plastic card, even if of the same size and shape as a credit card, but on which nothing has been printed or embossed, would not be capable of being a counterfeit credit card.51 I will now turn to a consideration of the extrinsic materials to which the Court was referred. 52 The evidence by Mr Scott-Rogers and Mr Keaney is somewhat ambivalent and would not, in any event, be determinative. According to Mr Scott-Rogers’ evidence, the cards in their present state could not give rise to either of what he described as the two main types of counterfeit credit card transactions. On the other hand, Mr Scott-Rogers said that a card printed, without authorisation by Visa, with the Visa logo and the Visa hologram would be regarded by Visa as a counterfeit credit card, even if it had not been embossed or encoded. Mr Scott-Rogers agreed that the cards would not fall within the MasterCard definition of “credit card”, which he accepted would also apply to Visa credit cards. The cards would not fall within the definition of “credit card”, because the definition of credit card required that there be a cardholder with a credit limit who would subsequently be billed and that the card could be used to purchase goods and services on credit and to obtain cash. Mr Keaney agreed that the cards did not fall within the MasterCard definition of a “credit card”.53 I do not consider that the eighteenth century English cases on charges of counterfeiting coins, to which we were referred by counsel for the appellant in his written submissions, are of any assistance. As was submitted by the Crown, they would appear to depend on the words of the statutes creating the offences. 54 Nor do I consider that the Victorian case of Duranol is of any assistance. In that case the defendant in a civil case, who had been sued for goods sold and delivered, raised a defence that the goods, which were plastic tokens, were counterfeit coins within the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth). It was held by Deane J of the Victorian Supreme Court that the word “coin” in the Crimes Act was limited to articles made of metal. 55 The definition of “counterfeit” in the Macquarie Dictionary which might be relevant is the first definition given, namely “made to imitate and to pass for something else; not genuine”. The definition of “counterfeit” given in Butterworths Australian Criminal Law Dictionary at page 51 is “an imitation that is passed as the original item”. These dictionary definitions would tend to lend some support to the appellant.56 As noted earlier in this judgment, the Crown sought to rely on the definition of “counterfeit money” in s 3 of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981 (Commonwealth), as being a definition of an expression including the word “counterfeit” in a statute which was in pari materia with s 233BAB of the Customs Act. 57 The definition of “counterfeit money” in the Crimes (Currency) Act is:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) any article, not being a genuine coin or genuine paper money, that resembles, or is apparently intended to resemble, or pass for, a genuine coin or genuine paper money; or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) any article, being a genuine coin or genuine paper money, that has been altered in a material respect and in such manner as to conceal, or to be apparently intended to conceal the alteration; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        and includes any such article whether it is or is not in a fit state to be uttered and whether the process of manufacture or alteration is or is not complete”. 
        
       
      
    58 It seems to me that the inclusion in the definition of the final words, that an article is included whether or not it is in a fit state to be uttered and whether the process of manufacture is or is not complete, when such words do not appear in the Customs Act, tends to support the appellant rather than the Crown.59 The Crown submitted that s 233BAB of the Customs Act should be given a purposive interpretation and referred to s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act. I accept that in recent years courts have adopted a much more purposive approach to the interpretation of statutes, including criminal statutes. See Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (5th Ed) at pars 9.8-9.15 and the cases there cited. In Beckwirth v R (1976) 12 ALR 333 at 339 Gibbs J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences … The rule is perhaps one of last resort”. 
        
       
      
    60 In the present case, the trial judge having declined to direct a verdict of not guilty, the jury found a verdict of guilty and must have concluded that the cards imported by the appellant were “counterfeit credit cards”. However, in the summing-up the question which the trial judge identified as the question for the jury to decide on this aspect of the case was “whether in fact they (the cards) were imitations, counterfeit, not genuine credit cards”. Stating the question the jury had to decide in this way would have tended to focus the jury’s attention on whether the cards were “imitations, counterfeit, not genuine”, to which there could be only one answer, rather than on whether the cards had a sufficient degree of resemblance or approximation to credit cards.61 As I have already remarked, the question which the Court has to determine is a question of degree and I do not consider that the Court should attempt to lay down any general tests on when a card which, without authorisation, has some characteristics of a credit card attains such a degree of approximation or resemblance to a credit card as to be capable of being a “counterfeit credit card”.62 In the present case, where there had been no embossing of a cardholder’s name on the card, no embossing of a period during which the card would be valid on the card, no embossing of any number on the card, no encoding of any personal information in the magnetic stripe on the back of the card and the card could not be used to pay for goods or services or to withdraw cash, I consider that the cards imported by the appellant were not capable of being found to be “counterfeit credit cards”. In my opinion, such a conclusion is assisted by the dictionary definitions of “counterfeit”, the absence of any extended definition, or any definition, of “counterfeit” in the Customs Act and the degree of caution which I consider courts still exercise in holding that statutes creating offences apply to conduct not clearly within their terms.63 I would allow the appeal, quash the verdict of guilty and direct entry of a verdict of acquittal. If the appeal against conviction is allowed, it is unnecessary to deal with the appeal against sentence.64 HALL J: I agree with James J.

     Judgment 
    1 HODGSON JA: On 23 February 2005, the appellant was indicted before Coorey DCJ at the Parramatta District Court on the following counts:(1) That he between 1 March 2003 and 1 April 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on SD.(2) That he between 1 March 2003 and 1 April 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with SD without the consent of SD knowing that she was not consenting. (3) (In the alternative to count 2) That he between 1 March 2003 and 1 April 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales, being a male, had carnal knowledge of a female above the age of 16 years such female being his sister (namely SD).(4) That he between 1 May 2003 and 1 June 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on SD.(5) That he between 1 May 2003 and 1 June 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with SD without the consent of SD knowing that she was not consenting. (6) (In the alternative to count 5) That he between 1 May 2003 and 1 June 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales, being a male, had carnal knowledge of a female above the age of 16 years such female being his sister (namely SD).(7) That he on 9 May 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on SD.(8) That he on 9 May 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with SD without the consent of SD knowing that she was not consenting. (9) (In the alternative to count 8) That he on 9 May 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales, being a male, had carnal knowledge of a female above the age of 16 years such female being his sister (namely SD).(10) That he between 1 June 2003 and 25 June 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on SD.(11) That he between 1 June 2003 and 25 June 2003 at South Granville in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with SD without the consent of SD knowing that she was not consenting. 2 Counts 1, 4, 7 and 10 were charges of an offence under s.61L of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Counts 2, 5, 8 and 11 were charges of an offence under s.61I of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Counts 3, 6 and 9 were charges of an offence under s.78A of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 8 years.3 The appellant pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was tried before his Honour and a jury of twelve. On 14 March 2005, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of counts1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 11. The jury was not able to come to a unanimous decision in respect of counts 7, 8 and 9. 4 On 6 October 2005, the appellant was sentenced as follows. In respect of counts 1, 4 and 10, on each count, to a fixed term of 12 months, to commence on 14 March 2005, to be served concurrently; and in respect of counts 2, 5 and 11, on each count, imprisonment for 7 years, to commence on 14 March 2005, and to expire on 13 March 2012, with a non-parole period of four years, to expire on 13 March 2009, to be served concurrently. 5 The appellant appeals from his conviction, and seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed on him.6 The Crown case was that on four occasions in 2003, the appellant indecently assaulted and then had sex with his sister, who was then a 47 year old intellectually disabled woman. 7 The complainant gave evidence that the appellant would visit her occasionally in 2003 when he was working not far from where she was living. On four occasions, he touched her breasts, and then had sexual intercourse with her, without her consent. The complainant gave evidence of seeing warts on the appellant’s penis. Shortly after the last occasion when sexual intercourse took place, the complainant’s younger sister DW arrived from Maitland. The complainant told DW that the appellant had just raped her, and on 25 June 2003 DW took the complainant to Granville police station where DW reported the matter to Sergeant Matthew Mezgee. The complainant then went to Westmead Hospital, where she was examined. 8 DW gave evidence that she went to visit the complainant on 25 June 2003, and that when the complainant answered the door she was shaking and crying. The complainant told her that the appellant had had sex with her. DW later took the appellant to Granville police station. 9 Detective Senior Constable Egan gave evidence of collecting items from the complainant’s home, including a towel and lounge cushion; and of arresting the appellant and conducting an interview with him, in which the appellant denied the allegations against him. 10 Visits by the appellant to the complainant’s house received some corroboration from a neighbour William Staines, and the appellant’s employer Warren Bale. 11 The complainant’s doctor Dr. Joseph Malouf gave evidence of visits by the complainant on 9 May 2003 and 23 May 2003, saying that on the former occasion the complainant complained of pain during intercourse. However, she did not complain that she had been sexually abused by the appellant.12 Associate Professor Susan Hayes gave evidence that the complainant had mild intellectual disability, with an IQ of about 70, putting her in the lowest 2 per cent of the population. 13 Robert Goetz, a forensic biologist, gave evidence of receiving items from the police to be tested, including a towel and lounge cushions. Semen was found on the towel and on one of the lounge cushions, and DNA taken was compared with a reference sample taken from the appellant. All three samples had the same profile. The probability of that profile being found in anyone selected randomly was less than one in ten billion; and the probability of it being found in a brother of the appellant was approximately one in 6,700. (No sample was in fact taken from the appellant’s brother G, who was living at the complainant’s home prior to 6 March 2003.) DNA testing could not indicate when DNA was placed on an item, apart from probably being contributed since the last wash. There was a very high degree of probability that the DNA taken from the towel came from the sperm found on it. 14 Dr Anthony Moynahan of the New South Wales Police was sent photographs of the appellant’s genital region, and observed a lesion of one-half to one centimetre, which could be a genital wart, cyst, or abscess. 15 The appellant’s defence was that no sexual intercourse occurred, and that the complainant was either fabricating the allegations because the appellant refused to give her money or wanted her out of the house, or was unreliable, as shown by many inconsistencies in her evidence. The DNA either was present through innocent reasons, or was from the appellant’s brother. The appellant did not give evidence himself, but called three witnesses.16 Naomi Quinlan, the ex-de facto partner of the appellant’s son, gave evidence that she visited the complainant in April 2004 to get contact details for the appellant and his wife; and that on that occasion, the complainant said she did not speak to the appellant, and went on to say that if the appellant had given her the money when she had asked him, she would not have lied. 17 Cheryl Sells, the de facto wife of the appellant for 27 years, gave evidence that she and the appellant lived with the complainant for about six to twelve months in 1997-1998, and that the lounge on which some of the offences were said to have occurred was brought over by them. Ms. Sells gave evidence that she and the appellant had had sex on that lounge; and also that she had used her own linen partly because the complainant was unhygienic about washing her linen, and also because the appellant was suffering from genital warts. Ms. Sells gave evidence that she had told the complainant she wanted to use her own linen because the appellant was suffering from warts.18 Rick Crouch, a co-worker with the appellant, gave alibi evidence in relation to 9 May 2003. 19 The trial proceeded for ten days, and then the trial judge commenced summing up on the tenth day, namely Wednesday 9 March 2005. Summing up continued from 2pm on 10 March 2005, and later that afternoon the trial judge asked the jury to retire and consider its verdict, commencing the next morning. On 11 March 2005, the trial judge gave further directions, and the jury retired to consider its verdict at 11.05am. At 3.20pm, the trial judge answered a question from the jury. On Monday 14 March 2005, the trial judge played a tape of evidence requested by the jury, and the jury retired to further consider its verdict at about 11am. The jury returned with its verdicts later that day, and was discharged at 2.22pm. GROUNDS OF APPEAL20 Initially, the appellant relied on five grounds of appeal. However only three were pursued, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        A. The summing up to the jury was not clear and concise and thereby confusing. 
         
        C. Perceived bias or prejudice. 
         
        E. Sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    SUMMING UP21 Mr. Dailly made the following submissions in support of this ground: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour began summing up to the jury on Wednesday 9 March 2005 prior to the luncheon adjournment. His Honour continued his directions following the luncheon period and at the close of the day sent the jury away to deliberate, subject to any further matters raised by the Crown and Defence.  
         
         
        2. At that point in time His Honour conceded some minor factual misdirections given to the jury and agreed to clear up those errors (transcript Wednesday 9 March 2005 page 30). Discussions were further had concerning appropriate directions relating to delay (a Longman type direction was specifically discussed) and a direction concerning the DNA evidence. 
         
         
        3. The jury were subsequently returned and the DNA direction was given as well as the other factual errors were corrected. Again the jury were sent away subject to further directions being given.  
         
         
        4. On Thursday 10 March 2005 the jury were returned and further directions were given. His Honour indicated at the conclusion of his directions that all the directions of law were complete (transcript 10 March 2005 page 12). His Honour then comments further on the evidence for an additional 25 pages. He then again sends the jury away pending any further necessary directions or instructions.  
         
         
        5. The jury are then again returned where His Honour stated  
        ""Ladies and Gentlemen just a couple of matters that I have overlooked""  
        (transcript 10 March 2005 page 42). On page 43 of that transcript His Honour sends the jury away to deliberate on their verdict.  
         
         
        6. On Friday 11 March 2005 the jury are again returned for further clarification of directions which His Honour realised were incorrect. In particular a misdirection concerning the existence of sperm and the connection to sexual intercourse and sexual activity. Again the jury are sent away to deliberate upon their verdict (transcript 11 March 2005 page 14). On that day the jury return again due to a jury question. They then retire for that day. 
         
         
        7. On Monday 14 March 2005 the jury are again returned for the purposes of answering a jury question. It is that day guilty verdicts were returned in relation to charges one, two, four, five, ten and eleven. The matter then proceeded to sentencing at a later date.  
         
         
        8. It is submitted that the manner of His Honour's summing up went to confusing the jury by being continually recalled and corrected in relation to factual matters and directions according to law.  
         
         
        9. A Judges (sic) summing up should be as succinct as possible so as not to confuse the jury [see  
        R v Flesch and McKenzie (1986) 7 NSWLR 554 at 558 
        . STREET CJ stated  
        ""I reiterate that the conventional direction, which is concise and brief, is that which it is preferable to adopt unless there be reason to depart from it""  
        (ibid at  
        558).  
         
         
        10. STREET CJ further stated  
        ""In particular, a lengthy development of the concept such as appears in this summing up will almost always lead to a situation in which a jury is at risk of being confused and hence it nearly always will present at least the risk of it being held that there has been a misdirection""  
        (ibid at 558).  
         
         
        11. It is submitted that His Honour's directions were not clear and concise and were therefore confusing to the jury. As a result the jury were misdirected.  
        
       
      
    22 I note that the statements by Street CJ referred to in those submissions related to a direction as to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and were to the effect that there should not be lengthy elaboration of that concept. However, it is also true that Street CJ did say that “prolixity in summings up is to be discouraged; conciseness is better calculated to achieve clarity and intelligibility”: R v. Flesch and McKenzie (1986) 7 NSWLR 554 at 558. 23 Mr. Dailly was unable to point to any particular matter in the summing up which amounted to a misdirection to the jury in any sense adverse to the appellant: he relied rather on the mere circumstance that the summing up extended over a number of days and involved the jury being recalled on a number of occasions, with some corrections being made. In my opinion, this is insufficient to make out a case for setting aside the verdict of the jury. 24 In fact, in so far as the summing up could be considered confusing, it was significantly favourable to the appellant. In particular, in giving further directions about the DNA evidence at the request of the appellant’s Counsel, the trial judge said “I direct you that the evidence of the matching DNA profile establishes no more than that the accused could be the person who deposited the DNA found in the sample”, although he did later say “DNA evidence may have significance when considered with other evidence in the case”. He did not tell the jury, as he might have, that the DNA evidence gave positive support to the Crown case, or explain to the jury how it did so.PERCEIVED BIAS OR PREJUDICE25 On the ninth day of the trial, shortly after 10am and just before the final witness for the defence was called, the Crown prosecutor made submissions to the trial judge to the effect that a suggestion made by the Crown prosecutor to a defence witness that she was committing perjury should not have been disallowed. In the course of the discussion, in the absence of the jury, of Crown submissions on this matter, relating to whether the witness was lying under oath, the following exchange occurred between the trial judge and the appellant’s then Counsel Mr. Pontello: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don't know, I don't know if this witness was lying or not, the witness may be lying, but it's not for me to - I mean Mr Pontello, I may as well tell you, when an accused person does not go in the witness box, I have a certain suspicion. When an accused does not give evidence, I have a strong suspicion of guilt, in my mind, I really do, and I was a defender, I defended for 20 years plus seven years. I honestly believe in my mind when an accused doesn't go in the witness box, I have a strong suspicion that there was something to hide, that's my belief, but that's got nothing to do with me as a judge, has it?  
         
         
        PONTELLO: No your Honour.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: But that's just my personal view which I can't shake off.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: Your Honour shouldn't be expressing those at this point in the trial with the accused sitting in the dock, I mean it's not really--  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I'm telling you and I'm telling you that I'd been a defender for many more years than you have.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: But your Honour, it's important that, in my submission, that justice be seen to be done and--  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Pontello, you don't have to worry, I am not going to be unjust to your client. If you'd been around for any length of time, you would know that I am not unjust.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: Your Honour, I know that - your Honour, it's the perception that your Honour might be giving to the accused at this point of the trial. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I don't really worry about a perception, I think if anyone reads the transcript of any case that I do comes out and tells me that I was biased in favour of the Crown, I think they'd be - they'd need psychiatric help.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: There's no such submission your Honour, but your Honour it's important that perception is not there at all from the accused's point of view, not from the barristers, but I don't wish to be heard any further on the issue.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Pontello, I can assure your client that I am not biased against him. But I'm just telling you that my personal view is not important, that's the bottom line, that's all, it's just my personal view. I've got a lot of personal views Mr Pontello, but I don't say them in front of a jury, that's me, I'm just telling you something.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: Yes your Honour.  
        
       
      
    26 The discussion then moved back to how the trial judge should deal with the Crown’s suggestion that the defence witness was lying under oath. 27 Following that, the final defence witness was called, and the jury was addressed by the Crown prosecutor and by Mr. Pontello.28 On the following day, Mr. Pontello concluded his address, and then there was discussion in the absence of the jury before the trial judge commenced the summing up. In the course of that discussion, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: […] Mr Pontello, something that occurred to me last night also and perhaps I'll say this, I should not have said yesterday that I have suspicion of guilt about your client, even if I think it, and I only said that because I - when a person does not go in the witness box I, subjectively, me, subjectively, do have a suspicion of guilt when a person does not go in the witness box. And I was a defender for 20 years.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: Yes your Honour.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: And that's all, that's as far as it goes. There is no way in the world that your client will not get a fair trial from me. He will get a fair trial.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: I made that absolutely clear to him your Honour, but obviously the concern was that he obviously doesn't know your Honour as well as we do.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well even if I think he's personally guilty, so what. I mean it may be the truth I think he's guilty, but so what.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: Yes your Honour.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: He's not going to get an unfair trial from me because I think he's guilty.  
         
        PONTELLO: No, no, he doesn't--  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: That's not going to happen.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: No your Honour, no.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I'm in charge, but I have a personal view about this case which is obvious to you, and I've said it, that's my personal view, but that's not going to effect my judgment, that's not going to effect my judgment as a judge, and indeed I probably shouldn't have even said it but the jury was not here--  
         
         
        PONTELLO: No your Honour.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: --but you can be assured that your client will not receive an unfair trial. And I will not take into account my own personal views, they're not relevant. I will not, I will not in any way exhibit my personal views in front of this jury, full stop.  
         
         
        PONTELLO: That's accepted your Honour, yes.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Okay. So he doesn't have to worry that this judge is going to ride this case for a conviction in some way or this judge thinks he's guilty therefore this judge is going to try and influence the jury. To me that would be outside my function and intellectually dishonest if I was to do that. I would be intellectually dishonest if I was to let my own point of view effect (sic) how I sum up. But I just wanted to assure you of that and your client because I thought to myself last night I didn't want your client to worry that because I think a certain way therefore I'm going to try and influence the jury a certain way. I think we're ready for the jury.  
        
       
      
    29 That was the extent of reference to the trial judge’s comments on this matter. At no time was the trial judge asked to disqualify himself from continuing with the trial of the appellant. Submissions30 Mr. Dailly submitted that a judge should not hear, or continue to hear or determine proceedings, if affected by actual bias, or if there is a reasonable apprehension that the judge is not impartial and unprejudiced. Subject to certain qualifications relating to waiver or necessity, a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question that the judge is required to decide: Ebner v. Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337, at [6].31 Mr. Dailly submitted that a fair-minded lay observer would have had concerns about the trial judge’s comments concerning the guilt of the appellant, as identified in the transcripts for 8 and 9 March 2005. He referred to Ebner at [80], per Gaudron J, and also to Antoun v. The Queen [2006] HCA 2, at [80] and [81].32 Mr. Dailly submitted that, although the comments were not made in the presence of the jury, based on the principle of justice not only being done but also being seen to be done, a fair-minded lay observer would have obvious concerns about the trial judge’s comments and his impartiality. 33 Mr. Dailly further submitted that, even though it was not for the judge to decide guilt or innocence of the accused, a judge is still disqualified in a criminal trial with a jury if the judge’s conduct causes reasonable apprehension of bias: R v. Balic (No.2) (1994) 75 A Crim R 515. 34 Mr. Dailly also submitted that the comments, although in the absence of the jury, amounted to a breach of s.20(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        20 Comment on failure to give evidence 
         
        (1) … 
         
        (2) The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned. 
        
       
      
    35 Mr. Dailly submitted that the circumstance that no application was made to the trial judge to disqualify himself did not count against the success of this appeal. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules only applied to “direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence”. Even if waiver did apply to criminal proceedings, objection had been taken in this case: cf Vakauta v. Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568. Decision36 In my opinion, it is appropriate to approach this matter on the basis of the principles stated by Spigelman CJ in R v. Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367 at [34]-[36]: 
     
      
       
        
        34 The fact that the trial judge’s role in a jury trial is limited is not determinative of the matters, however, it is of significance. That it is not determinative is shown by the Court of Appeal in the case of  
        Balic (No 2) 
          
        (1994) 75 A Crim R 515 at 520, where their Honours said:  
         
          
          “Here any decision as to guilt or innocence at the trial will not be made by the presiding judge. It will be made by the jury. Nonetheless questions of discretionary admissibility of evidence might arise, and in subtle and sometimes imperceptible ways a judge may influence the attitude of a jury. It is of critical importance that the public and the accused have confidence in the absolute and perceived impartiality of the trial judge.” 
           
          
         
        35 The test for disqualification on the grounds of bias is now well established in Australia and has been set out in  
        Johnson v Johnson 
          
        (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 to 493:  
         
          
          “.... [T]he test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias .... is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide .... the test is objective ... two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to the reasonable; and the person being observed is ‘a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial’.” 
          
         
         
        36 As I have indicated, in a jury trial the matters which a judge is required to decide include the admissibility of evidence and also the formulation of a summing up. If there is a conviction, he or she must sentence the person so convicted. These are more limited matters than those which arise in the course of a judge-alone trial. Specifically, however, they do not include the determination of issues of credit. 
        
       
      
    See also Antoun v. The Queen [2006] HCA 2, 80 ALJR 497.37 Any question of apprehended bias has to be considered in relation to “the question which the judge is required to decide”. In a criminal trial before a jury, that question includes how to conduct the trial, in terms of rulings on evidence, comments made in the course of the trial, and the summing up to the jury. As pointed out by Spigelman CJ in Kearns, the limited role of the judge is of significance, especially in that it does not include determination of issues of credit or determination of the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. 38 This Court’s role in deciding this appeal is circumscribed by s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases 
         
        (1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
        
       
      
    39 The ground of appeal under consideration can succeed only if the Court is of opinion that there was “a miscarriage of justice”. Even if s.20(2) of the Evidence Act was breached, as submitted for the appellant, this would not in my view amount to “a wrong decision on a question of law”, so the question still must be whether this Court is of opinion that there was a miscarriage of justice. 40 In considering whether there was a miscarriage of justice, the following matters are of significance: (1) Apart from the matter considered under the first ground of appeal, there is no challenge on this appeal to any decision of the primary judge, whether as to the admission of evidence or as to what to say to the jury in the summing up: that is, there is no suggested error in anything the trial judge said or did in the actual conduct of the trial.(2) The discussion that gave rise to the comments complained of was related to a suggestion that another witness was lying, and the trial judge seems to have been pointing out why he might suspect she was (because he could not help suspecting the accused), all in the context of saying that this had nothing to do with how he as a judge would conduct the case. (3) Although the appellant’s Counsel told the judge he should not express the view he expressed, no application was made that he disqualify himself.41 In relation to the last point, it is clear that waiver is available in civil cases as an answer to an appeal grounded on an allegation of apprehended bias: Vakauta v. Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572 and 577-9, Dovade Pty. Limited v. Westpac Banking Group (1999) 46 NSWLR 168 at 181, Smits v. Roach [2004] NSWCA 233, 60 NSWLR 711, at [37]-[38]. 42 In Vakauta, at 572, Brennan J, Deane J and Gaudron J made the following observation about comments made by a judge during the course of a hearing: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Where such comments which are likely to convey to a reasonable and intelligent lay observer an impression of bias have been made, a party who has legal representation is not entitled to stand by until the contents of the final judgment are known and then, if those contents prove unpalatable, attack the judgment on the ground that, by reason of those earlier comments, there has been a failure to observe the requirements of the appearance of impartial judgment. By standing by, such a party has waived the right subsequently to object. The reason why that is so is obvious. In such a case, if clear objection had been taken to the comments at the time when they were made or the judge had then been asked to refrain from further hearing the matter, the judge may have been able to correct the wrong impression of bias which had been given or alternatively may have refrained from further hearing. It would be unfair and wrong if failure to object until the contents of the final judgment were known were to give the party in default the advantage of an effective choice between acceptance and rejection of the judgment and to subject the other party to a situation in which it was likely that the judgment would be allowed to stand only if it proved to be unfavourable to him or her. 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 However, in the same case, Dawson J at 577 commented that “In the case of a criminal prosecution where the public is directly interested in the outcome, it may be different”; but Dawson J went on to say that “even in such a case, Isaacs J in Dickson v. Edwards (1910) 10 CLR 243 at 260 was clearly of the view that a party may waive the objection”. 44 In the present case, in addition to the question whether waiver applies in a criminal case, it could be argued that objection was taken to the comments, and it was unnecessary to take the additional step of asking the judge to disqualify himself. 45 Whether or not such an objection can be waived in a criminal case, and whether or not it was in fact waived in this case, the circumstance that the judge was not asked to disqualify himself and the trial was completed means that the objective test referred to in Johnson should be applied in the light of everything that happened in the trial, both before and after the comments complained of; and consistently with Johnson, the reasonable lay observer would take into account the circumstances in which the comments were made, the circumstance that the trial judge was a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation required him to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial, the circumstance that there was no request to the judge to disqualify himself, and the circumstance of a summing up that was generally favourable to the appellant. This Court then has to decide whether there was a miscarriage of justice, in the light of these considerations, and also in the light of the lack of complaint made on appeal about any actual decision made by the trial judge. 46 Leaving aside for the moment s.20(2) of the Evidence Act, in all these circumstances I do not think an appearance of bias was shown, and in any event, I am not of opinion that there has been a miscarriage of justice. As regards s.20(2), in my opinion, this applies to comments made in the presence of the jury, and not to comments in the absence of the jury; but even if it did apply to comments made in the absence of the jury, such breach as would then have occurred in this case did not in my opinion produced a miscarriage of justice that could authorise the allowing of an appeal under s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 47 As conceded by the judge himself and by the Crown, the comments should not have been made; but the ground of appeal based on them is not made out. SENTENCE MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE48 Evidence was led on the hearing of the appeal that the appellant’s 25 year old son had a terminal illness, and, as at 15 February 2006, had an expected survival of 2-4 months at most. The medical practitioner’s letter put into evidence went on to say that the son was experiencing distress as he found it extremely difficult to visit his father in Bathurst Correctional Centre. 49 Evidence was led by the Crown that a transfer of the appellant to Cessnock Correctional Centre was approved on 28 February 2006, and that transfer took place on 8 March 2006. This evidence also indicated the possibility of leave being granted to a prisoner to visit a family member suffering serious illness. 50 Mr. Dailly submitted that the terminal illness of the appellant’s son amounted to exceptional circumstances, and that the Court could take into account the hardship that will be suffered by the appellant and his family due to the appellant’s imprisonment at this time. Mr. Dailly referred to R v. Boyle  (1987) 34 A Crim R 202, R v. T (1990) 47 A Crim R 29, and R v. Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. 51 In my opinion, the circumstances disclosed may be regarded as truly exceptional, so that the hardship to a family member could possibly be taken into account in ameliorating the sentence imposed on the appellant, in accordance with the principles discussed in Edwards. 52 However, having regard to the very short life expectancy of the appellant’s son, to ameliorate the hardship would require the quashing of the sentences imposed below and the imposition of a sentence with a non-parole period expiring immediately, that is a sentence with a non-parole period of about 14 months. 53 In my opinion, such a non-parole period would be so out of proportion with the criminality of the offences that it would not be right for the Court to respond in that way to the circumstances disclosed. 54 The circumstances are sad indeed, and it is to be hoped that either visits by the appellant’s son or leave for the appellant to visit his son can be arranged. However, for the reasons given, in my opinion the sentence imposed below should stand.ORDERS55 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made:1. Appeal against conviction dismissed.2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.56 JAMES J: I agree with Hodgson JA.57 HOEBEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA and the orders which he proposes.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal against the redetermination of an existing life sentence by Barr J authorized by cl 8 of Schedule I to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act). The life sentence was imposed by Wood J (as he then was) on 22 December 1986 following the conviction of the respondent for the murder on 10 October 1985 of a ten year old girl Kylie Jane Corbett, who was his cousin. The imposition of a life sentence was mandatory unless it was found that the offender’s culpability was significantly diminished by circumstances within the ambit of a proviso to the applicable statutory provision. Such was not the case. Wood J also stated that he declined to set a non parole period but it can be noted that, at the time and in respect of a life sentence, there was no power so to do. Nothing then or now turns on this.  
     
      
    2 A new sentencing regime was introduced by the Sentencing Act 1989 (assented to on 2 June 1989 and commencing on 21 September 1989). Later by the Sentencing (Life Sentence) Amendment Act 1989 (assented to on 21 December 1989 and commencing on 12 January 1990) prisoners such as the respondent who were serving life sentences became entitled to make an application as specified in s 13A which was then inserted into the principal Act. The terms of s 13A were: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “ 
        Existing life sentences 
        
       
       
        
        13A (1) In this section: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘ 
        existing life sentence 
        ’ 
          
        means a sentence of imprisonment for life imposed before or after the commencement of this section, but does not include a sentence for the term of a person’s natural life under section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 or section 33A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
        
       
       
        
         (2) A person serving an existing life sentence may apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for the sentence. 
        
       
       
        
         (3) Any such person is not eligible to make an application unless the person has served at least 8 years of the sentence concerned. 
        
       
       
        
         (4) The Supreme Court may, on application duly made for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) set both: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence for which the sentence was originally imposed; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) an additional term during which the person may be released on parole (being either an additional term for a specified period or for the remainder of the person’s natural life); or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (5) A minimum term set under this section is to commence on the date on which the original sentence commenced or, if the person was remanded in custody for the offence, the date on which the first such remand commenced. 
        
       
       
        
         (6) If the Supreme Court sets a minimum term and an additional term under this section, the sentence comprising those terms replaces the original sentence of imprisonment for life. 
        
       
       
        
         (7) A minimum term and an additional term set under this section are to be taken to have been set under this Part but are not required to comply with the other provisions of this Part. 
        
       
       
        
         (8) If the Supreme Court declines to determine a minimum term and an additional term, the person who made the application may not re-apply to the Court within the period of 2 years from the date of the Court’s decision, or such shorter period as the Court specifies when making that decision. 
        
       
       
        
         (9) The Supreme Court, in setting a minimum term and an additional term under this section, is to have regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) any report on the person made by the Serious Offenders Review Board and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person’s rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) any relevant comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence,  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and may have regard to any other relevant matter. 
        
       
       
        
         (10) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to reports referred to in subsection (9), including provisions relating to matters to be dealt with in reports and the making of reports available to the Supreme Court. 
        
       
       
        
         (11) The Supreme Court may make a determination for a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence even though the Court was not the sentencing court, or the Court is not constituted in the same way as it was when the applicant was sentenced. 
        
       
       
        
         (12) An appeal lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to a determination under this section or a decision to decline to make such a determination. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies to such an appeal in the same way as it applies to an appeal against a sentence.”  
        
       
      
    3 One day after the expiry of a period of eight years specified in s 13A(3), the respondent lodged such an application. However the hearing was adjourned over what became a period of years on the basis that it was “not ready to be listed”. Eventually it was listed on 1 October 1999 before Wood CJ at CL in accordance with the practice that such applications be dealt with by the original sentencing judge if that judge remained available. The respondent sought a further adjournment (until about June 2000) to allow him to complete a SORT (Sexual Offenders Redirectional Training) programme. His Honour refused the application for adjournment. He considered it “utterly inappropriate for an application of this kind to remain in limbo for six years”. He noted that until March (1999) the respondent was resisting encouragement, which had been offered to him, to engage in psychological counselling and to participate in a sexual offenders diversionary programme. The change in expressed attitude apparently coincided with a callover of the pending application under s 13A. 
     
      
    4 Wood CJ at CL dismissed the application but reduced the two year period within which re-application was prohibited to eighteen months: (s 13A (8)). 
     
      
    5 Pursuant to that order, the respondent filed a further application on 2 April 2001, that is, eighteen months and one day after the dismissal of the earlier application. Formally, the application was said to be made “pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989” but that provision had been repealed and the provisions of Schedule 1 abovementioned had been substituted. Schedule 1 applies to life sentences whether imposed before, on or after 12 January 1990 which was the commencement date of the relevant amendment which introduced s 13A.  
     
      
    6 It is convenient to note that amendments to s 13A were made by the Sentencing (Life Sentences)Amendment Act 1993 (assented to on 18 November 1993 and commencing on 21 November 1993) which included the repeal of the then existing s 13A (8) and the substitution of a new s 13A(8). Since its introduction, Schedule 1 has also been the subject of amendments which it is not necessary to detail at this point.  
     
      
    7 This second application (Wood CJ at CL being no longer available) was heard by Barr J on 16 September and 14 October 2005. On 28 October 2005 his Honour granted the application and substituted for the existing life sentence, an imposition consisting of a total term of thirty six years imprisonment with a non parole period of twenty four years dating from 10 October 1985. It follows that the earliest date of eligibility for release pursuant to that sentence will be 9 October 2009.  
     
      
    8 The ground expressed in the Crown notice of appeal is that the sentence so imposed was manifestly inadequate. Ms Woodburne of counsel who appeared for the Crown in the appeal specified that, in the event of the appeal being allowed, the order sought in lieu of that made by Barr J was that the respondent’s application be dismissed and a direction given that the respondent may never reapply to the Court. Such a direction can be made pursuant to cl 6 (1)(a) of Schedule 1 and, if made, would have the consequence that the sentence would extend for the term of the respondent’s natural life. In the alternative, it was sought that the application be dismissed and the respondent be prohibited from making further application for a period exceeding the three years specified as an “automatic” bar in cl 6 (3); as a second alternative that the application be dismissed and the inhibition against reapplication for three years be permitted to take effect; or as a third alternative that a non parole period be set but the Court decline to set a specified term of sentence, the consequence of which would be that, if the respondent were in fact released, he would be subject to parole for the remainder of his life.  
     
      
    9 The implementation of the order principally sought by the Crown (and the first alternative) is subject to the provisions of cl 6 (4) namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) A direction under this clause that an offender may never re-apply to the Court or may not re-apply to the Court for a period exceeding 3 years may be given only if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the offender was sentenced for the crime of murder, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that such a direction be made.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 It is self evident that cl 6 (4)(a) is fulfilled. So far as the first requirement in cl 6 (4)(b), Barr J described the murder as “ callous and brutal and a most serious one of its kind” and Wood CJ at CL (in 1999) referred to it as “a worst case of murder” and also observed that he regarded it as “the worst case of murder” over which he had presided since coming to the Bench in 1984. 
     
      
    11 The validity of these descriptions can scarcely be doubted having regard to the sketch of the facts to which I will turn. The crime patently lies within the classification of “a most serious case of murder”. How far the respondent has progressed, if at all, towards rehabilitation and the assessment of the risk of his re-offending are significant considerations germane to the public interest requirement of cl 6 (4)(b) and I will turn to those issues in due course. 
     
      
    12 In opening the appeal Ms Woodburne observed that in 1986 no matter in mitigation of criminality had been advanced nor was it now being advanced. She stated that it “remains an episode of sustained, deliberate and sadistic violation of an innocent young girl for which no rational explanation exists”. Those remarks were confirmed by her following summation of some of the salient facts. It is useful to quote them: 
     
      
       
        
        “(the)…murder occurred on 10 October 1985, when the respondent took his ten year old cousin, Kylie Corbett, to his flat, where, over a period of some six hours, he held her against her will, he restrained her by tying her to the bed with rope, he repeatedly threatened her with a hunting style knife, telling her, ‘If you scream or cry I’ll kill you’. He repeatedly and violently sexually assaulted Kylie with such force that she suffered extensive injuries to her vagina and anus. 
        
       
       
        
        At one point the respondent left her tied up and bleeding in the flat, while he popped out to play the pinball machines and while he purchased some chicken and chips for himself at McDonalds. Upon his return to the flat, he subjected her to further sexual assault. He washed blood off her, but wouldn’t allow her to get dressed. Instead he demanded she read to him. He tied her up again and later he killed Kylie in a most cruel way, by picking her up, lying her down on the bed. He then sat astride her and held a military style baton at either end and placed the baton against her neck underneath her chin. 
        
       
       
        
        Despite Kylie’s struggles, he choked her at least to the point of unconsciousness. He then strung her up by her neck in a wardrobe in the flat. He placed a belt around her neck by means of a slip knot. He placed her in a seated position on a chair, and he left her there to die by asphyxiation. 
        
       
       
        
        Clearly, this was a most cruel murder, attended by a number of aggravating features of the worst kind. This offence, had it been committed on anyone, would be a terrible offence, but of course it was committed on a ten year old child. It was further aggravated by the violent sexual assaults committed on her during the period of her detention. It must have been a terrifying and excruciating experience for Kylie. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent was apprehended by police when he returned to his flat to dispose of the body. The body had been found by the police in the flat, and the victim’s mother was present when the body was found.” 
        
       
      
    13 Fuller descriptions of the respondent’s crime appear in the original remarks on sentence of Wood J, substantial extracts from which were quoted by Barr J in his reasons for redetermination. These reasons should be examined. 
     
      
    14 As his Honour observed, there are special provisions in Schedule 1 relating to non release recommendation. Such is defined to include observation or opinion expressed by a sentencing judge that an offender should never be released from imprisonment. Where such has been made, special reasons are required to justify the substitution of a determinate sentence (cl 2 (3)) and the offender is inhibited from making an application for a specified period. As at the date of the lodgement of this application by the respondent (2 April 2001) the inhibitory period was twenty years. By amendment with effect from 20 July 2001 this period was extended to thirty years.  
     
      
    15 Neither provision came into effect as Wood J had made no observation that would amount to a relevant non release recommendation, however Barr J commented: 
     
      
       
        
        “Special provisions appear in the Schedule to deal with cases the subject of what is called a non-release recommendation. They are cases in which a recommendation or observation was made at the time of sentencing to the effect that the offender should never be released from imprisonment. It should be noted that notwithstanding his Honour’s strong observations about the serious nature of the applicant’s crime and the poor case that he personally presented, his Honour stopped short of making any recommendation or observation of that kind. On the contrary, it appears from the closing passages of his Honour’s judgment, extracted above, that his Honour held out the hope that the applicant’s personality might change and that he might modify his behaviour and accept his criminality. Implicit in his Honour’s remarks was an acceptance that in those circumstances the applicant ought to have an opportunity to earn his release from custody on parole or licence.” 
        
       
      
    16 The relevant content of the remarks by Wood J included: 
     
      
       
        
        “….I wish to have recorded that the sentence I regard as appropriate for the prisoner is such as to require very careful consideration by the authorities in relation to his future custody and in particular as to whether he should be, at any time in the future, returned back to the community. My assessment in this regard is based upon the most careful and dispassionate analysis of the crime charged and the prisoner’s personal profile. 
        
       
       
        
        There are matters in this case which I regard as of very great concern. They include the total lack of contrition expressed by the prisoner, his callous attitude towards the parents of his victim and his obvious lack of insight into and acceptance of his wrongdoing. 
        
       
       
        
        Additionally, there is his refusal to discuss with the psychologists and psychiatrists the matters concerning his sexual attitudes and his state of mind in that regard, when carrying out the sexual violation of his victim. The material available leaves me with the view that this prisoner at this time presents a very grave danger to the community, in particular to young children. 
        
       
       
        
        While once again I do not mean by these remarks to fetter the discretion of any relevant Board entrusted with a decision as to the future release of him back to the community, I would be remiss in my duty not to have these observations recorded, since I have had the special opportunity to assess the prisoner at the time he comes up for sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        It may be that after a lengthy period of imprisonment and counselling a fundamental change in his personality and ability to modify his behaviour, together with an acceptance of his criminality, may emerge. Hopefully, that will be the case and it is proper that he be given the advantage of further psychiatric counselling and assistance while he serves his sentence.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is well known that prior to the Sentencing Act 1989, judges from time to time expressed opinion that a particular prisoner should never be released. Whether couched in language of recommendation or otherwise, such expressions were, at the time and until the legislation of Schedule 1, without any legal effect. It can also be recognized that whatever the circumstances, some judges considered it inappropriate to include any such expression in their sentencing remarks. This practice was later supported in R v Jamieson & Ors 1992 60 A Crim R 68 where Gleeson CJ (Hope AJA and Lee AJ concurring) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…where the offender is a young person, and there are so many possibilities as to what might happen in the future, it is normally not appropriate for a sentencing judge to seek to anticipate decisions that might fall to be made by other persons, and in other proceedings, or under other legislation, over the ensuing decades. For that reason, I should indicate that I do not support the recommendation made by Newman J. This is not intended to be a recommendation by me that either appellant should be released at some time in the future. It is simply intended as an expression of my view that the making of any recommendation on that subject in these circumstances is not appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    18 Of course, Wood J sentenced the respondent prior to that decision but the fact that he refrained from making a recommendation that the respondent never be released, which he might be taken to appreciate was devoid of legal effect does not, in my view, imply a finding that, if the respondent could change and accept his criminality, he should necessarily have the prospect of release held out to him. 
     
      
    19 Insofar as his Honour made findings they were, as stated, lack of contrition, callous attitude to the parents of the victim, lack of insight into and acceptance of wrongdoing. As the first extract from his Honour’s remarks on sentence articulates, change for the better was assessed as a hope based upon a possibility. There is nothing that I perceive in the remarks by Wood J which indicated a view that the respondent ought to have the opportunity to earn release on licence or parole, rather than that these were matters to be assessed by others. 
     
      
    20 It is apt, in any event, to consider whether the respondent has “earned” the opportunity postulated by Barr J. His Honour has cited lengthy extracts from the reports from psychiatrists and psychologists, and referred to the giving of evidence by some of them. There is no need to repeat the recitation and it will suffice to recount the findings which his Honour made which were significantly derived therefrom: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. This body of evidence establishes that since his first application the applicant has made progress towards an acknowledgement of his wrongdoing. Wood J’s concern about the applicant’s lack of frankness in his discussions about the offence has been met to a considerable extent. 
        
       
       
        
        12. From an uncertain beginning in 1995 has emerged a frank acknowledgement that the applicant’s crime had a serious sexual side to it. It is correct to point out, as the Crown does, that the applicant still does not acknowledge the full horrific extent of his attack on Kylie, and that that is an indicator that the applicant has some way to go before achieving full remorse for his crime. I do think, however, that there is a process going on in the applicant’s mind and that, given participation in the intensive course of which I shall speak, he will probably come to a full acknowledgement of his criminality. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The applicant has completed a preliminary course of low intensity, designed for sexual offenders, and wishes to enter into the CUBIT program, a ten-month intensive course conducted in Sydney. That course identifies for each offender the things which give rise to the risk of reoffending and teaches the offender how to recognise those risks and guard against them. 
        
       
       
        
        14. The applicant is now aged 40 years. He is of average intelligence. Dr Lucas, Dr Wong and Ms Robilliard agree that he is willing to enter the CUBIT program and that he has the capacity to see it through. They agree that his continued rehabilitation would be promoted by his participation in the program. In fact they all think it necessary. 
        
       
       
        
        15. The applicant has the support of his daughter, with whom he has regular contact, and of certain other members of his family. 
        
       
       
        
        16. In my view, if he is to be granted a determinate sentence and a non-parole period, the public’s best interests will be served if he enters the CUBIT program at the earliest possible opportunity. 
        
       
       
        
        17. I accept the opinions of Drs Lucas and Wong that the applicant’s risk of reoffending is significantly lower than at any time hitherto. I accept that if the applicant completes the CUBIT program the risk of his reoffending will continue to lessen. I think that the stage is achievable at which the applicant will be able to be released into the community under supervision without unacceptable risk to the community. 
        
       
       
        
        18. The Crown submitted that the offence fell into the worst category of offences and that on that account this application should be dismissed. It would follow, if that were the correct view of the matter, that the applicant ought to be ordered never to reapply for a determinate sentence or a non-parole period. I do not accept the Crown submission. I am bound to take into account his Honour’s remarks in sentencing, delivered almost nineteen years ago, which even then held out the hope of a change in the applicant’s personality, a modification of his behaviour and an acceptance of his criminality. His Honour’s hopes, it seems to me, are on the way towards being realised. 
        
       
       
        
        19. I am bound to take into account his Honour’s awareness at the time of sentence of the applicant’s eligibility for release on parole and the practice that then existed in the issue of licences. In that connection, I note his Honour’s express desire not to fetter the discretion of those who would decide such things. I note also the implication in his Honour’s order shortening the time for a further application that a determinate sentence was likely to result if the applicant made satisfactory progress. The applicant has accepted the opportunity he was offered. 
        
       
       
        
        20. Like his Honour, I do not think that the offence fell into the worst category, so as to require the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for the rest of the applicant’s life. Although the offence was a very grave one, it was a single offence and it was committed by a young and immature man in response to a major stressor in his life. However, the offence was callous and brutal and a most serious one of its kind and merits an unusually long head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    21 CUBIT is an acronym for Custody Based Intensive Treatment. The therapeutic manager of the programmes, David Bright, gave evidence before Barr J. He testified that different programmes are run for “different levels of risks and needs of offenders”, high, moderate and lower intensity. A high intensity programme lasts about ten months “depending on progress”. 
     
      
    22 It should be noted that Wood CJ at CL, when refusing the application in 1999 referred to the “yet to be tested change in the applicant from an attitude of denial and resistance, in a worst case of murder, to one of possible hope for the future.” 
     
      
    23 None of the evidence before Barr J revealed that such a change had been achieved. As above quoted, his Honour considered that the respondent would “probably come to a full acknowledgement of his criminality”. The respondent has not entered the CUBIT programme and any beneficial effect of it on him remains speculative. What were categorized as “hopes” for changes in personality, modification of behaviour and acceptance of criminality have reached the stage of being “on the way” to being realised. (My emphasis.) 
     
      
    24 I interpolate that I acknowledge the claimed existence of a practical hurdle confronting the respondent concerning entry into a CUBIT programme as it is apparently administered by the Corrective Services authorities, and as advanced by senior counsel on his behalf. Even assuming that such administration would exclude the respondent from the programme unless he has achieved a determinate sentence, I do not consider that that handicap is a matter which can be determinative that such a sentence should be imposed in lieu of a life term. 
     
      
    25 I return to his Honour’s findings. Obviously they are in a large part necessarily based upon prediction. The taking into account of such considerations does not lie outside the bounds of his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    26 In terms of clause 6(4)(b) to Schedule 1, this was unquestionably a most serious case of murder, but it was, as above quoted, his Honour’s view that the public interest would be best served by the entry of the respondent into a CUBIT programme at the earliest opportunity, and this would imply an opinion that it was not in the public interest that either of the directions contemplated by the clause (never to re-apply or not to re-apply for over three years) should be given. 
     
      
    27 The evidence of the psychologist Ms Robilliard in her report of 15 March 2005 postulated a sequence of completion of the programme before consideration of determination of sentence. She wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before this man can be considered for determination of sentence he should have the opportunity to do the CUBIT programme and his response would be a major factor in any future consideration. As Roger Blake pointed out in his last report (22.3.02), on static measures (the respondent) is still ‘a high risk individual’ and those measures by their nature will never change. What must be taken into consideration alongside those factors are the dynamic factors that can and do change an individual’s prognosis. 
        
       
       
        
        1. Over the past four to five years in particular (the respondent) has moved toward a more realistic and insightful view of himself and his behaviour in the offence in question. He accepts it was a sexual offence not just a violent/angry offence and he seems to be deeply distressed about the sadistic nature of his behaviour. This may point toward a more realistic understanding of his offence and his behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        2. (The respondent) is making attempts to be in contact with people from the outside community and tries to keep himself informed and up to date. He attends men’s groups and church fellowship meetings weekly particularly for this purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        3. (The respondent) has welcomed and built upon supports offered by his immediate family, notably his daughter Vanessa, his ex-wife, his sister Jennifer and his brother Peter. He also appears to have dealt appropriately with the recent death of his father in 2003 and of his mother in 1995. Nor have the tragic suicides of his half brothers Gary in 2002 and Robert in 2003 seriously destabilised him. 
        
       
       
        
        Thank you for inviting me to comment on (the respondent’s) progress at this point. His current condition and presentation suggest that he is now moving in a positive direction. Whether or not he can ultimately be considered for release back into the community will largely depend on his response to intensive treatment in the CUBIT programme at Long Bay Gaol.” 
        
       
      
    28 However, given the content of opinion, it would provide a basis for present non determination but not for a direction that the respondent may never reapply. I do not conclude that error has been demonstrated by his Honour’s declining to make orders which would, in their effect, impose a life sentence on the respondent without prospect of parole.  
     
      
    29 The alternatives pressed by the Crown involved dismissal of the instant application and deferral of the ability of the respondent to apply again for longer than for three years prescribed in Schedule 1 or for that period. The respondent has been in actual custody for over twenty years. If deferral were to be considered, it can be appropriate to take into account the likely non parole period: see Wood CJ at CL 1 October 1999 @ par 66 and R v Kluska NSWSC unreported 18 December 1998. In turn, such a matter would need to be looked at in the light of any variation by this Court of the non parole period set by Barr J. 
     
      
    30 An extension of the period of inhibition against re-application beyond three years is subject to the same requirements as a direction that the respondent never re-apply (cl. 6(4)). The absence of error by Barr J in declining a direction of the latter character should produce a co-ordinate finding of absence of error in declining to direct the former. 
     
      
    31 The power of this Court to intervene is not enlivened by the formation of a view different from that of the first instance judge. The issues of non parole period and/or the prescribed three year deferral should be dealt with in the light of the outcome of the appeal against the fundamental decision to set a determinate sentence in lieu of the life term. 
     
      
    32 In my view, the Crown contentions in support of the appeal have been made good in two allied respects. His Honour’s final conclusions were expressed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I propose to fix a non-parole period which recognises the very serious nature of the offence and which will allow waiting and preparation time for entry to the next available program, the conduct of the CUBIT program itself and such other steps as are considered necessary to prepare the applicant for release on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        The application is granted. I set a term of the sentence of thirty-six years, commencing on 10 October 1985 and expiring on 9 October 2021. I set a non-parole period of twenty-four years. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 9 October 2009.” 
        
       
      
    33 The “serious nature” of the offence required reflection not only in the setting of a non parole period but in the fixing of head sentence. There is no indication that the head sentence of thirty six years reflected a finding that, at its expiry, the respondent would cease to present a risk to the community whose interests it is mandatory to take into account in any sentencing exercise. That this would be the consequence of a fixed term of head sentence was a critical ingredient of sentence assessment. At most, the opinions of experts categorize the risk which the respondent presents to the community as lower than that at the time of the offence. It was not otherwise quantified.  
     
      
    34 There was no evidence from which it could be deduced that the respondent would cease to be a danger to the community and should be able to move freely within it without supervision at the expiry of thirty six years or any other finite term. As recapitulated above, the situation at its highest manifested progress in that hopes for positive change were “on the way” to being realized. 
     
      
    35 The exceptional facility made available by clause 4 (1)(b) of Schedule 1 to decline to set a specified term (of head sentence) but to set a non parole period is patently designed to accommodate such circumstances. His Honour does not appear to have considered this option. It was put by senior counsel for the respondent that his Honour’s remark that “like his Honour (Wood CJ at CL), I do not think that the offence fell into the worst category so as to require the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for the rest of the applicant’s life” demonstrated that he had done so. I do not accept that submission. It is clear from context, particularly in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL, that the references are being made to the prospect of actual imprisonment for life and not to any potential of release to parole during the respondent’s lifetime. 
     
      
    36 As is the case in an appeal against sentence, this Court can intervene as specified in clause 8 of Schedule 1 and for the above reasons, I am of opinion that it should do so, and, in particular, it should consider the option of setting a non parole period but leaving the life sentence intact.  
     
      
    37 There are so many contingencies operating in connection with the forecasts of the respondent’s acceptance of responsibility and future behaviour that it would be unsafe, and contrary to the public interest in terms of safety, to fix a term which will, after the expiry of a finite number of years grant to him unsupervised liberty. Any judgment as to whether he should enjoy such potential liberty would have to be made on an assessment of demonstrated achievement rather than on “hoped for” progress.  
     
      
    38 The imprecisions of the forecasts surrounding the respondent are such that I do not perceive that a rational assessment should now be made that it would be appropriate to dismiss the application and defer the availability to reapply for three years or any other calculable term of years. Such term would be infected by a large measure of speculation. There is no reason to anticipate that this will not continue to be the case. 
     
      
    39 I am of a view that the overall circumstances require that it be concluded that the applicant should always remain subject to parole supervision if he is released.  
     
      
    40 The final issue concerns the setting of a non parole period of twenty four years. I am conscious, of course, that the expiry of the non parole period does not mean an actuality of release. It is received doctrine that “in a true sense the non parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considered that the crime committed calls for such detention”: Power v The Queen 1974 131 CLR 623 @ 628 and see also The Queen v Paivinen 1985 158 CLR 489 @ 495; The Queen v Watt 1988 165 CLR 474 @ 481. 
     
      
    41 The importation of the principles applicable to appeals pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by clause 8 of Schedule 1 involves the concepts of restraint in resentence which are applicable to successful Crown appeals generally. Whilst, I would myself probably have set a longer non parole period (whether or not imposing a determinate head sentence) I conclude that a principled application to resentence leads to a result that the order setting a non parole period made by Barr J should not be disturbed. The assessment lay within the bounds of his Honour’s discretionary judgment: cf R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359. 
     
      
    42 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Redetermination of sentence by Barr J quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof, it be ordered that the application to set a specific term for the sentence imposed by Wood J on 22 December 1986 be declined but pursuant to clause 4 (1)(b) to Schedule 1 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       there be set a non parole period of twenty four years to date from 10 October 1985 and to expire on 9 October 2009. 
       
      4. It be specified that the earliest date upon which the respondent would become eligible for release to parole be 9 October 2009. 
       
      
    43 As I am aware of the continuing interest in and presence at these proceedings of other members of the victim’s family I stress that the effect of the orders which I have proposed does not mean the actual release of the respondent upon expiry of the non parole period and further, if he is at some time after that expiry released to parole, he will remain liable, upon breach of parole condition, to be returned to custody for a period up to the term of his natural life.

      JUDGMENT - Application on behalf of the accused to exclude “admissions” made by the accused to Messrs Ahmad and Altaf. 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused is charged with a series of offences under the Anti-Terrorism provisions of the Criminal Code Act (Commonwealth) 1995. 
     
      
    2 There has been a series of extensive pre-trial applications relating, inter alia, to the admissibility of evidence sought to be led at the trial. One of the issues arose very late in the piece, shortly before the jury was empanelled and prior to the Crown opening. This issue related to evidence given on 22 March 2006 by two witnesses during earlier pre-trial applications. The evidence had been given without objection at that time. Mr Boulten SC indicated shortly before empanelment that he now wished to object to the evidence being led at trial. On 1 May 2006, after hearing extended argument, I ruled that I would allow the evidence to be admitted but only on a limited basis. These are my reasons. 
     
      
    3 The circumstances surrounding the evidence may be briefly stated. A significant issue in the trial of the accused is his relationship with one Willie Brigitte. There is evidence to show that between May and October 2003, the accused was in contact with Willie Brigitte in circumstances where, the Crown maintains, there was established a covert or illicit relationship between them. The Crown says, for example, that the accused established a mobile phone service in a false name and that one of the purposes for this was to enable contact to be made with Brigitte. In addition, the Crown case is that the accused may have assisted Willie Brigitte upon his arrival in Australia and that, when Brigitte had obtained accommodation, the accused visited him at those premises in Boorea Avenue Lakemba. 
     
      
    4 It is further the Crown case that a resident at those premises, Mr Altaf, was able to recognise and identify the person he flatted with for a period of time in the middle of 2003. This, “identification” was of Willie Brigitte, although he was known to Altaf by a different name. 
     
      
    5 Mr Altaf had a friend, Rashid Ahmad. Ahmad also visited the premises on occasions and he purported to identify Willie Brigitte from a photo shown to him.  
     
      
    6 In addition to their “identification” of Willie Brigitte, each man gave evidence about visitors who came to the flat in the middle of 2003. On one occasion, two men came to see the person now identified as Willie Brigitte. One of them was known to each of Messrs Ahmad and Altaf. He was described as, the “halal butcher from Lakemba”. The identification of this person showed him to be one Abdul Rakib Hasan. This person was said to have been in contact on a number of occasions in 2003 with Willie Brigitte. He was also known to the accused. 
     
      
    7 The evidence in dispute related to the anticipated evidence at trial of Messrs Ahmad and Altaf concerning the second man who came to visit Willie Brigitte in company with the butcher. Ahmad described him as “clean shaven”. He said that the man told him his name was Faheem; he said he was “in architecture” and “working in the city somewhere”; and that he was from Sialkot in the State of Punjab, close to Lahore. 
     
      
    8 Mr Altaf said he overheard a conversation between the same man and his friend Ahmad, presumably on the same occasion. He said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, he told Mallick that he is from Pakistan, Sialkot, the city name, and I think he told us that he worked in the city as a architect somewhere. Yeah, that’s all”. 
        
       
       
      Submissions by counsel 
       
      
    9 Initially, the Crown had sought to press the tender of the evidence now in dispute on the basis that, although the evidence was contrary to the hearsay rule set out in s 59 of the Evidence Act 1995, it was admissible nevertheless, under s 81(1) of the Act. This was on the basis that it constituted an admission by the accused. 
     
      
    10 Mr Boulten SC took issue with the tender of the material on this basis. He argued that it was not an admission for two reasons. First, that it was not reasonably open to the Court to find (in terms of s 88 of the Evidence Act) that the statements had been made by the accused. In this regard, Mr Boulten argued that the statements themselves could not be used for this purpose and there would need to be other evidence from which the Court could find it reasonably open that the statements were made by the accused. Secondly, Mr Boulten argued that the statements were not adverse to the accused’s interest in the proceedings. 
     
      
    11 The Crown at first simply took issue with each of these arguments advanced on behalf of the accused. It maintained that the hearsay statements could, together with other evidence, be material from which the Court might determine that it was reasonably open to find the statements had been made by the accused. Later, however, the Crown advanced a second basis of admissibility for the evidence. This was a submission that the evidence was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule because of the provisions of ss 65(1) and 65(2)(c) of the Evidence Act. Section 65 applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. The Crown submits that it was the accused who made the previous representation and he is not “available” within the meaning of the Act (s 17(2) of the Evidence Act; and Clause 4 Part 2 of the Dictionary). In those circumstances, s 65(2)(c) creates an exception to the hearsay rule where a representation had been made in circumstances that “make it highly probable that the representation is reliable”. 
     
      
    12 Mr Boulten SC countered these submissions by asserting that the Crown still faced the same hurdle it had faced when it first sought to tender the material as admissions made by the accused. Mr Boulten said that the Crown could still not prove that it was the accused who made the representations. Indeed, he argued the Crown’s case is more difficult under this section because it is no longer a matter of determining whether it is reasonably open to find that it was the accused who made the statements. Rather, the Crown must prove that the representations were made by the accused having regard to the standard of proof in s 142 of the Evidence Act, namely proof on the balance of probabilities (s 142(1)(b). 
     
      
    13 The Crown’s response to this argument here again called in aid the provisions of Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary in the Evidence Act. Clause 4(1)(e) or (f) may have application according to the Crown. The relevant parts of the Clause are in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “4(1) For the purpose of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:… 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) all reasonable steps have been taken by the parties seeking to prove the person is not available to find the person or to secure his or her attendance but without success; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) all reasonable steps have been taken by the parties seeking to prove the person is not available to compel the person to give the evidence but without success”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The Crown argues that whether the person who made the representations was the accused or whether it was some other unknown person, he is in either event “not available”, having regard to the provisions of Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary. For that reason, s 65 is “triggered” and the provisions of s 65(2)(c) come into play. The Crown then submitted that the representations, occurring as they did during a friendly social encounter, satisfied the test in s 65(2)(c) of the Act 
     
      
    15 In its final submissions, the Crown then referred to the fact that Mr Ahmad had in fact “identified” the accused from a photograph as the person who was in attendance with the halal butcher on the day in question. This evidence had emerged during a preliminary hearing concerning a related issue as to whether the photo identification of the accused and others should be excluded under s 137 and s 138 of the Evidence Act. The Crown submitted that it was possible, and indeed appropriate, for the Court to regard this pre-trial evidence as evidence going to the admissibility of the representations in dispute here. The Crown maintained that this would be so either on the basis of the argument centred on s 81 of the Evidence Act or the argument under s 65(2)(c) of the Act. 
     
      
    16 Mr Boulten SC accepted that the evidence of Mr Ahmad as to identification had been admitted for pre-trial purposes associated with whether the photographic identification should or should not be excluded from the trial. It had not, however, been admitted for pre-trial purposes relating to the present argument. In those circumstances, Mr Boulten objected to the pre-trial tender in relation to the present application and supported his objection by the same arguments he had raised under ss 135 and 137 in the original argument. This rather complicated situation became even more problematic because, during the course of the “identification” pre-trial application, the Crown ultimately announced that it would not seek to tender the photographic identification by Mr Ahmad of the accused at the trial. The Crown, however, persisted with its proposal to tender at trial Mr Ahmad’s identification of Brigitte and Hasan and that evidence was allowed. For that reason, it became unnecessary to determine the exclusion application, at least so far as it related to Ahamd’s identification of the accused. 
     
      
    17 Amidst the maelstrom of these conflicting arguments and counter arguments, it is necessary to mention one further proposition that was debated between the Court and the parties: It was suggested during argument that the proper basis on which the Crown might tender the material in contest was this: it was not sought to prove the truth of the statements said to have been made by the second visitor to Ahmad and Altaf but simply to prove that those statements had been made and made by that visitor. It seemed to me, as I said during the debate, that it was at least arguable that the true basis of the Crown tender was to get into evidence the fact that the statements had been made by the visitor rather than the truth of those statements. I asked the parties to consider whether they would be prepared to agree to the evidence being received on this basis coupled with a limitation order under s 136 of the Evidence Act. (Such an order would have the effect of ensuring that s 60 of the Act did not operate so as to make the hearsay rule inapplicable to the statements that the visitor had made in the presence of the two witnesses). Mr Boulten SC positively objected to this proposition and, it must be said, the Crown while not rejecting it, offered rather lukewarm support, preferring to rely on its two principal arguments. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
       
      Is the evidence of Messrs Ahmad and Altaf admissible as an “admission”? 
       
      
    18 An “admission” is a previous representation that is made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding) and is adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceedings (Evidence Act Dictionary Part 1). 
     
      
    19 The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of an admission (s 81(1) Evidence Act). 
     
      
    20 The hearsay rule is contained in s 59(1) of the Evidence Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact.” 
        
       
      
    21 A previous representation is defined in the Dictionary to mean “a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced”.  
     
      
    22 The defence argument, in relation to the present matter, it will be recalled, is that it is not reasonably open for the Court to conclude that the alleged admission was made by the accused. Secondly, it cannot be said that the remarks made by the second man were adverse to the accused’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding. Although it was not argued by Mr Boulten SC on his client’s behalf, it seems to me that the first point may have a degree of application to the second limb of the argument. By this I mean that if it is not reasonable to find that the admission was made by the accused, can it in any event be said that the statements were in the sense contemplated by the section be “adverse” to the accused’s interest in the outcome to the proceeding? The reason why the issue arises as to whether it is reasonably open to conclude that the admission was made by the accused is because of the provisions of s 88 of the Evidence Act. This is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “88. For the purposes of determining whether evidence of an admission is admissible the Court is to find that a particular person made the admission if it is reasonably open to find that he or she made the admission”. 
        
       
      
    23 In Cross on Evidence (6th Australian Edition), the learned author makes the point that this section “relaxes the standard of proof”. The further point is made, however, namely that the “finding” that a person made an admission where it is reasonably open to do so is not a finding that is made for all purposes. Rather it is only for “the purpose of determining whether evidence of an admission is admissible”. If it is admitted, the question for the tribunal of fact will remain: was it made? If it was not made, it will be disregarded (para 35640). 
     
      
    24 The critical question here is whether the representations alleged to have been made by the second man in the premises at Lakemba may themselves be relied upon so as to lead to a finding (“reasonably open to find”) that the statements were made by the accused. After all, the Crown argued, the accused’s name was Faheem; he was at that time an architect working in the city; and he came from the City of Sialkot near Lahore. 
     
      
    25 The argument presented by the Crown however relied first upon other material apart from the representations themselves. This is evidence that the butcher from Lakemba and the accused were known to each other; that the butcher was in telephone contact (as was the accused) with Willie Brigitte on a number of occasions; and that the accused and Willie Brigitte were at other times in telephone contact with a “mutual acquaintance” in Pakistan. 
     
      
    26 In my view, this body of evidence, taken by itself, could not go so far as to lead to a conclusion that it is reasonably open to find it was the accused who was present in the Lakemba house and that it was he who had made the representations. The Crown did not argue to the contrary. 
     
      
    27 The remaining critical body of evidence is that contained in the representations themselves and in their truth, if they are to be admitted as exceptions to the hearsay rule.  
     
      
    28 Initially, no authority was cited by either side in relation to this point. Free from authority, it seems plain to me that the representations cannot be used for the purposes of making a finding that it was the accused who may have made the admissions constituted by the representations. There are essentially two reasons for this. First, it would be entirely circular to make use of the statements by the second man for this purpose. If there be no evidence beyond the representations themselves from which it might reasonably be open to find the statements were made by the accused, the conclusion they were or might have been made by him can only be reached by accepting the truth of the statements and by proceeding on the assumption that they were made by him. For example, if a person not identified in proceedings against John Smith had said to another “I am John Smith”, that without more would not be an admission that the person was John Smith unless one assumed the truth of the statement and, in addition, assumed that it was the John Smith on trial.  
     
      
    29 Moreover, by accepting the truth of the statements and making the relevant assumption in the present proceedings, it would be quite unnecessary to place reliance on the representations themselves to prove it was the accused who was at the Boorea Avenue premises. As a matter of logic, the accused’s presence at the house in Lakemba will have already been accepted before turning to the representations themselves to see whether they can establish that fact relevant to a fact in issue. 
     
      
    30 Secondly, assuming, as I do, that the statements made by the second man were consistent with the background and occupation of the accused, they do not prove of themselves that it he who made the statements. It would still be necessary for the tribunal of fact to draw inferences in relation to either the statements or the truth of the statements and to place those inferences along side other known evidence before making a deduction or drawing an inference that it was or was not the accused who was present in the house.  
     
      
    31 Later in the argument, Mr Lange, junior counsel for the accused, properly and fairly, drew my attention to a decision of the English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) given on 20 December 2000. The decision did not favour the defence argument. The case is that of Regina v Ward, Andrews and Broadley. In the trial, a point had been taken as to the admissibility of certain police evidence on the basis that it was hearsay. On three occasions in 1999, when stopped by police, the occupants in a certain motor vehicles had been asked to identify themselves. A passenger in those cars on the three occasions gave his name as “Michael Kevin Ward”, gave his date of birth and gave his address. The date of birth and the address were identical with those of the appellant Ward. The police officer who could provide the evidence of these conversations could not however independently identify the appellant Ward as a passenger in the motor car on the three occasions. The argument before the Court of Appeal in its Criminal Division was that the evidence of the conversations was hearsay and thus inadmissible. Lord Justice Waller with (whom Mr Justice Douglas Brown and his Honour Judge Stephens QC agreed) said at paras 37-40: - 
     
      
       
        
        “37. Prime facie thus it would appear that the police officer’s evidence was hearsay. However, it is an exception to the hearsay rule that any statement, wholly or partly adverse to the defendant’s interests, may be given in evidence. The matter is governed by s 76 of The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but was also the position at common law. 
        
       
       
        
        38. There is, as Mr Butt accepted on behalf of the Crown, an obvious circularity in the argument that in the instant case an admission was being relied on because it is the very evidence which might be infringing the hearsay rule which is being relied on to establish the admission. It is, we have to say, somewhat puzzling that there appears to be no authority dealing directly with this point, which, it would seem likely, has arisen on numerous occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        39. It is an unattractive proposition that where someone identifies himself as compellingly as was done in this case by the appellant Ward, that he can object to that evidence being put before the jury at all and then not give evidence so as to expose himself to cross-examination in relation to the question whether he was present in that motor car on the particular day. Equally, the application of the hearsay rule and the dangers from which it protects defendants must at all times be borne in mind. 
        
       
       
        
        40. We are of the view that the answer to the conundrum lies in the quality of the identification evidence which is being given. Thus, if as in this case, a man is giving his full name, is giving a date of birth which is the date of birth of the person with that full name, and is giving an address which is the address of the person with that full name, the evidence is strong to establish an admission. If, in addition, as in the case of the evidence relating to the date 9 June 1999 there is evidence which supports part-ownership of the motor car in the appellant Ward, that gives further support to such evidence.” 
        
       
      
    32 With every respect to the English Court of Appeal, I do not think that the reasoning in the case can be correct or that it should be followed. Indeed, the reasoning highlights the circularity of the use sought to be made of the evidence. To say that the appellant Ward had “identified himself compellingly” is to beg the question entirely. Nor do I think that the evidence can be said to be “strong to establish the admission” merely because the statements reflect the date of birth of the accused and his address. Again, this assumes not only that the person who made the statements was the accused, it also assumes that the person who made the statements was not fabricating the information conveyed so as to protect himself and implicate an otherwise innocent person. I agree (as I will discuss later) that evidence of this kind may have a utility as tending towards the identification of person who made the statements but it cannot be assumed for the purposes of deciding whether it is an admission by the accused that the statements were made by the accused merely because they reflect some personal characteristics he or she may have possessed. Therein lies the circularity. Of course, in the English decision there was in addition an extra feature, namely the appellant’s part-ownership of one of the cars. But as to the logic itself, I regret to say that I remain unpersuaded. 
     
      
    33 Subject to the fate of the later argument that Mr Ahmad had in fact identified the person present at the Lakemba premises as the accused based on a photograph he had been shown, I consider that the Crown has not otherwise established that the representations were made by the accused so as to make them admissible as admissions. Putting the matter more precisely, I am unable to conclude that it is reasonably open to find that it was the accused who made the admissions. In reaching that conclusion, I put to one side the representations themselves for the reasons I have stated. Whether the photographic “identification” is sufficient to alter the situation is a matter I will leave for further consideration after I have determined the arguments based on s 65(2)(c) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    34 The findings I have made make it strictly speaking unnecessary to consider whether, assuming it were open to find they were made by the accused, the representations may be said to be “adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding”. This definition has however been given a wide interpretation by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. It can, for example, include a lie told by an accused if it is relied upon by the Crown at trial R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; or an exculpatory statement R v Houghton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. Here, where the issue is whether the accused was present at the Lakemba premises on the relevant date, it seems to me that the representations may properly be described as “adverse” in the sense that the expression appears in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Is the evidence of Messrs Ahmad and Altaf admissible as a consequence of ss 65(1) and 65(2)(c) of the Evidence Act? 
       
      
    35 Section 65, as I have earlier recited, applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
     
      
    36 An asserted fact is defined in s 59 of the Evidence Act. I have earlier set out the provisions of s 59 at para 20 in this decision. A previous representation about an asserted fact is not confined to the alleged crime itself (R v Ambrosoli [2002] 55 NSWLR 603 at 614; R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 108). 
     
      
    37 Section 65(2)(c) provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was made in circumstances that it make it highly probable that the representation is reliable. 
     
      
    38 I have earlier set out the provisions of Clause 4 Part 2 of the Dictionary and in particular sub-paragraphs (e) and (f). I have also pointed to s 17(2) of the Evidence Act which is relied upon for the proposition that the accused himself is not “available” within the meaning of s 65(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    39 The learned author of Cross on Evidence (6th Australian Edition) makes it clear that s 65(2)(c) was not recommended by the ALRC or the NSWLRC. In so far as it makes reliability an avenue of admissibility, it departs from classical evidence theory although the departure is sanctioned in some High Court statements and also by the Supreme Court of Canada. The relationship between “high probability” and the conventional criminal and civil standards (ss 140 and 141) is unclear (para 35500). 
     
      
    40 The precise way in which s 65(2)(c) of the Act is to operate has been clarified by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. The circumstances that are to be examined to determine the high probability that a particular representation is reliable are the circumstances of the making of the representation. The focus remains the reliability of the representation, not (directly) the reliability of the asserted fact. Evidence of events other than those of the making of the previous representation may however throw light upon the circumstances of the making of that representation and its reliability as affected thereby. (R v Ambrosoli (at 615). At page 34 Mason P (with whom Hulme and Simpson JJ agreed) said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It would therefore appear that  
        R v Mankotia 
         (Sperling J 27 July 1998 unreported);  
        Conway v The Queen 
         (2000) 98 FCR 204 at 244; and  
        R v Williams 
         (2000) 119 A Crim 490 at 503-505 are at one in: - 
        
       
      
    · focussing upon the circumstances of the making of the previous representation to determine whether it is unlikely that the representation was a fabrication or highly probable that the representation was reliable; and 
     
      
    · excluding evidence tending only to prove the asserted fact. 
     
      
       
        
        In my view this is the correct approach to s 65(2) to the extent that  
        R v Dean 
         and  
        R v Lock 
         decide otherwise they should not be followed.” 
        
       
      
    41 Mason P allowed however that prior or later statements or conduct of the person making the previous representation are only to be considered to the extent that they touch the reliability of the circumstances of the making of that previous representation. If they do no more than tend to address the asserted fact or ultimate issues they have no bearing on the issues presented by s 65(2) (see para 36 at page 616). 
     
      
    42 Section 67 of the Evidence Act requires that notice be given (“reasonable notice in writing”) where reliance is placed on s 65(2) of the Act. Notice in fact was not given until 28 April 2006 but no objection in this regard has been taken on behalf of the accused. 
     
      
    43 There is little doubt that, if it were the accused who made the representations at the Lakemba household, he is not available in the Crown case to give evidence about the asserted facts. (R v Parkes [2003] 147 A Crim R 450 at 459). But the real question is – has it been shown that it was the accused who made the previous representations? There is no doubt, of course, that both Mr Ahmad and Mr Altaf heard or otherwise perceived the representations being made. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion, subject once again to the issue of the photographic identification by Ahmad of the accused, the Crown has not established that it was the accused who made the representations. 
     
      
    45 First, there is the general evidence which I have earlier identified. This of course shows there was an association between the accused, the butcher from Lakemba and Willie Brigitte. But it says little as to whether the accused was the person in the Lakemba premises on the day in question. As to the statements themselves, they cannot in my view be used for the purpose of demonstrating that it was the accused who made the representations. This follows from the analysis I have made in relation to the previous argument based on ss 81 and 88 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    46 Once again, if the assumption be made that the representations must have been made by the accused, there would be no need to consider the circumstances of their making so as to evaluate reliability. The issue is – was the accused in the Lakemba house on the relevant day? If one assumes that it must have been he who made the statements based on the nature of what was said, why would there be any need to reflect upon what was said to prove his presence there? 
     
      
    47 The Crown has argued that the representations were made either by the accused or by some unknown person. The Crown’s real position of course, is that they were made by the accused. But if it be allowed that they were made by a person other than the accused, how could it be said, assuming the identity of that person is unknown, that the representations were made in circumstances that make it “highly probable” that the representations were reliable? In my opinion, unless it can be shown that it was the accused who made the representations, s 65(2)(c) will not be satisfied. 
     
      
    48 This leads me directly to the point involving the photographic identification. Mr Boulten had objected strenuously to this material being received on the basis that the circumstances required that the photographic identification of the accused be excluded under either ss 137 or 138 of the Evidence Act. Considerations of the fairness and propriety of those submissions were undoubtedly a factor in the Crown’s decision to announce that it would not seek to lead evidence of the photographic identification of the accused at trial. That position has not altered. 
     
      
    49 Is it appropriate, in those circumstances, to allow the photographic identification evidence to be admitted for the purposes of the present pre-trial application where the statements are sought to be led either under on s 81 or s 65(2)(c) of the Act? In my view, the answer to that question must be that it is not at all appropriate to do so. This is so for two reasons. First, the concept of allowing the evidence for a pre-trial purpose but not at trial strikes me as one that is generally inappropriate. It is certainly inappropriate in the present circumstances. Secondly, the admission of the evidence under s 65(2)(c) in circumstances where there is to be no evidence of the photographic identification at trial will leave the tribunal of fact in a position where, in my view, it will be unable to conclude that it was the accused who made the representations. This is so unless the tribunal of fact can rely on the truth of the representations themselves. Again, there is a degree of circularity involved in this process, which, to my mind, is impermissible. 
     
      
    50 The Crown, having fairly and properly determined that it will not lead the photographic identification of the accused at trial, should not be permitted to rely upon that same identification for the purposes of attempting to demonstrate at pre-trial that it was the accused who made these representations. 
     
      
       
      A third basis of admissibility 
       
      
    51 Although I have concluded that evidence of the representations should not be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, I have nevertheless come to a conclusion that the statements may be tendered in evidence before the jury as evidence of the fact that the statements were made and made by the person who was present in the Lakemba premises and accompanying the visitor described as the butcher from Lakemba. The one hesitation I have had in coming to this conclusion relates to the evidence of the representation by which the second visitor described himself as “Faheem”. The Crown, however, indicated during argument that it would not lead this aspect of the evidence from either Mr Ahmad or Mr Altaf. 
     
      
    52 The remaining statements appear to me to be statements that may be properly admitted as material relevant to the possible identification of the second visitor. The reasoning is simple: it is perhaps unlikely, unless the second visitor were pretending to be someone else or otherwise fabricating his statements, that the type of detail about his occupation and background would be known to any one other than the accused himself. This, of course, is no more than an inference that can be drawn from the making of the statements. It is by no means conclusive but it is a possible aid to identification based on the fact the statements were made by the second visitor. It is the making of the statements, not their truth that is relevant for this purpose. It may well be, for example, that when consideration is given to the whole of the evidence, including the making of the statements, the jury will find itself unable to draw the conclusion that the second visitor was in fact the accused. There is, for example, his physical appearance, which differs from that of the accused in that the visitor was clean-shaven. Moreover, it is not necessarily an unreasonable hypothesis that in a city of the size of Sydney there may be more than one person possessing the characteristics recorded by the visitor’s statements. 
     
      
    53 But I do not see that the fact that the statements were made by the second person that he was an architect, worked in the city; that he came from Sialkot in Pakistan cannot be used as evidence relevant to the identification of that person. To my mind, it is, as I have said, the statements themselves that are relevant in this way not the truth of those statements. If, after due consideration and the giving of appropriate directions, the jury were to reach a conclusion that, based on the whole of the evidence, it was the accused who was present in the Lakemba premises on the relevant day then it may well be that the finding will carry with it the notion that what was said by the person will have turned out to be truth. But the identification will have occurred not because of a reliance on the truth of the statements but because of reliance on the general body of identification evidence including the making of the statements themselves and that they were made by the person who was the second visitor. The distinction is a fine one, perhaps, but in my view it is a real distinction. 
     
      
    54 In Regina v Ward (at para 36) Lord Justice Waller was not persuaded that this distinction should be recognised. His Lordship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Butt sought to submit that this evidence was being put in by the prosecution to establish that the statement was made, but not the truth of the statement. That seems to us not a possible interpretation of the position. The evidence was clearly being put in to establish that it was the appellant Ward in the motor car at the relevant moment in time.” 
        
       
      
    55 I have no doubt the evidence here is sought to be “put in” to establish that it was the accused who was present in the Lakemba house on the day in question. But, with all respect, the path of reasoning does not travel from the truth of the statements to the conclusion suggested by the Crown. It is the making of the statements by the visitor that moves the inferential process forward or at least may tend to do so. This is because the making of the statements – the words that were spoken – have a possible relevance as identification material, in the same or at least a similar way that a physical feature (such as a tattoo, distinctive voice or unusual language) may be used for this purpose. It is also necessary to say that the jury will need to be told how they may use this evidence and how they may not. The possibility that the words were said by a person other than the accused will need to be pointed out to the jury and considered by them before coming to a conclusion. Once again, I will expect considerable assistance from the parties as to the framing of a proper direction. 
     
      
    56 I am also satisfied that there is no basis under ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence of the representations, provided the Crown does not lead the evidence relating to the name “Faheem”.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONJUSTICE ROTHMAN18 May 2006 
     
     NSW CRIME COMMISSION v Victor Warren OLLIS 
      
     10278/2006 
    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: A question of principle has been raised on the form of orders that should issue, which question raises the appropriateness of the orders usually made in proceedings under s.27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (“the Act”).2 On 21 April 2006, I issued reasons for judgment on the making of an order under s.27 of the Act, which reasons should be read together with these reasons.3 The earlier judgment indicated that appropriate orders under s.27 of the Act would be made because the preconditions for the making of such an order had been established. Once the preconditions for the order are established, the Court, subject to an adjournment or other course granted for proper reasons, is required to make the orders.4 In the judgment of 21 April 2006, I indicated that I would hear the parties on the form of orders that would issue. The matter was listed before me for that purpose at which hearing I was informed that agreement could not be reached. 
     
      
      Issue: Particularisation of illegal activity 
      
    5 The issue between the parties is whether every initial order issued by the Court must, as a result of the proper construction of the Act, especially s.27, specify the illegal activities from which the assets were derived.6 The submission of the first defendant is that a proceeds assessment order made by the Supreme Court must specify the illegal activity, or each of the illegal activities, that have occurred, from which the first defendant has, or may have, derived proceeds which would then be the subject of assessment.7 The difference in approach of the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the Commission”) and the first defendant is apparent from the terms of the orders each proposes. The Commission proposes:  
     
      
       
       “Pursuant to Rule 13.1 of the  
       Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 
        judgment be given for the Plaintiff on its claim for a proceeds assessment order against the First Defendant for an amount to be assessed by the Court.” 
        
       
      
    8 The Commission proposes further consequential directions that deal with the assessment process, which, for the purposes of the proposed Order, includes a determination of all of the illegal activities from which proceeds may have been derived.9 The first defendant, on the other hand, proposes the following order: 
     
      
       
       “Pursuant to s. 27 of the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, 
        the Court orders there be an assessment by the Court of the amount of the proceeds to the First Defendant of the illegal activity constituted by the filing by the First Defendant of false affidavits in proceedings in Wollongong Local Court on or about 21 December 2005.” 
        
       
      
     There are further proposed directions in or to the same effect as the consequential directions proposed by the Commission. Also, there is an Order expressly declaring that summary judgment has been granted. There is, however, no later adjudication of whether there are, beyond the serious crime related activity specified, any other illegal activities for which proceeds would be assessed.10 The Commission has, for the purpose of the proceedings, adduced only sufficient evidence to satisfy the conditions prescribed in s.27(2) of the Act. It is and was its intention to deal with the determination of illegal activity, if any, during the assessment process, which it understood would occur after the initial orders. It has not adduced evidence of illegal activity, if there were any, other than the serious crime related activity on which it relied to satisfy s.27(2) of the Act. It is necessary to examine the scheme of the Act so far as is relevant and to recite the relevant provisions of the Act, which includes some of the definitions and some extracts of s.27 and s.28 of the Act. 
     
      
      Scheme of the Act 
      
    11 The Act contains the following relevant definition: 
     
      
       
       “illegal activity means: 
        
       a) a serious crime related activity; or 
        
       b) an act or omission that constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth…” 
       
      
    12 Section 6 of the Act defines serious crime related activity as conduct that was at the time “a serious criminal offence”. This phrase, in turn, is defined as a limited class of criminal activity.13 The purpose of the Act is partly described in its long title, which is an “Act to provide for the confiscation of interests in property that are interests of a person engaged in serious crime related activities; to enable proceeds of serious crime related activity to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown; and for other purposes.” The Act has other purposes. They include the confiscation of property from persons, not themselves engaged in serious crime, if the property is derived from crime: see, for example, s.9 and s.10(2)(b), s.10(3)(b), s.22(2A), s.26 and s.27(2A) of the Act.14 The scheme of the Act, relevantly, provides for restraining orders (s.10) to issue from the Supreme Court to stop dealings in property or interests in property where the property belongs to a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity, or, where the property, or the interest in the property, is suspected of being serious crime-derived property.15 The Supreme Court is required to make orders under s.10 if the application for such orders is supported by an affidavit of an officer, reciting the officer's suspicion, and if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion.16 By s.12 of the Act the Court may, either at the time that it makes an order or at any later time, vary the property described in any restraining order.17 Section 22 of the Act provides for the making of assets forfeiture orders. It requires the Court to make such an order if the Court finds that the person, whose suspected serious crime related activity formed the basis of the Restraining Order, was involved in certain serious crime related activities. The finding of the Court is on the balance of probabilities. Section 22 also requires the making of an assets forfeiture order in relation to an interest in property acquired in certain circumstances. An order made under s.22 of the Act, either against a person, engaged in the relevant activity in relation to her/his property, or against other persons in relation to property of such persons, which is serious crime-derived property, need not be based on a finding of a particular kind or the commission of a particular offence.18 Section 25 of the Act allows the Court to exclude property from a forfeiture order on the application of a person affected thereby and on proof, on the balance of probabilities, that the property is not property that ought to have been caught by an order originally made under s.22. 
     
      
       
      Proceeds Assessment Orders 
      
    19 The most relevant part of the Act for the purposes of these proceedings is Division 2, and in particular s. 27 and s.28 of the Act. It is necessary for me to reiterate some extracts of those sections. Subsection 27 (1) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “(1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay… an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person, … whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based.” 
       
      
    20 Section 28 is, relevantly, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “1) For the purpose of making an assessment under s.27 in relation to the proceeds derived by a person (in the section called  
       the defendant 
       ) from any illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person the Supreme Court is to have regard to the following matters: 
        
        a) the money, or the value of any interest in property other than money, directly or indirectly acquired by: 
         
          
          (i) the defendant, or 
           
          (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
          
         
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
         
        b) the value of any service, benefit or advantage provided for: 
         
          
          (i) the defendant, or 
           
          (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
         
        c) the market value...[ of the illegally utilised goods]… 
         
        d) the value of the defendant's property before and after… 
         
        e) the defendant's income and expenditure before and after the illegal activity or activities. 
        
       2) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order that the value of the defendant's property after an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the defendant exceeded the value of the defendant's property before the activity or activities, the Supreme Court is to treat the excess as proceeds derived by the defendant from the activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the excess was due to causes unrelated to an illegal activity or activities. 
        
       3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant's expenditure during the period, … the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities.’ 
       
      
      
    21 The defendant's submission is that the proper construction of s.27 requires the Court to specify, at the time of making an order under s.27, the activity or activities said to be illegal, which activities are capable of being assessed by the Court.22 The Commission agitates for a continuation of the practice that has been generally adopted by the Court, namely, the making of a general order requiring assessment, which assessment includes the determination of any and all illegal activities from which income was derived.23 The defendant refers to the opening words of ss.(2) and (3) of s.28 as a demonstration of a legislative intention that it is at the initial hearing that the illegal activity or illegal activities be specified. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    24 A proceeds assessment order may relate to illegal activities, which are activities beyond those defined as “serious crime related activity”.25 A proceeds assessment order under s.27 of the Act must be made upon proof, on the balance of probabilities, of the requirements of ss.27(2) of the Act. For an order to be made, the Court need not inquire into each and every illegal activity of the defendant. Of course, it may. But an “illegal activity” is not confined to serious crime related activities; it extends to other acts or omissions, being offences.26 The proceedings before the Court are civil in nature (see s.5 of the Act) and, subject to submissions of the parties and the interest of justice, the Court may deal with the subject matter of the proceedings in one or more separate hearings. Usually the Court hears and determines the initial liability of the defendant to an order, being the issue of whether the requirements of ss.27(2) have been satisfied. After hearing the parties, the Court, as another course, may determine all of the issues in one hearing. A third alternative is for the Court to have three hearings: a hearing to determine whether the preconditions in ss.27(2) have been satisfied; a hearing to determine each and every illegal activity; and, thirdly, a hearing to assess the proceeds of each such illegal activity.27 The opening words of ss.28(2) and (3) refer to the totality of the hearing process for the making of a final order, being a proceeds assessment order. On the other hand, the opening words of ss.28(1) of the Act make clear that a hearing may involve only the assessment process.28 There is no reason for s.27 and s.28 of the Act to be construed in a manner that would restrict the Court to the inconvenient process of hearing all evidence for each of the three aspects of the final orders at once. Were the Court's discretion so constrained, it would mandate a lengthening of proceedings unnecessarily and, in some instances, require a large amount of detailed evidence, on other illegal activities and the proceeds derived from them, in circumstances that do not satisfy the requirements of ss.27(2) of the Act.29 A proper construction of s.27 and s.28 of the Act requires the Court, in circumstances that satisfy ss.27(2), to make the relevant orders. Once the Court is satisfied under ss.27(2), the Court need not be satisfied of every detail required for the making of final orders before making any order. The Court is capable of dealing with the assessment process in a separate hearing and, likewise, it is capable of dealing, in a separate hearing, either at the same or a different time to the assessment hearing, with the determination of each and every illegal activity alleged.30 The above analysis recognises that the proceeds assessment order described in s.27(1) requires three major matters to be determined: the criteria in s.27(2) of the Act; the extent of any other illegal activity; and the proceeds from both such criminal activities. The Court may deal with each of these areas in one hearing or it may deal with one or both of the first two adumbrated matters separately and on an interlocutory basis. Traditionally, it has dealt with the s.27(2) criteria, at least, on an interlocutory basis. This is a sensible and convenient approach in the instant matter. 31 For the above reasons, I propose to make the orders sought by the Commission, which have been given to the Court and marked MFI 1, and, otherwise, adjourn the matter to a date convenient to the parties. I will hear the parties on the appropriate dates for the consequential orders.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner Daniel Lovoni appears today for sentence in relation to two offences which were committed on 6 June 2005. The first offence in time is an offence alleging that the accused on that date at Surry Hills did rob Mohammed Sultan of certain property, to wit a blue “Nokia” brand mobile phone the property of the said Mohammed Sultan whilst being in company with Andrew Carr and Amy Simon. The second offence in time, committed within twenty minutes of the first offence, is an allegation that he on 6 June 2005 at Surry Hills did break and enter the dwelling house of Mohammed Sultan situated at 2/96 Goodlet Street, Surry Hills and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, stealing, in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he did deprive the said Mohammed Sultan of his liberty.2 Each of these offences I am informed carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. There is no standard non parole in relation to the offence of robbery in company but there is a standard non parole period under Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in respect of the offence brought pursuant to s 112 (2) Crimes Act, that is the break and entering in circumstances of aggravation. In this matter the prisoner pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court in relation to both charges. Thus the standard non parole period is not directly relevant to the sentencing proceedings in accordance with the judgment of R v Way, as this is not a sentence after trial. However the standard non parole period may in appropriate circumstances be regarded as some guidepost or in extrinsic indicia of the standard of sentencing required for offences of this type. I will come back to that matter shortly.3 The facts of the matter are of course in any sentencing proceeding critical in assessing the objective gravity of the offences to be the subject of sentences.4 Shortly before 1am on 6 June 2005 the victim Mr Sultan was using a public phone somewhere near his premises in Surry Hills. He was approached by two young people Andrew Carr and Amy Simon, the persons identified in the charge. The prisoner Daniel Lovoni who is an older person, and I will deal with their respective ages shortly, was a few metres away. Both Carr and Simon aggressively approached the victim, Carr grabbed his shirt collar while Simon searched through his jacket, demanding his wallet and money. Property was removed from him as particularised in the charge.5 The Crown’s case against the prisoner Daniel Lovoni was that he was a principle in the second degree in respect of this offence. His presence and acquiescence, amounting to an assistance and encouragement of the offence that rendered its commission more likely. Having said that, there is no evidence before me that the prisoner actively participated in the robbery and I am quite satisfied on the totality of material available to me that he neither previously knew of the plan to rob Mr Sultan or gave any direction in that regard.6 The second offence in time arose out of the circumstance in which Mr Sultan, after being asked by Carr if he lived nearby, was escorted against his will to his property in a block of units. The victim opened the front door and allowed the offenders to walk in as he was extremely scared and frightened as to what would happen to him. Again it is clear that the prisoner did not take a leading role in the formulation of the plan to commit this crime. The offenders are said to have effected what is called a constructive break into the premises and that arose out of the threatening conduct towards the victim earlier. Once inside the unit the offenders, after closing the wooden door behind them, began it is said to ransack the unit, looking for cash and valuables. The victim shared the unit with a friend Mr Huynh who was also at home at the time.7 The facts revealed to me that Carr and Simon took a leading role in this ransacking. Carr searched cupboards, Simon entered the bedroom of Huynh, Simon removed property from the bedroom, at one stage calling out “I’ve got the wallets”. Carr entered the bedroom and punched Sultan in the face under the left eye with his right fist and then pushed Sultan in the chest causing him to fall to the bed. It is said in the facts specifically the striking of the victim by Carr was outside Lovoni’s contemplation in respect of the offence and the Crown does not allege this circumstance of aggravation against Lovoni.8 Various threats and demands were made by both Carr and Simon. There is no evidence of the prisoner being involved in the making of those threats. These two co-offenders continued their search. The one act of the prisoner contributing to the commission of the offence whilst inside the premises was the wheeling of a mountain bike belonging to Huynh in order to take the bike when he left.9 The Crown case against the prisoner is that he took part in the offence by encouraging its commission through his presence and by wheeling the mountain bike to the front door. It is quite clear on that concession by the Crown the prisoner can be seen to have a much lesser role than the two co-offenders.10 Mr Huynh, not unreasonably, eventually armed himself and ran at the three offenders. The three offenders ran from the unit and the victims ran after them. Eventually Simon was caught, or detained for a period of time by Sultan. Mr Lovoni escaped. Eventually Simon escaped although she was injured and eventually was admitted to hospital with injuries from her struggle with Mr Huynh.11 The police attended upon the home address of the prisoner later that same day. He was arrested and cautioned and according to the facts before me cooperated fully with the police. He immediately volunteered his involvement in the offences the previous night, he provided the police with the clothes that he had been wearing during the course of the offences. When taken to the police station he spoke freely with the police advising that he had smoked heroin and marijuana before the offence and that prior to the time of offending and at the time of offending he was in his words “off his head”.12 He explained the circumstances in which he met Simon and Carr having been at Ms Simon’s sister’s unit earlier that evening and confirmed that account in his evidence before me. The prisoner in the interview with police said that he was effectively accompanying Simon and Carr on that particular night and was not party to any agreement between the other two in relation to committing any offences on the way home. He gave detailed accounts of what happened, which are consistent with the facts alleged against him by the Crown. He denied taking any property out of the house and expressed his regret for his conduct and admitted his stupidity. A certain amount of property was recovered having been abandoned, or not carried away. There is no suggestion in the facts the prisoner was responsible for the identification and removal of the property which is shown in the facts.13 In his evidence before the Court the prisoner said in relation to the circumstances of the commission of the offence that he had known Amy Simon from school, although she was a year or two behind him. He had only known Andrew Carr for a short period before and at the time that he left the home of Simon’s sister, all he wanted to do was go home and was thus drawn into this offence in circumstances where he thought that was the plan of the co-accused.14 I should point out, as I foreshadowed earlier, that the co-accused as I understand it were arrested and charged. The precise details of what charges they faced I do not know but on the facts alleged by the Crown in this matter I would assume that they were charged with either similar or identical charges to the ones with which I am concerned. On one view of it they committed a more serious crime in relation to the break and enter offence given the striking of the victim for which the prisoner is not responsible. As I understand the matter with this inadequate information, Mr Carr who at the relevant time I am informed was sixteen years of age, was sentenced at the Bidura Children’s Court on 22 November 2005 to a twelve month control order with a six month non parole period commencing in September 2005. Simon was sentenced at the Bidura Children’s Court on 20 December 2005 and the offences apparently were generally adjourned with various conditions relating to her residence and her conduct and her association with others as well proposals in relation to her rehabilitation.15 The prisoner of course was older than these offenders. The prisoner was born as I understand it on 8 May 1984 and has just turned twenty-two years of age. He would have been twenty-one years of age at the time of the commission of the offences. I am not informed as to the criminal histories in detail of the co-offenders. I assume for the purposes of sentencing that their records if any are not as great as this particular offender.16 In relation to this offender’s criminal history his first charging, according to his criminal history, was in September 2003 for possessing a prohibited drug. The prisoner has had, I am quite satisfied from his evidence and other matters, a long history of involvement in the use of prohibited drugs and this is reflected in his criminal history. With regard to his use of drugs and alcohol, he started at a very young age, I am informed it was something of a reaction to very tragic circumstances relating to the death of a very close friend who was very badly burnt. This was a traumatic event for the prisoner and given his lifestyle and his associations it was not long before he was abusing alcohol and prohibited drugs, graduating from cannabis through to methamphetamine products and heroin. The methamphetamine and heroin drugs were usually smoked, the prisoner is not an intravenous user of those drugs.17 In November 2003 he committed some offences of dishonesty for which in June 2004 he was variously fined. In July 2004 he was charged with another offence of dishonesty for which he was granted a six months term of imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but the bond granted in that matter was revoked and he was sentenced to six months imprisonment on 30 August 2004. The Probation and Parole Service report suggests that he did not cooperate with the Probation Service. There was an appeal to the District Court and in lieu of the term of imprisonment he was placed on a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of two years commencing on 16 December 2004. Thus the offences with which I am concerned were whilst on that bond.18 Unfortunately however in the meantime he had been charged with what I understand to be two separate charges of breaking, entering and stealing. At the Magistrate’s Court in October 2004 he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment with a six month non parole period. On appeal, heard at the same time as to the other appeal to which I referred, the non parole periods were reduced to four months, however the total sentence of twelve months stood. The twelve month sentence commenced on 30 August 2004, the non parole period thus would have concluded in late December 2004. It is apparent from this that the prisoner was in breach of his parole when he committed these offences, and certainly was subject to conditional liberty. The Parole Board revoked his parole I am informed and that period required to be served of five months and twelve days commenced from 6 June 2005.19 One of the issues in this matter, and there are many issues that arise in the sentencing in this matter, was the issue of the commencement date of any sentences I must impose. I have come to the conclusion that the commencement date should be the date the prisoner came into custody in relation to these matters, notwithstanding the fact that the prisoner has been required in the meantime to serve the balance of the earlier granted parole. The learned Crown Prosecutor who provided helpful submissions in relation to a number of matters submitted to this Court that the approach the Court should take would be one of commencing any sentences after the period of time required for the prisoner to serve the balance of his parole. I have formed the view that that is not the appropriate way to approach this matter.20 The Crown took me to one authority on this issue, as I understood the Crown’s submissions, and that was the decision of R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. I have noted what their Honours have said in that judgment in relation to an appeal against the inadequacy of sentence of one of my brother judges. However the criticism of the matter at first instance by the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the effective sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge amounted to “no sentence at all”. That is not the case here. The circumstances here having regard to the sentences I propose to impose are somewhat different.21 I have had to undertake some research of my own without the assistance of counsel and there are competing authorities in relation to this issue of the extent to which when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment, the period of time in custody since arrest taken up by serving the balance of parole may be relevant. Of course the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole is a relevant aggravating factor and has been in sentencing for many years. It is a specific aggravating factor to be taken into account under s 21A (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the appropriate case and I feel this is clearly the appropriate case. However there is authority for the proposition that where it is taken into account as an aggravating circumstance it is still appropriate for the Court to backdate the sentence to be imposed, taking into account the time spent in custody after the commission of the offence so that the offender is not effectively penalised twice for the breach of parole. This is a matter that was the subject of discussion with the learned Crown and counsel for the accused and that discussion no doubt has been recorded.22 There is, in my research, several authorities that deal with this issue, particularly the decision of Kaiva (Fatu) NSWCCA 9 November 1998, applied in the decision of David Webb NSWCCA 9 November 1998. Of course the decision has been considered in other judgments, most recently the decision of Callaghan [2006] NSWCCA 58. The reality is, for the reasons that were identified in the discussion with counsel, to impose any sentences accumulative upon the balance of parole would amount to some extent some double dipping and I believe in this matter it is appropriate therefore to backdate the sentences to the time the accused came into custody.23 With regard to the other subjective circumstances of the prisoner apart from his criminal history, I note the prisoner is a person who has some identification with the aboriginal community, having a Fijian mother and an Aboriginal father. He grew up in the Redfern area and then at the age of about ten or twelve as I understand it, certainly in his early teens at the latest, he moved to the Eastlakes Mascot area. His father died when he was seven years of age and the history that he has given to the psychologist suggests a family history of some substance abuse. He has had recent tragedy with his sister’s husband dying at the age of thirty from chronic ill health. As I have earlier indicated when he was approximately thirteen years of age his friend tragically died after being very badly burnt. It would appear on the evidence available to me that his friend was admitted to hospital and lingered for some months. This had a significant affect upon him in a range of ways, although I note in his history that he struggled on at school until year ten, notwithstanding some cognitive disabilities to which I will refer in a moment and of course abuse of alcohol and prohibited drugs.24 He gave evidence before me that he had been a smoker of methamphetamines and heroin and had been using those drugs for some weeks before the commission of the offences and I have already outlined the circumstances that he described on the night of the offence. Since being in custody he has had some contact with his family. He sought on his own initiative to make contact with the aboriginal alcohol and drug counsellor in custody but for various reasons not of his making he has not been able to undertake any counselling.25 I was, in the context of his intellectual capacity, very impressed with the evidence of the prisoner and the prisoner himself. He said certain things to me that showed to me, at least now, some insight into the matters that have caused him to offend in the past. He is anxious to undertake some form of rehabilitation programme. He is anxious to undertake some education programmes and training programmes yet is handicapped by not only intellectual limitations but also a sad history of never having had any employment or training in his life. He has had outpatient treatment at Langton Clinic, being on the buprenorphine programme and has been on methadone. I was impressed to understand that since coming into custody he stopped using methadone, as I understood his evidence, or has certainly decreased his use of methadone seven months ago and he states that he has not been using drugs whilst in custody. A brief check of his custodial record reveals in terms of matters relating to his conduct whilst in custody that since June 2005 there is one minor matter involving some dispute of a physical type, presumably with another inmate, but no references to any positive urine analysis to prohibited drugs.26 The prisoner was, as I indicated, very anxious to consider a rehabilitation programme and there is evidence before me that Benelong’s Haven at Kempsey, a rehabilitation programme specifically designed to treat people from the prisoner’s community, was willing to take the prisoner. The programme at Benelong’s Haven is one of twelve months and in fact the acceptance of the prisoner at Benelong’s Haven was the foundation stone for the submissions put very skilfully on behalf of the prisoner particularly addressing the issue of whether I should grant the prisoner a remand under s 11 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do not need to dwell upon that matter, it was the subject of some discussion but I did not feel this was a matter that was suited to a remand. It seemed to me that this Court would be no better informed after a remand for the appropriate disposal of the matter and even if the prisoner successfully completed the Benelong’s Haven programme, it seemed to this Court that it would inevitably require the prisoner to be committed back into custody for some period of time, which in my view would be more cruel than the approach that I have taken.27 This aspect of the matter has been discussed in several judgments, most notably in the judgment of Howie J in Palu v R and for the reasons identified by his Honour it is a rare circumstance where a remand will be granted pursuant to s 11. This case was not such a case. However I have taken into account as relevant in sentencing the prisoner, the prisoner’s interest in a rehabilitation programme and his acceptance by Benelong’s Haven and I trust the parole authorities will give him that opportunity in due course.28 If I could turn to the myriad of matters that arise of principle very quickly, other than the ones that I have already discussed that need to be taken into account in sentencing this prisoner. In no particular order of importance I firstly deal with the issue of the relevance of the penalties imposed upon the other offenders. I am limited in my knowledge of the circumstances of those matters for the reasons I have outlined. However it is quite clear on the facts of these matters that those younger persons were clearly the ringleaders of these offences. They took by far the leading role and it was just the misfortune of the prisoner to be in their company that he got dragged into the commission of these offences.29 The first offence in time the prisoner was a principal in the second degree on the Crown’s own account and concession. Clearly no issue of strict parity arises. The co-offenders were dealt with in a Children’s Court jurisdiction where there is a philosophy of sentencing considerably different than that in this Court for obvious reasons. Also there were jurisdictional limits upon what the Court could impose by way of custodial penalties if the Court saw fit. Also this prisoner was on parole which I assume the other offenders were not, in fact I am happy to assume for the purposes of this exercise that they had no prior offences.30 However it is well known to the courts of course that, within reason, mere youth is not a matter that prevents offenders behaving in a criminal way and in a deliberately criminal fashion, and this is the case in this matter. In sentencing this prisoner of course it is critical to my approach to the matter to understand the limited role of the prisoner and the leading role of the others. In the limited time available to me since this matter came before me I have considered a number of authorities dealing with the issue of parity of sentencing where co-offenders are dealt with in other jurisdictions with limited sentencing jurisdiction compared to this Court or alternatively offences are dealt with in this Court where they may have been dealt with in courts of limited jurisdiction. One such case is the case of Doan. I have been drawn to a decision of English by the parties, that is an unreported decision of June 2000. It is clear to my mind when one analyses it that whilst no issue of strict parity arises, the penalties imposed on the co-offenders, particularly the penalty imposed on Mr Carr, is not entirely irrelevant to the sentencing proceedings, particularly where it can be fairly said that this offender had a lesser role than that offender and I have approached the matter on that basis, slightly constraining the approach that otherwise would apply if this matter did not arise for consideration. Particularly in Doan I note the approval of the approach in R v Kappa (1993) 69 ACR 64, discussed at para 43 in the decision of Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317. 31 In relation to the robbery matter the decision of R v Henry and ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 is to be considered. Although this is an offence of robbery in company, there are a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal saying that the guideline for armed robbery has relevance to sentencing offenders charged with robbery type offences, particularly carrying the same maximum penalty such as robbery in company. In this matter of course so far as the robbery is concerned, whilst the prisoner is legally culpable for the offence of robbery in company, he is culpable as a principal in the second degree. The guideline judgment is concerned with the activities of a person acting as a principal in the first degree one might have thought, having regard to the criteria that are identified in the guideline by the Chief Justice. The judgment of Henry is referred to by the Crown. I bear in mind of course that guideline judgments are precisely that, guides to enable the sentencing discretion of judges in courts such as this to be structured, but they do not have the power of binding precedants and of course every case must be determined on its facts.32 As was approved by Wood CJ at CL in Henry, from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Engert, it is erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences flowed from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. Every case requires the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the individual case and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise. The learned Chief Justice in the very first guideline of Jurisic adopted with some qualification with approval the observations of Mahoney ACJ in Lattouf about the need for individualised approach to sentencing to ensure that justice was done in the individual case.33 But in considering an appropriate penalty for this I have taken into account that guideline judgment. I have noted s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I have identified the most significant aggravating factor that arises pursuant to subs 2, that is that the offender was subject to parole and also subject a bond to be of good behaviour.34 With regard to relevant mitigating factors arising under subs 3 the prisoner has shown remorse for the offence. I can not say that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation, nor can I say that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend however he has better prospects if he is given the opportunity to undertake appropriate rehabilitation programmes and has an extended period of parole supervision.35 In my view thus there are special circumstances, other than the special circumstance that arises from the partial accumulation of the respective sentences. Obviously in accordance with Pearce v The Queen I am required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then turn to the issue of accumulation or concurrency. I accept the submission of the Crown in light of the circumstances of this matter that there should be some partial accumulation of one sentence upon another, although the two offences are very closely related. I should also, of course, in sentencing the prisoner have regard to the totality of any sentences I would impose by that accumulation.36 With regard to the Probation and Parole Service report it confirms the prisoner’s remorse for his involvement in this offence. There seemed to me in his evidence and in the account he has given to Dr Lennings and to the Probation and Parole Service a considerable degree of melancholy for the prisoner in finding himself in the current situation by reason of what could be called an unfortunate coalescence of circumstances not of his making as the facts reveal.37 In determining there are special circumstances I note the failures of supervision and parole in the past. The record of lack of cooperation is clearly noted in that report but on the other hand the report acknowledges the history of drug abuse and dependence which would affect his conduct. The Probation and Parole Officer says that: 
     
      
       “whilst the prisoner has failed to respond favourably to opportunities offered to him in the past or to adequately address his serious addictive behaviour, long term residential rehabilitation requires close consideration. However success in overcoming his addiction relies heavily on his willingness to seriously confront his substance abuse. He is suitable for medium to high level of intervention by the Service and a case plan would need to be formulated to include strategies to address his needs particularly in relation to alcohol and drug use and his poor employment history.” 
      
    38 The Probation and Parole Service report clearly confirms the need for an extended period of parole supervision, not only to assist the prisoner in the wider community in a range of ways, but to assist him to adjust to community living because it is a sad fact that the prisoner is greatly institutionalised to this point of time.39 In assessing this matter and determining both the appropriate penalties and the structure of the penalties, I have had very close regard to Dr Lennings’ report. I do not propose to go through it in detail however what is significant in that report apart from the history the prisoner has given not only of his drug usage but of his psychological state is the fact that Dr Lennings with appropriate testing has determined that the prisoner: 40 falls into the border line mentally retarded range for ability, and is no better than the bottom five per cent of the population. He says:  
     
      
      ""he is quite clearly a person of very low cognitive function whose coping skills are compromised as a result”. 
      
    41 In the context of his history of drug usage this is a significant matter. This is not a case that raises directly what has been discussed in decision such as Engert to which I made earlier reference ((1985) 84 ACR, 67 and 71) and in Henry where Wood CJ discussed the relevance of mental abnormality to issues such as personal and general deterrence and other judgments along those lines such as Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 and Wright v R (1997) 93ACR at 48. On the other hand in my view the intellectual disability of the prisoner is very significant in this matter insofar as it reflects upon the circumstances of his life up until the present time and the need for him to receive professional assistance.42 The conclusion of Dr Lennings is that given his dysfunctional childhood, his low cognitive function and of course his drug and alcohol problems and his reaction to the trauma of the death of his close friend, the prisoner’s criminal offending is largely a product of his poor coping and his substance abuse. He has few social supports and very few life skills and without the opportunity of gaining life skills he will continue to offend and thus his prognosis for the future is accordingly bleak. Association with delinquent peers is a significant matter and that is made clear in this case. He recommends a rehabilitation programme involving a residential component, a programme which is “culturally appropriate” would be the best programme for him. Alternatively the Bridge programme run by the Salvation Army.43 Having regard to Dr Lennings’ views on the matter, an experienced and respected psychologist, I am of the view that in recommending that the prisoner be placed in residential care that should be a matter left to decision by the Probation and Parole Service, or the Parole Board, at the appropriate time.44 With regard to the issue of special circumstances that arise in this matter and warrant the exercise of the discretion available under s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to adjust the non parole period, as I have said there is partial accumulation of sentences which is a relevant matter to the exercise of that discretion and the other features of the matter to which I have referred.45 I have had regard of course to all the submissions put by the Crown and for the accused and I thank the Crown very much for the detailed written submissions. The various matters identified by the Crown have been properly taken into account. There should be some element of personal and general deterrence in this matter, that is why I am fixing terms of imprisonment, but the terms of imprisonment in this matter, notwithstanding the serious allegations bought against the accused, must to some extent be mitigated or ameliorated by reason of firstly, and most importantly, the particular role of the prisoner and the way in which he was drawn into the offence and, secondly, the unfortunate background of the prisoner which has led him to the circumstances in which he finds himself.46 Finally in this regard by reference to the history of substance abuse, I note what is said about drug addiction and its relevance to sentencing to armed robbery offences in the decision of R v Henry, particularly by Wood CJ at CL, at para 2 73. Clearly in this matter it is relevant to the issue of the impulsivity of the offence. This is not a matter where it could be said of the prisoner’s involvement at least that there was any planning on his part. It also is relevant to the state of mind of the prisoner and particularly the capacity of the prisoner to exercise judgment, such as judgment to withdraw from the scheme devised by his co-accused. 47 Of course his history of drug dependence is relevant to his prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation as discussed by Dr Lennings. The prisoner is not at the crossroads but I bear in mind in relation to the matter that the prisoner to some extent may be viewed as a person, given his cultural and other history, as coming to drug addiction not clearly as a matter of direct personal choice but as a result of coalition of circumstances beyond his control. In this regard, particularly given his aboriginality, I note in the decision of Henry the observations of Simpson J at pp 411 to 412 which in my view have salience in this particular matter.48 Thus having regard to the various issues that I have identified I make the following orders.49 Firstly in relation to the offence of robbery in company committed on 6 June 2005 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of twelve months to date from 6 June 2005 and to expire on 5 June 2006 and the balance of the sentence is one year and four months. The starting point for that sentence I calculate to be three years but I have given you a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas in accordance with the guideline judgment in Thomson and Houlton as I have for the other matter. The balance of sentence in that matter will expire on 5 October 2007.50 In relation to the breaking entering and stealing in circumstances of aggravation committed on 6 June 2005, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of six months to date from 6 June 2006 and to expire on 5 December 2006. In relation to that matter I fix a balance of sentence of two years and six months to date from 6 December 2006 and to expire on 6 June 2009. That will mean if you are released on parole you will be subject to parole supervision for two and a half years.51 I recommend that on your release to parole that you be admitted to a suitable residential rehabilitation programme. In fixing that non parole period I have taken into account the special circumstances I have identified as warranting the significant adjustment of the otherwise appropriate non parole period.52 Now, madam Crown are there any technical matters from you?53 CHAPPEL: No your Honour.54 HIS HONOUR: Any particular matters from you sir?55 EVENDEN: I’ll just raise this your Honour. Could I just clarify the sentences. I think your Honour said in relation to the robbery in company matter that there’d be a six month non parole period from--56 HIS HONOUR: No I didn’t, no I said there’ll be a twelve month non parole period from 6 June 2005 expiring on 5 June 2006 and a six month non parole for the break and enter in circumstances of aggravation dating from 6 June 2006 and expiring on 5 December 2006. That’s what I thought I’ve said. I’ve read from my notes, if there has been any slip of the tongue. In my view the second offence is more serious for the reason that it involved the taking of Mr Sultan against his will, even though there was the same maximum penalty and it was an offence committed after the first offence. So that to my mind in the context of the criminality is a relevant, if I can use the word rather unwisely “aggravation”.57 EVENDEN: And just to clarify your Honour, so there was a six month non parole period for robbery in company?58 HIS HONOUR: No.59 EVENDEN: Sorry, a twelve month.60 HIS HONOUR: There’s a twelve month non parole period from 6 June 2005 expiring on 5 June 2006. Cumulative upon that is a six month non parole period for the break and enter and stealing in circumstances of aggravation dating from 6 June 2006 and expiring on 5 December 2006 and a balance of sentence of two and a half years. That makes a total sentence for that offence of three years, recognising a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. That is what I have thought I have said and if I did not say that that is what I intended to say.61 EVENDEN: And the balance of sentence in relation to the first matter?62 HIS HONOUR: One year and four months. That makes for that matter a total sentence of two years and four months, which I calculate to be three-quarters of three years, recognising a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.63 EVENDEN: And your Honour recommended that the Parole Service considers a residential programme?64 HIS HONOUR: Exactly, that is exactly what I said.65 EVENDEN: I understand. Your Honour there’s one matter that I would seek to raise and that is that property was seized from Mr Lovoni at the time of his arrest that included some shoes which he is anxious to get back. I have spoken to the officer in charge about that and he has asked that your Honour make an order that the exhibits be returned.66 HIS HONOUR: I direct that all exhibits be returned, including the property of the prisoner to the prisoner. Now Mr Lovoni you understand the sentences I have imposed.67 OFFENDER: Yes.68 HIS HONOUR: What do you understand the sentences to be in total?69 OFFENDER: If I don’t get parole, I’ll probably get out ‘09.70 HIS HONOUR: Say that again, I’m sorry?71 OFFENDER: If I don’t get parole, I’ll probably get out ’09.72 HIS HONOUR: No no that is not what happens. No, your parole period expires in December 2006. That is December this year. If you are given parole you get out then. But you are on parole until early or mid 2009. Do you understand that. That is two and a half years after December.73 OFFENDER: Yes.74 HIS HONOUR: So the total sentence is four years dating from 6 June 2005, that is last year, with a non parole period of eighteen months. Do you understand that?75 OFFENDER: Yes. A non parole period eighteen months.76 HIS HONOUR: Dating from last year. Do you understand that?77 OFFENDER: Yes.78 HIS HONOUR: Thank you.79 ADJOURNED

     Judgment 
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Hoeben J.2 JAMES J: I agree with Hoeben J.3 HOEBEN J:Offences and sentence: On 19 April 2005 the applicant was sentenced by Coolahan DCJ in respect of the following offences:Count 1:Armed robbery with an offensive weapon causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years).Included on a Form 1 were two offences of aggravated robbery contrary to s95 of the Crimes Act.Count 2:Armed robbery with an offensive weapon, contrary to s97 of the Crimes Act (maximum penalty imprisonment for 20 years).Included on a Form 1 was an offence of robbery with an offensive weapon contrary to s97 of the Crimes Act.4 His Honour imposed the following sentences:Count 1:Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 years to commence 16 March 2004 and to expire 15 March 2010 with a balance of sentence of 3 years to expire 15 March 2013.Count 2:Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years to commence 16 September 2008 and to expire 15 September 2011 with a balance of sentence of 3.5 years to expire on 15 March 2015.5 The effect of his Honour’s sentences was a non-parole period of 7 ½ years with a balance of term of 3½ years. The applicant was arrested on 16 March 2004 and has been in custody since that date.Background to offences:Count 16 In relation to count 1, on 26 June 2003 the victim, a young woman, was working alone at Theo’s Liquor Store at Boolaroo. About midday the applicant entered the store and purchased a beer. He left the store, returned a short time later and asked the victim for a full carton of beer. The victim was followed into the cool room by the applicant. The applicant pushed her and produced a knife. He tied the victim up with her hands behind her back. The applicant left the cool room but returned a short time later demanding access to the cash register and subsequently to a safe. The applicant took the victim’s car keys.7 The victim escaped and made her way towards the counter. The applicant returned and again tied the victim’s hands and made her get onto the ground. A short time later the victim got to her feet and the applicant struck her on the back of the head. The applicant then punched the victim on the right side of her face. The victim fell and was punched again by the applicant as she hit the floor. As a result the victim suffered three fractures to her facial bones and later required surgery to insert surgical plates. The applicant re-tied the victim’s hands, tied her feet and threatened to stab her with the knife.8 The applicant left the store, stealing business takings of $290, the store security video cassette recorder and the victim’s handbag, including its contents. The victim managed to release herself and run from the store and raise the alarm. The applicant was identified by DNA evidence, that was located on items left at the scene.9 In relation to the first matter on the Form 1 relating to Count 1, on 5 June 2003 at approximately 11.40am the victim in that matter, again a young woman, was cleaning shelves at the Civic Video Store at Adamstown. While doing so she saw the applicant enter and go to the rear of the store. The applicant requested a certain video. As the victim turned towards the applicant, she saw him holding what she described as a double barrel shotgun in his right hand. 10 The applicant stated that he was not going to hurt her but demanded to know where the safe was. The victim was told to lie on the floor and the applicant tied her hands behind her back and tied her ankles together with two pieces of cloth. The applicant went to the counter and took the contents of the cash tin. The applicant then left the scene. The victim untied her hands and feet and pressed the panic alarm in the store. The proceeds of the robbery were $442. The applicant was identified by DNA evidence left at the scene.11 As to the second matter on the Form 1 relating to count 1, on 21 June 2003 at about 11.50am the applicant entered a shop known as Pine Cottage in the Kotara Shopping Centre. The victim in that matter, a young woman, was working alone and there were no other customers inside the shop. The victim spoke to the applicant and then entered the rear area of the shop. A short time later, the applicant approached the victim and after displaying a knife, ordered her to lie face down on the floor. The applicant used a length of electrical wire to restrain the victim’s ankles and wrists in a hog-tie manner. The victim was able to free one hand and the applicant retied the restraint.12 The applicant used a piece of cloth located in the shop as a gag on the victim and threw a transparent raincoat over her head. The applicant demanded money and opened the safe using a key which the victim located for him. The applicant took an amount of $200 from the safe and a further $20 in change from the victim’s handbag. He also stole her purse containing two credit cards and other personal items.13 The applicant demanded the victim’s PIN number for her Westpac keycard. The victim supplied a number, which was slightly different from the true PIN number. The applicant told the victim that if the PIN number were correct he would call police and assist in her release but if it were incorrect, he would return and obtain the correct one. The applicant left the shop and the victim was able to untie herself. She went to a nearby shop where she reported the robbery. A total of $1,160 was stolen from the victim’s account through the use of her ATM card.Count 214 In relation to count 2 the victim, a young woman, was working alone at the Video-Ezy store in Cardiff on 9 July 2003. At about 11.40am the applicant approached the counter and demanded money. The victim refused. The applicant then said “I’m not joking give me all the money. I will kill you if you don’t.” The applicant raised his hand from behind the counter and produced a black coloured handgun. 15 At this point a female customer, and her seven year old son, entered the store. The victim attempted to warn them, however, the applicant approached the woman and her son and ordered them to lie on the floor. Both complied while the applicant stood over them. He then stole the customer’s handbag and its contents. The applicant took money from the cash register and ran from the store. The total amount of money stolen from the video store was $290. The total of the property belonging to the customer was $80 in cash and some personal papers. The applicant was identified by DNA evidence located at the scene of the crime. It was the robbery of the customer in the Video-Ezy store which comprised the Form 1 matter in respect of count 2.16 As indicated, the injuries suffered by the victim in count 1 were considerable. She was hospitalised and required an operation to repair the damage to her face. She was left with some neurological difficulties in her face and problems with concentration and short-term memory. She also developed depression and a form of anxiety. As of the date of sentence, the victim was still suffering significant physical and mental sequelae as a result of the applicant’s conduct.Remarks on sentence17 The applicant was born on 27 August 1967 and was 37 at the time of sentence. His criminal record included a number of drink, drive and drug matters in the 1990’s. In 2000 he received varying sentences not involving fulltime custody for break, enter and steal, fraud, larceny and making a false instrument with intent. His Honour noted that there was nothing in the applicant’s history as serious as these offences and nothing which involved violence.18 His Honour had regard to a report from Peter Ashcar, a psychologist who saw the applicant at the Parklea Correctional Centre on 12 January 2005. In relation to the applicant’s background, Mr Ashcar recorded that although the applicant had commenced using cannabis at age 15, he had completed a four year apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker and worked for 10 years with the same company in that industry until it closed down. At the time of the offences, however, the applicant was not working.19 The psychologist noted that the applicant had an extensive history of substance abuse involving alcohol, amphetamines and most recently, crystal methamphetamine. Although the applicant had sought counselling in the past for his drug problems, this had not been successful.20 According to the psychologist, the applicant’s use of crystal methamphetamine commenced when he was 35 years of age. The applicant described its effect as giving him a sense of euphoria and omnipotence. The applicant told Mr Ashcar that it also caused him to become obsessed with whatever it was that was on his mind at the time. The applicant was aware that it caused him to become agitated and aggressive, particularly when withdrawing from the substance.21 The applicant told Mr Ashcar that he was using crystal methamphetamine in the days prior to the commission of these offences. He was “off his head” and “coming down” from the effects of the substance at the time of the offences. He said that he committed the offences to obtain money to purchase further crystal methamphetamine.22 It was Mr Ashcar’s opinion that the applicant’s criminal behaviour relating to these offences was a direct result of a substance dependence disorder. Because of the applicant’s lack of violent criminal history, his behaviour in relation to these offences was directly attributable to his use of the drug crystal methamphetamine. If the applicant could abstain from using that drug Mr Ashcar thought that the risk of him engaging in such violent offending behaviour in the future would be significantly reduced.23 The applicant gave evidence before his Honour. He confirmed most of which was contained in the psychologist’s report. He expressed remorse for what had happened to the victim in count 1 and said he was horrified to find that he was capable of doing such things. He attributed his behaviour to the effects of the use of crystal methamphetamine. His Honour concluded that the applicant was genuine in his remorse and his Honour was prepared to accept that the applicant’s violent behaviour was due to his addiction to that drug. While this explained to some extent the applicant’s behaviour, his Honour noted that the applicant on his own admission knew that the use of the drug rendered him prone to violence.24 Having noted the competing submissions of the Crown and counsel for the applicant, his Honour set out his conclusions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In dealing with the offender I have taken into account those matters required to be considered under s21A of the Act. Aggravating factors not contemplated by the offences themselves are difficult to identify. However of course, the offences themselves are extremely serious and are to be so regarded because of the maximum penalties provided for them, along with decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal over the years including of course the guideline decision in  
        Henry 
        . 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mitigating factors are few. I cannot say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. But I think that I should accept, on balance, that he currently has a resolve to deal with his drug addiction. Anecdotally, he is also of an age when people, with long standing drug addictions, tend to make efforts to rehabilitate.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Of course I take into account the offender’s pleas of guilty, entered as they were at the first available opportunity, and for which I would allow a discount of 25%. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied that there should be findings of special circumstances based on the need for supervised rehabilitation upon release from custody and also because this will be the offender’s first custodial sentence. But I do not think that a significant departure from the normal ratio between non-parole period and parole period is justified. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        So far as count 1 is concerned, there are obvious reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. Firstly there is the offender’s plea of guilty, and secondly there is the finding of special circumstances. As against that, however, the Form 1 matters are to be taken into account. These in themselves are very serious matters so perhaps not objectively falling at the midway point of seriousness. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Nonetheless it is clear that more than lip service must be paid to those offences when dealing with the offender for the account on the indictment. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am of the view that there should be some partial accumulation. The offences were distinct offences. However, in dealing with the offender I have taken into account the principle of totality. On that basis the finding of special circumstances in relation to count 2 will produce a more significant reduction in the non-parole period than for count 1.” 
        
       
      
    25 In relation to the standard non-parole period, his Honour commented on the Crown’s submission that from an objective point of view that offence was at the mid range of seriousness: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would have thought that it was certainly in the mid range, and probably towards the upper end of that range.” 
        
       
      
    Grounds of appealGround 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive26 This was the only ground of appeal relied upon. No complaint was made in relation to the individual sentences imposed by his Honour. The submission was that the overall term was excessive and offended the principle of totality. It was submitted that there should have been greater concurrency between the sentences so as to reduce the overall term.27 In support of that submission, the following propositions were put:(i) The applicant had no record of violence until these five episodes which occurred in June-July 2003.(ii) These episodes of significant criminality were restricted to a period of less than two months and could be accounted for by the applicant’s addiction to crystal methamphetamine.(iii) Between 9 July 2003 and 16 March 2004 when the applicant was apprehended, there had been no repetition of such violent criminality which indicated some measure of rehabilitation.28 The Court was also invited to approach the matter on the basis that if allowance were made for the 25% discount for the pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity, the original head sentence would have been almost fifteen years. This, it was submitted, indicated that the combined effect of the sentences was manifestly excessive.29 I have some difficulty with that last submission. If only one sentence had been passed it could have had more force. In this case, however, two sentences are involved and it is the extent of the accumulation or lack of adequate concurrency which is criticised. In any event the applicant does not dispute undiscounted head sentences of 12 years and 8 years 8 months in respect of counts 1 and 2. In those circumstances it is difficult to see how an undiscounted head sentence of slightly less than 15 years is manifestly excessive.30 Although the period of criminality was brief the offences which occurred during that period were objectively very serious. Not only was the level of violence in count 1 significant going beyond that which was necessary to make out the ingredients of the offence (R v Way (2004) 16 NSWLR 168 at [106-107]) but the Form 1 matters, which were to be taken into account in relation to it, themselves involved serious criminality. This latter consideration required greater weight to be given in relation to the sentence for count 1 to personal deterrence and society’s entitlement to extract retribution for offences for which no specific punishment had been imposed (Attorney-General’s application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [40-42]).31 His Honour was well aware of the link between the applicant’s episodes of violent criminality and his ingestion of crystal methamphetamine. His Honour referred at some length to the opinion of the psychologist, Mr Ashcar. His Honour also had regard to the fact that the applicant was aware that the ingestion of crystal methamphetamine by him brought on violent and aggressive episodes. His Honour did not think that those subjective considerations significantly reduced the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour did not think that the applicant had particularly good prospects of rehabilitation. 32 Against that background with no challenge having been made to the individual sentences, the question for this Court is whether his Honour’s approach to accumulation and concurrency was outside a proper sentencing discretion. As has often been said, this is a Court of error. Unless error can be shown in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion this Court has no power to intervene. The totality of the sentences imposed by his Honour had to properly reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and reflect all of the circumstances, both positive and negative, surrounding those offences. His Honour had regard to those matters. I am not persuaded that in accumulating the sentences as his Honour did, he erred in his exercise of discretion.33 The orders which I propose are: (i) Leave to appeal be granted. (ii) The appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 May, 15 July, and 15 September last year the appellant was before his Honour Magistrate Gordon Lerve upon four charges. I understand he was acquitted of one, as to another I have not been informed of its outcome. He does however appeal against the findings of guilty and conviction recorded in respect of a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol and a further charge of exceeding the speed limit by greater than 45 kilometres per hour.2 These two offences were said to have occurred at the same time on 7 February 2004. The appeal is by way of a re-hearing on the transcript and evidence before his Honour in the court below. On that occasion the appellant did not give evidence. He has been granted leave to adduce his own evidence and evidence from his wife. I gave leave to the Crown to adduce evidence in reply so it could deal with allegations that had not been made in evidence by the appellant that had not been put in the court below. The appellant was unrepresented and appeared in person.3 The prosecution case was that at about 11.35 pm two highway patrol officers were patrolling in the Kellyville area. They saw the appellant turn right into Memorial Avenue from Windsor Road. They followed him. They noticed he was speeding. Memorial Avenue is a short street, little more than half a kilometre. The appellant turned left into Balmoral without using indicators. He increased speed. Their radar equipment locked onto the vehicle doing 119 kilometres per hour. The patrol officers pursued the vehicle. At least one of them knew who the driver was and where he lived. They were anxious to reach him before he reached home. They activated their blue strobe lamps and flashed the high beams.4 The appellant reached his home which was several hundred meters south of Old Windsor Road. The appellant indicated and turned left into the drive of 494 Old Windsor Road when he alighted from the motor vehicle. It would appear he had driven something in the order of two kilometres or so from the time he was locked in at 119 kilometres per hour. Time-wise that appear to be about a minute or so of driving between the vehicle’s speed being measured and the appellant pulling up at his back door.5 When he arrived at 494 Old Windsor Road the appellant alighted from his motor vehicle. Each patrol officer independently formed the view he was under the influence of alcohol. In the light of that uncontested evidence it is not surprising the learned Magistrate convicted the appellant of these two offences.6 The appellant’s evidence is he neither sped nor had drunk more than 700 mils of Crown lager since 8 pm that evening. In the light of his denials a more careful scrutiny of the Crown evidence is required.7 Any examination of the appellant’s evidence suggests that he is intelligent, and that has a real hesitancy in his speech patterns. He is cautious, rephrases and allows himself time to think by frequent use of the speech filler “um”. That is not to say he does not express himself with precision. He does, his evidence occupied all of four hours and possibly more.8 His wife gave evidence first. It is fair to say her evidence contributed nothing to the resolution of this case. She was in China on 7 February 2004 and did not return until a month later. He had talked to her between 8 and 8.30 pm on 7 February and so far as she could tell, he was sober during that telephone conversation.9 The appellant’s account was that he had been working all day Saturday 7th. It was a hot day. He was physically tired when he returned home at about 8 pm. His wife reminded him of the 700 mil bottle of Crown lager. He consumed some, or all of the beer, whether warm or cold is unclear on the evidence, watched a movie and dozed in front of the TV. He awoke invigorated, decided he would go for a drive, made his way to Vineyard, refuelled in the dark the tractor he was using the following day, and returned home. He stopped to shop at a local BP service station and collected four bags of groceries.10 On the return journey he noticed the highway patrol vehicle at Memorial Avenue travelling in the opposite direction to him. He followed other cars into Memorial and Balmoral, he maintained the speed limit, he turned into Old Windsor Road and then into his premises. He had to stop to open the driveway gate. He drove down what he said was 120 meter driveway, had delivered two loads of groceries in bags to the back steps and was in the process of delivering a third when the police vehicle arrived in his driveway with lights flashing.11 He recognised Senior Constable Crompton, the patrol officer driving the highway patrol vehicle who, by this time had left the police vehicle and was making his way on foot towards the appellant. The appellant lifted the two groceries bags holding them in front of him, shaking them slightly to indicate that he was taking them from the car towards the house as the case may be.12 Senior Constable Crompton was holding a handheld tape recorder and informed the offender he was taping the conversations. I will return to this aspect of the case shortly.13 There were conversations between them. On the appellant’s account Senior Constable Crompton approached quickly, grabbed him and said “You were going to decamp.” The appellant was handcuffed. A VB bottle lid was picked up from the ground and Senior Constable Crompton said “Is this a souvenir from the night?” The appellant refused to engage in any conversation other than on two occasions because he recognised he was being framed. 14 A caged truck was called. He was taken to the police station. Two charges were ultimately preferred, neither said the appellant had any merit.15 There is no doubt Senior Constable Crompton taped with a handheld tape recorder all conversation between him and the appellant, and other conversation in which he does not appear to have played a role, although the appellant does. That conversation occurs later, apparently at the police station.16 The now Senior Sergeant Crompton said something in evidence before me which leads me to believe that it is his practice to use the tape recorder to “protect himself.” The evidence was not objected to in the Local Court. The appellant was unrepresented in this court. The evidence coming from the tape conversations as matters turned out favoured both sides.17 While I have not heard submissions nor researched other than to note the provisions of s 5 of the Listening Devices Act, my preliminary view is both the taping of conversations and the publication of the contents of the tape amount to criminal offences that carry a maximum penalty of two years. I make available to the parties s 5 and s 11 of the Listening Devices Act hopefully for the edification of both sides. It may well be that there is some exception to the police although I doubt it, because I note that there is a provision in the Listening Devices Act allowing police to tape a refusal of somebody to engage in an ERISP. Put another way, the evidence tendered from the tape conversation may well have been illegally or unlawfully obtained.18 The cross-examination of Senior Sergeant Crompton discloses a “history” with the appellant. In 1997 the appellant complained to the Ombudsman and/or some other authority about a specific incident involving then Senior Constable Crompton. Senior Constable Crompton, in his evidence before the Local court, was of the view that not only had the appellant complained about him but every other officer at the Castle Hill Police station (see tape). Senior Constable Crompton told his Honour in evidence that police had frequently been called to the appellant’s premises and that he was a high risk offender. Senior Constable Crompton also agreed in the Local court he had breathalysed the appellant two nights earlier and had stopped him for that purpose because he was a high risk offender, there being as I understand it, no other probably cause to use an American phrase.19 It is not difficult to discern from the cross-examination of Senior Constable Crompton he has a very fixed antipathetic attitude towards the appellant. Indeed his willingness, gratuitously to reveal this antipathetic attitude to the appellant through cross-examination raises the question of whether this officer of twenty-one years has maintained his professionalism in this case.20 The unlawful use of the tape recorder also raises the same issue of one of professionalism. His statement makes reference to the appellant’s “rolling his body out of the car seat”, “slowly, clumsily movements wiping his face with his right hand”, “bloodshot eyes, glazed in appearance with enlarged pupils” (observed from 5 meters on a dark night), I interpolate in darkness pupils would become enlarged in any event.21 The patrol officer’s observations continued “his movements were sluggish and he continued to stumble and trip over himself as he walked”, “he lurched to the left falling against a metal frame near the wall of the house.” There were occasions when the appellant looked “blankly” at Senior Constable Crompton. Senior Constable Crompton’s evidence was the appellant was at the high end of moderately affected by alcohol.22 Senior Constable Jurd, the other highway patrol officer, while he comes to a view the appellant was “well affected by alcohol”, makes an assessment that does not appear to be based upon the same assessment of events as Senior Constable Crompton. For example he has the offender “immediately getting out of the driver’s side seat”, “stumbling about and stumbling on the spot”, “unsteady on his feet”, “slumped over when he was standing”, “unable to walk a straight line”, “tripped over his own feet.” “So he tripped over his own feet a number of times”, “making a dash for the back door of his residence”, “sweating profusely”, “bloodshot eyes (as does Senior Constable Crompton)” and “clothes, disorganised.”23 Senior Constable Jerd has I think seven years experience. I do not regard Senior Constable Jerd’s assessment as supporting Senior Constable Crompton’s. The details do not match. Both, it is true, reach a view the appellant is well affected but they could have been assessing two different persons.24 Nor was I impressed with the corruption of the use of the tape recorder. My understanding of its purpose was to record conversations between the appellant and Senior Constable Crompton. He, Senior Constable Crompton, told the transporting officers they were not to speak to the appellant unless the tape recorder was activated. Yet conversations containing opinion evidence and self serving statements were recorded at the scene. See for example Senior Constable Jerd, “You look like you had a bit to drink”; see also paragraph 22 (of Senior Constable Crompton’s statement) when Senior Constable Crompton says, “It was obvious to us that you were well and truly exceeding the speed limit.” Conversations at paragraph 25 of arrangements being made between the two police officers; conversations at paragraph 27, “Why did you elbow me, now you’ve got an assault police on your hands”; paragraph 28, “he just took exception to me and smacked me in the chest”; comment from Jerd, “the smell of alcohol is strong”; reply from Senior Constable Crompton, “Yeah, he’s rotten, there’s no doubt about that”; Senior Constable Jerd, “That would explain why he didn’t stop until he got into his premises”; Senior Constable Crompton, “That’s right and try to walk away from me and go into his house for his licence and he’s got his wallet in his pocket”; paragraph 30, “I said, “He’s already had a shot at me, put his elbow into my chest...so.”25 Each of those items of conversations I have referred to was never admissible as evidence in a trial on the issues before me. The fact that it is contemporary comment does not make it admissible, but does make it dangerous. Its appearance on the tape again brings into question the professionalism of the officers involved.26 The two transport officers would appear to have been told the basis of the appellant’s arrest and the likely charges. Neither transport officer had the quality of contact with the appellant that Senior Constable Crompton and Senior Constable Jerd had. However, it is to be remembered Senior Constable Crompton makes the point that from the moment the appellant alighted from the car it “became apparent to me very quickly the appellant was under the influence of alcohol or a drug.”27 From Jerd’s perspective the first thing the appellant did when he alighted from the car was to “step away from his vehicle where he stumbled about... I watched as he continued to stumble on the spot.”28 Detective Senior Constable Crompton said the appellant was “very unsteady on his feet”, “unable to walk in a straight line as I guided him towards the gate.”29 Constable Nasser, one of the officers who transported the appellant to Castle Hill was apparently not gifted with the same obvious observations. His only comment was that when he opened the door of the caged truck he noticed “a strong smell of alcohol coming from the appellant.” At the police station the appellant walked in front of them into the station apparently without any assistance. Constable Nasser made no comment otherwise suggesting the appellant was incapacitated in any way in his walking or otherwise affected by alcohol.30 Constable Voigt was even less helpful to the prosecution case. She made no comment about smelling alcohol or observing any symptom of behaviour that would be consistent with the appellant being under the influence of alcohol.31 I have heard the tape of Senior Constable Crompton and the appellant walking down the driveway to the front gate of the appellant’s premises. There is nothing in the rhythm of the footsteps as I hear the crunch upon the gravel that would persuade me one of the walkers was stumbling, tripping over himself or otherwise having difficulty maintaining a constant gait as he walked with the other.32 Sergeant Vince Fusca was a shift supervisor/custody manager at Castle Hill station in the early morning of 8 September 2004. He made a visual assessment of the appellant. He had of course been told by Senior Constable Crompton that the appellant was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor. That conversation between those two officers occurred at 00.35 am. One minute later, at 00.36 am Sergeant Fusca's visual assessment based upon an unsteady on his feet, strong smell of alcohol and a strong thirst of the appellant (amazing that that was noticed within one minute), was, ""I formed the view that the appellant’s behaviour was suggestive of him being under the influence of drugs and alcohol."" I give little weight to that opinion in those circumstances.33 I have heard the tape of the appellant speaking at the police station. There was none of the hesitancy apparent at court. He was articulate, clearly spoken, there were no slurring of words, much of what is said did him no credit in the sense that it was aggressive and on at least one occasion threatening towards Senior Constable Crompton. Be that as it may it did not sound like the voice of a man who was so unsteady on his feet that he was stumbling on the spot or could not walk a straight line.34 Both police observed the appellant’s driving. Each has reported upon the speed at which he was driving. Neither suggests that in any feature of his driving was he lacking in eye, hand coordination or vision or judgment or steering other than the speed at which he was travelling and his failure to indicate a left hand turn at a point in the road where the intersection was of a Y kind and the appellant chose the left hand option and the turn was not anything more than thirty or so degrees.35 In my view there is a reasonable possibility the three descriptions given as to the appellant’s state of sobriety are overstated. I am satisfied there was a smell of alcohol upon his breath. Before the appellant can be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol it is necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of driving. The prosecution in my view has failed to do so.36 On the other hand the evidence of both officers as to the speed of driving and the path of the vehicle was supportive of each other. In my view it is highly unlikely that this evidence is fabricated and that the police would have appeared at the appellant’s premises perhaps a minute or two after he had driven other than because they were satisfied they had him caught, if I can put it that way, for speeding.37 Senior Constable Crompton’s evidence was that the target window of the radar was still flashing 119 when he pointed it out to the appellant. The appellant’s case is that this was not done and that his car was incapable of travelling at such a speed.38 The appellant has not impressed me as a witness of truth. I regard his account of travelling to refuel a tractor, twenty minutes drive away, at night after a hard day’s work as incredible. Given his desire to conserve time, to travel to Vineyard and back was a waste of 40 minutes, precious time, when he would be with the tractor the following morning after a drive he had to make in any event. In those circumstances he would have dedicated only ten minutes to refuelling the tractor rather than the 50 minutes he sought to persuade the court he had used for that purpose.39 Further, it is inexplicable to me why he should take such a large sum of money as he had in his pocket. Ultimately he purchases four bags of groceries on his account, yet among the property seized were several one hundred dollar bills.40 I am satisfied from what I heard on the tape he did have a bottle top in his pocket. I reject his account that it was on the ground. The way in which it was itemised satisfies me it was part of his property. I reject his account that the bottle top was on the ground. What significance that bottle top has in any event is another matter, but his account of it being on the ground adversely affects his believability.41 Nonetheless I still must be satisfied even though I reject his account on the speed that the prosecution has proved its case. I have already indicated I would be so satisfied and I am. Therefore I find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellant’s speed was accurately clocked at 119 kilometres per hour.42 The formal orders I will be making are that the conviction for the drive whilst under the influence of alcohol will be quashed, but the drive speed 119 kilometres per hour or in excess of 45 kilometres of the speed limit will be proved and the conviction will stand.SUBMISSIONS MADE BY PARTIES43 HIS HONOUR: The conviction appeal in respect of the speeding offence is confirmed. The penalty imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. The penalty imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. The period of disqualification imposed by the learned magistrate is likewise confirmed. That period of disqualification will now have expired.44 The conviction in respect of drive under the influence of alcohol is quashed. The period of disqualification and the fine in respect of the drive under the influence of alcohol conviction are likewise quashed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: The appellant, Carmelo Disano, was tried on a charge that on 2 January 2004 at Abbotsford in the State of New South Wales he did murder Antonino Basile, the father of his estranged wife. On 8 December 2004 after a trial which lasted thirteen days, the appellant was convicted of the offence of murder. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years and a balance of term of 5 years. The sentence was to commence on 2 January 2004. 
     
      
    3 The appellant had pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but the Crown did not accept the latter plea in discharge of the indictment. The appellant’s partial defence relied on a number of alternate grounds.  
     
      
       
      (i) Lack of intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm and the availability of an alternative finding of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
       
       
      (ii) The appellant had acted in reasonable self defence after the deceased had been the aggressor in the altercation between them, including punching and kicking by the deceased. 
       
       
      (iii) Provocation by words and conduct of the deceased, both on the occasion of the fatal altercation with the appellant and in meetings which had occurred since the separation of the appellant and his wife. 
       
       
      (iv) The appellant suffered substantial impairment by reason of an abnormality of mind based on an established medical condition, that is the fact of his severe depression and his paranoid personality disorder. 
       
      
    4 The only ground of appeal raised was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1 – The directions given on the issue of provocation were inadequate and erroneous in that the jury were not informed pursuant to s23(3)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 that there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if there was not a reasonable proportion between the act causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act.” 
        
       
       
      Factual Background 
       
      
    5 The appellant married Maria Disano, the daughter of the deceased, in 1978. They had two daughters, Vanessa born in 1981, and Sarah born in 1986. During the course of the marriage the appellant had temper outbursts, would throw goods and damage property. The appellant used to lose his temper very quickly. The marriage started to deteriorate after the birth of Sarah. 
     
      
    6 On 28 July 2002 the appellant lost his temper over Sarah using the bathroom. In the course of that argument he threatened to throw his wife over the balcony of their Concord home. That night Mrs Disano and the daughters left the family home and thereafter resided with her parents, the deceased and his wife Nella. The appellant remained alone in the family home. 
     
      
    7 From that date there was evidence that the appellant had become depressed. The contact between him and his family was very limited. There was, however, contact on a few occasions. 
     
      
    8 One of those occasions was on 18 November 2002 when the appellant attended Sarah’s birthday celebration uninvited. The function occurred at the deceased’s home. Although the appellant behaved appropriately, there was clear tension between him and the deceased and it was obvious that the deceased was unhappy that the appellant had attended. 
     
      
    9 A few weeks before his death, the deceased and his wife had visited the home of Nina and Carmelo Savoca. Nina Savoca was the appellant’s sister. The appellant was there when the deceased and his wife arrived. A verbal altercation occurred between the deceased and the appellant at those premises with the appellant apparently spitting on the deceased and accusing him and his wife of breaking up his marriage. The appellant had called Nella Basile a “bastard”. 
     
      
    10 Another apparent source of discord between the deceased and the appellant was that the appellant believed that the house which the deceased had made available to him and his wife to live in when they were first married, should have been given to his wife in accordance with Sicilian tradition.  
     
      
    11 On the morning of 2 January 2004 the appellant and the deceased were involved in a fight on a path near the Abbotsford Wharf, which resulted in the death of the deceased. The appellant was perhaps bigger in the shoulders than the deceased, but not much taller. There was a considerable age difference in that the appellant was 53, whilst the deceased was 70 years of age. 
     
      
    12 On that morning the appellant was fishing at the wharf when the deceased came up to him and asked to speak to him. They walked off the wharf together to a nearby park. At the trial the appellant did not give evidence. His version of what thereafter occurred is contained in the ERISP, produced as a result of his interview with the police, and in the statement of his brother-in-law, Salvatore Gangi. There was video from a security camera located on the wharf which showed the deceased coming onto the wharf and speaking to the appellant at about 8.13am. It showed the deceased leaving the wharf with the appellant following him. 
     
      
    13 According to what the appellant told the police, after they had left the wharf the deceased said, “You’ve insulted my wife” and punched the appellant in the face. The appellant punched the deceased back and a fight developed. During the fight the appellant claimed that they punched and bit and kicked each other and at various stages of the fight each was on the ground.  
     
      
    14 The appellant had a laceration over his eye requiring sutures and some other minor lacerations and abrasions. The deceased had sustained head injuries, as well as multiple rib fractures. Death was in fact caused by suffocation.  
     
      
    15 After the fight the appellant went to his sister and brother-in-law’s house, Rosa and Salvatore Gangi. According to Mr Gangi’s statement, which was read to the jury, the appellant told him: 
     
      
       
        
        “He (the deceased) started to throw a punch at me. I started to punch as well. We got tangled together and he start to bites me, tried to do everything, he fell down and I kick him a couple of time when he was on the ground.” I said, “You should apologise to me”. When he was on the ground I walk away.” 
        
       
      
    16 Later that day Mr Gangi drove the appellant to the Five Dock Police Station where he was arrested and interviewed. In that interview, while the appellant said that he and the deceased had punched each other many times and kicked each other during the fight, he denied kicking the deceased after he fell to the ground for the last time, saying that when this occurred he went home. In that interview he did admit to having his foot on the deceased’s back at one point in time, but said that following this, the deceased got up and started punching him again. 
     
      
    17 It seems clear that a violent physical confrontation occurred between the deceased and the appellant on 2 January 2004. It should be noted, however, that the evidence that the deceased threw the first punch came solely from the appellant. 
     
      
    18 Evidence was given by Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist. He attributed the deceased’s death to a combination of multiple blunt force injuries and the inhalation of foreign material. The blunt force injuries included twelve fractured ribs, de-gloving facial injuries and an injury to the left ear consistent with being stomped upon or kicked. The remaining injuries were most likely caused by punches. Suffocation causing the deceased’s death occurred as a result of his inhaling leaf litter and bark material found in and partly obstructing his mouth, windpipe and airways.  
     
      
    19 There were two likely explanations for this: - the absence of an effective cough reflex caused by deep unconsciousness or the appellant having placed his foot on the deceased’s back forcing him to inhale the foreign material. The appellant’s footprint in blood on the back of the deceased’s t-shirt suggested the latter. There were imprints of both the appellant’s left and right shoes on the back of the deceased’s t-shirt. The deceased’s body was found with his arms beneath him in a “push-up” position. The presence of this material down the deceased’s throat indicated that he was alive when he fell on the debris and inhaled it. 
     
      
    20 Apart from the appellant, the only eyewitness to what occurred was Jodie Bruce. She had parked her car and was walking down steps leading to the wharf to catch a ferry when she heard a noise. Looking in the direction of the noise, over 30 metres away, she saw a person kicking something. She gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you say the man was kicking could you describe the manner in which he was doing that? 
         
        A. He was forcibly kicking something but it wasn’t in a frenzied way. It was very calculated. It was a very hard kick, so hard it was audible and you could hear that he was exerting some force in the kick and he would rebalance and then kick again. … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How many times is it you see the kicks being placed? 
         
        A. To me it was probably between five and ten times, because – because of the rebalancing and then going into kicks so it wasn’t – it wasn’t ten kicks in a row, it was sort of slow. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the rebalancing, did that appear to happen between each kick or only between some kicks? 
         
        A. No, between each kick.” 
        
       
      
    21 Although it was suggested at trial that the person whom Jodie Bruce saw was the deceased, the deceased’s injuries would indicate otherwise and the jury’s verdict indicates that they rejected that suggestion. 
     
      
    22 Both psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial agreed that the applicant suffered from a depressive illness. In the appellant’s case it was assessed as significant, and on the Crown’s case as a condition which waxed and waned. The only other issue between the psychiatrists was whether the appellant’s condition had substantially impaired his ability to control himself. 
     
      
       
      Appellant’s submissions 
       
      
    23 In order to understand the submission by the appellant, it is necessary to set out s23 of the Crimes Act, 1900. 
     
      
       
        
        “23 Trial for murder—provocation  
        
       
       
        
        (1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where:  
         
         
          
          (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased,  
           
          whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time.  
           
          
         
        (3) For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if:  
         
         
          
          (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission,  
           
          (b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly, or  
           
          (c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation.  
        
       
       
        
        (5) This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder. “ 
        
       
      
    24 It was submitted by the appellant that it was necessary for the trial judge to give a direction in accordance with s23(3)(a), ie that provocation is not negatived if there was a lack of proportionality between the acts causing death and the conduct of the deceased which induced those acts. Such a direction was necessary because of the appellant’s reliance upon self-defence in which proportionality of response is an important factor and because of the way in which the Crown had put the issue of provocation to the jury. It was submitted that the trial judge’s error was in not correcting, for the benefit of the jury, the incorrect submission made by the Crown. Except for that omission, the appellant agreed that the trial judge’s directions were unexceptionable.  
     
      
    25 The first remarks by the Crown which were impugned were: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other aspect of the matter which was mentioned in a similar context as being what the Crown has to satisfy you in the negative is the question of provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        Now where it comes to the question of provocation, again, is a subject which his Honour will direct you on that matter. But I expect his Honour’s directions will contain the question that a person must  
        act 
         in a manner that a reasonable person, or a person with a minimum degree of self control would have  
        done  
        what the accused  
        did 
         if he had lost control of himself.” (T.507/508) 
        
       
      
    26 The appellant submitted that the use of the words underlined would have focused the jury’s attention on the actions of the appellant, not on his intent. The appellant submitted that the partial defence of provocation in New South Wales focuses on intent and not on the actions of the accused, ie that an ordinary person so lost control as to form the necessary intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    27 The other remarks by the Crown which were criticised were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, if a man – let us assume for the purpose of argument that you have insulted his spouse and he then accosted you and said “why did you insult my wife or my husband?”, and accompanied that with a punch –  
        would that warrant the kind of treatment which the deceased received 
        ? Again, it is a matter for you. I do not pause to go into detail on that.” (T.509) 
        
       
      
    28 This, the appellant submitted, fairly and squarely raised the question of proportionality of response in the context of provocation and that this needed to be corrected by the trial judge. 
     
      
    29 In support of the submission, the appellant relied upon R v Szabo [2000] NSWCCA 226 [46-49]: 
     
      
       
        
        “46 The Appellant’s submission was as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “ … His Honour failed to direct the jury that the provocation claimed was not negatived by the fact that the act was not “reasonably proportional to the conduct of the deceased that could induce the acts” causing the death of the deceased. Nor did his Honour direct the jury that the acts of the appellant if done with an intention to kill or an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm did not negative provocation (s23(3)(a)(c)  
          Crimes Act 
          ). These were important directions in this matter particularly having regard to the character of the attack upon the deceased and the nature of the provocation claimed by the appellant. The directions left the issue of “proportionality” unaddressed in circumstances where it clearly would be of concern to a jury. In fact the issue, if anything may have been interpreted by the jury as requiring “proportionality” to be considered in determining whether relevant conduct could induce “an ordinary person” to relevantly lose control.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        47 The directions which the appellant contends should have been given were not requested by his counsel at the trial.  
        
       
       
        
        48 The duty of the trial judge was to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law. Unless the circumstances of the case made it necessary, he had no duty to direct them about what was not the law. The Crown did not suggest, contrary to s23(3)(a), that provocation was negatived by any lack of reasonable proportionality between the accused's conduct and the deceased's conduct. The trial judge repeatedly directed the jury that the s23(2)(b) issue was whether the ordinary person would have lost self-control in the manner described in that paragraph; if so, it would not matter how much greater the accused's reaction might have been compared to that of the ordinary person, and the trial judge did not suggest that it would matter.  
        
       
       
        
        49 The Crown did not make any submission to the contrary of s23(3)(c). Hence the s23(3)(c) direction, to which no oral argument was directed, was not called for. “ (Heydon JA) 
        
       
      
    30 The appellant relied upon that passage as supporting the proposition that his Honour should have given a direction to the jury in accordance with s23(3)(a) because “the circumstances of the case made it necessary”. Those circumstances were that the Crown in this case had suggested contrary to s23(3)(a) that provocation was negatived by lack of reasonable proportionality between the accused’s conduct and the deceased’s conduct and because self-defence, which did raise proportionality of response in a different context, was one of the matters which had been raised in the trial. These, it was submitted, were the very “circumstances” which Heydon JA had in mind in Szabo as would require such a direction to be given. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    31 The issue in this appeal, ie the absence of a direction by the trial judge as to proportionality of response on the issue of provocation, was not raised at trial. Leave is accordingly required before the issue can be raised in this Court (rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules). As Hunt AJA reaffirmed in R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20 the requirements of r4 are not “some mere technicality” to be “simply … brushed aside”. An obligation falls upon defence counsel at trial to assist the trial judge to give appropriate directions to the jury. Only if an identified error in the summing up has caused a miscarriage of justice, in respect of which the onus lies upon the appellant, will leave be granted under rule 4 (see also R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [74] and Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319). 
     
      
    32 As was properly conceded on behalf of the appellant, his Honour’s directions as to provocation were correct and appropriate. The appellant’s complaint is that the “circumstances of the case” required a further direction in terms of s23(3)(a) clarifying the question of reasonable proportionality in the context of the partial defence of provocation. 
     
      
    33 The fact that self-defence and provocation were relied upon by the appellant at trial did not of itself require such a direction. Not only did his Honour provide clear and accurate oral directions in relation to each, he provided the jury with written directions which clearly set out the elements of each partial defence. The written and oral directions made clear the distinction between the two partial defences. Since the presence or absence of reasonable proportionality is not a separate element of provocation, there was no need for his Honour to specifically refer to it just because self-defence had been raised by the appellant. 
     
      
    34 The “circumstances of the case” upon which the appellant really relied are the remarks of the Crown in a context where self-defence was also being relied upon. In order to assess whether this complaint has been made out, one needs to look at what in fact was said by the Crown, not only in the context of self-defence having been raised by the appellant, but in the overall context of the trial. 
     
      
    35 The first passage relied upon by the appellant (para [25]) does not convey the meaning sought to be placed on it. It is at most an introductory remark by the Crown seeking to summarise in an anticipatory way the directions to be given by his Honour. It contains within it its own disclaimer in that it stresses the paramount position of his Honour in giving such directions. 
     
      
    36 There is in any event no error in that summary of principle by the Crown. The appellant’s submission that it erroneously stressed actions rather than intent, involves a strained interpretation of what was actually said. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the Crown’s remarks went no further than to paraphrase the requirements of s23(2)(b) and would have been so understood by the jury. Those remarks by the Crown required no explanation or direction by his Honour. 
     
      
    37 The second set of remarks upon which the appellant relied (para [27]) are at best ambiguous. They could carry the meaning sought to be placed upon them by the appellant if one stressed the words “warrant” and “kind of treatment”. Alternatively, in their context they could be regarded as doing no more than to emphasise the point which the Crown was seeking to make in its submissions - that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could induce an ordinary person to lose self-control. 
     
      
    38 That they were more likely to be understood by the jury in the latter way is clear from the earlier passage where the same example was given by the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is the provocation that the accused claims that acted upon him? One is, he says, the deceased told him, “Why did you insult my wife?” Now, if somebody was to confront another person and say, “Why did you insult my wife?”, whether that would result in his being provoked, here again, there is no evidence as to who started hitting whom.” (T.508.18-.24) 
        
       
      
    39 That seems to be the interpretation given to the remarks by senior counsel appearing for the appellant at trial where the following was submitted on behalf of the appellant, apparently in response to those remarks. 
     
      
       
        
        “Provocation arises where there is conduct of the deceased that causes a loss of self control in the accused. You don’t just look at – as the Crown has suggested – what was said and done on that day. You are entitled to look at actions between the two people on occasions before that. And, in this case, in my submission to you, the point you start at is the refusal to shake hands. The second incident you’d look at would be the confrontation at the Savocas – all of that as background to what happened on that day, and the context in which you must look at what happened between the accused and the deceased on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        So, you don’t just look at, as you might with two strangers, someone walking up and saying, “You insulted my wife”, boom. You look at it in the context of the relationship that these two men had, and the things that had gone on between them leading up to this fateful day, you might think.” (T.526.1-20) 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour in his directions also appears to have reached a similar conclusion as to the effect of the Crown’s remarks. When summarising the Crown case his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You would still be satisfied that Mr Basile’s acts were not such that they could have induced an ordinary person, in the position of Mr Disano, to have so far lost his self control as to the form the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Basile.” (SU 24.9) 
        
       
      
    41 There is no doubt that the remarks by the Crown could have been better expressed. At worst the remarks were equivocal and could bear the interpretation sought to be placed upon them by the appellant. Nevertheless, the remarks formed one sentence of a thirteen page address. They were not repeated by his Honour in his directions to the jury, and were not subject to any criticism or request for redirection by senior counsel then appearing for the appellant. The submissions by the Crown were followed by those of senior counsel for the appellant and by his Honour’s directions, both of which correctly stated the law as to provocation. His Honour repeatedly directed the jury that the s23(2)(b) issue was whether an ordinary person could have lost self-control in the manner described in that paragraph. In that regard the observations in R v ITA (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [90] are apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The atmosphere at a criminal trial is not easy to assess on appeal. Counsel at trial are well placed to determine whether, in the light of the way in which the case has been run, particular directions to the jury are defective. A failure to raise objections at the close of the judge’s summing up is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of its fairness and adequacy.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Szabo 
       (at [41]). 
       
      
    42 Even if his Honour did fail to specifically correct the suggested misstatement by the Crown, that failure did not result in an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice. The circumstances of the case did not make it necessary, nor was his Honour required to give an express direction that provocation was not negatived by a lack of reasonable proportionality between the accused’s conduct and the deceased’s conduct. On the evidence before the jury, the case for provocation was tenuous and conviction was virtually inevitable. It is of some significance that although raised on his behalf at trial, the appellant did not claim provocation in his statements to the police or Mr Gangi. Those statements stressed self-defence. While such a failure by the appellant to testify as to a loss of self-control does not prevent the partial defence of provocation being raised, it is important in the context of the whole trial when considering what effect the alleged incorrect remarks by the Crown would have had on the jury. 
     
      
    43 Accordingly, even if the remarks by the Crown carried the possibility that they may have been misunderstood and accordingly misused by the jury, (and I am of the opinion that they did not), the appellant was represented by senior counsel who did not seek to correct the remarks or seek a direction to that effect from his Honour. This could have been because she did not understand the remarks in context to be inconsistent with s23, or it may have been for other forensic reasons. An important issue in the trial was whether the most significant act of provocation occurred at all, ie whether the deceased threw the first punch. The veracity of the account of the appellant on this matter came under significant challenge. Senior counsel for the appellant may have thought that raising the question of proportionality would have had the effect of attracting attention to both that factual issue and the injuries actually sustained by the deceased. 
     
      
    44 For the above reasons, even if the remarks by the Crown are to be given the effect submitted on behalf of the appellant, I am not satisfied that any injustice has occurred and I would deny leave pursuant to rule 4. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Katrina Margaret Rawlings seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Marien DCJ on 17 March 2005. Ms Rawlings stood trial in the Campbelltown District Court before a Jury on an indictment containing six counts. She was found guilty on each count. The indictment may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         That on 20 November 2002, she had possession of 45 litres of the precursor (hypophosphorus acid) for the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) (s24A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) (""the Act""). 
         
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $220,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        That on 21 November 2002, she had possession of five litres of the same drug (s25A(1) of the Act). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3:  
        That between 11 and 15 December 2002, she supplied a prohibited drug (cannabis) (s25(1) of the Act). 
         
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $220,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4:  
        That between 6 and 9 December 2002, she supplied a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) (s25(1) of the Act). 
         
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5: 
         That between 7 and 8 December 2002, she supplied a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine)(s25(1) of the Act). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6 
        : That between 7 and 8 December 2002, she supplied a prohibited drug (MDMA or ecstasy) (s25(1) of the Act). 
         
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000. 
        
       
      
    3 His Honour, Marien DCJ, sentenced Ms Rawlings as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Imprisonment comprising a non parole period of 4 years, to commence on 17 March 2005 and to expire on 16 March 2009, with a total sentence of 7 years, to expire on 16 March 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years, to commence on 17 March 2005 and expire on 16 March 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3:  
        Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months, to commence on 17 March 2006 and expire on 16 September 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4 to 6:  
        Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years, to commence on 17 March 2008 and expire on 16 March 2010. 
        
       
      
    4 The total term of imprisonment, therefore, was seven years with a non parole period of five years. 
     
      
    5 Before dealing with the submissions made on behalf of Ms Rawlings, I should describe the circumstances in which the offences were committed. 
     
      
       
      The Offences. 
       
      
    6 Ms Katrina Rawlings is the sister of a person who will be referred to as ""MRN"". MRN had a motor sports business. On 30 October 2002, Ms Rawlings approached a chemical supplier, Crown Scientific Laboratories, seeking a chemical which was a precursor capable of being used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. She was obliged to complete an End User Declaration. She stated that she was the administrative manager of Down Under Motor Sports and that the precursor would be used as a ""cleaning product"". There was evidence at the trial, which the jury plainly accepted, that it would be highly improbable that such a substantial quantity of that chemical would be required for that purpose. 
     
      
    7 Having made the declaration, Ms Rawlings later the same day sent a fax to the supplier. She asked that her order by doubled from 25 litres to 50 litres. The cost was $10,600, which she paid. 
     
      
    8 The size of the order aroused the suspicions of the suppliers. They notified the police. The police arranged for surveillance. On 20 November 2002 and again on 21 November, Ms Rawlings was photographed at the premises of Crown Scientific Laboratories taking delivery of the 50 litres. On each occasion she was followed. She delivered the precursor to her brother. 
     
      
    9 On 20 December 2002, a search warrant was executed on her brother's premises. The precursor was found intact. The manufacturing process had not yet begun. 
     
      
    10 The offence was plainly very serious, and so regarded by his Honour. It was, as he said, a ""vast quantity"" of the precursor (ROS 10). A large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine under the Schedule to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is one kilogram. His Honour said this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""However, in considering the objective seriousness of the offence in this case it is highly relevant to consider that the precursor possessed by the offender with an intention by her that it be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine was capable of producing forty times the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine under Schedule 1 of the Act."" 
        
       
      
    11 It was submitted by counsel for Ms Rawlings, in the course of the sentencing proceedings, that his Honour should approach the matter upon the basis that Ms Rawlings was, in reality, a courier for her brother. His Honour, correctly in my view, rejected that submission. He described the role of Ms Rawlings in these words: (ROS 13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence is clearly that she was something more than a courier. She was the one who completed the End User Declarations. She was the one who negotiated for the purchase of the precursors. She was the one who paid for the precursors and she was the one who collected the precursors. Clearly her role was something higher than being a mere courier."" 
        
       
      
    12 The offence demonstrated planning. The motive was financial gain, either for herself or some other person (or both). His Honour characterised the offending behaviour in counts 1 and 2 as ""at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness"" (ROS 11). Ms Rawlings maintains her innocence. She told a psychiatrist that she had been convicted ""on a technicality"". There has been no real acceptance of responsibility and no remorse. 
     
      
    13 The remaining counts (counts 3 to 6) concerned the supply by Ms Rawlings and her brother of various drugs between 6 and 15 December 2002. The quantities, in each case, were relatively small. The Crown relied principally upon telephone calls which had been lawfully intercepted and text messages passing between Ms Rawlings and her brother. His Honour described these calls as follows: (ROS 4/5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Those calls clearly demonstrated that at a time very close to when the offender was in possession of the precursor that she was deeply involved in the business of supplying prohibited drugs including methylamphetamine with her brother, [MRN]."" 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour added that, although the quantity of drug involved in respect of each count was small, the offences were nonetheless still very serious. They were the more serious because each was part of a continuing course of criminal conduct. 
     
      
       
      The Subjective Case. 
       
      
    15 Ms Rawlings was born on 28 April 1971. She was 31 years at the time of the offences and almost 34 years when sentenced. She married at the age of 18 years. The marriage was characterised by domestic violence. She had three children who, at the time of sentence, were 13, 12 and 10 years. 
     
      
    16 Ms Rawlings told the Probation and Parole Service that she first tried cannabis at the age of 15 years. By the time she was 18 she was using it daily. Having had children, however, she ceased using it except recreationally.  
     
      
    17 Ms Rawlings was examined by Dr Wilcox, Psychiatrist. She told Dr Wilcox that, after the birth of her last child, she increasingly resorted to drugs and alcohol to cope with an unhappy marriage. In 2000 her husband had an accident. He was unable to work. Whereas Ms Rawlings had worked from time to time before her husband's accident, she was then required to seek fulltime employment. She told Dr Wilcox that when she did so ""things started to fall apart"". Her employer dismissed her in December 2001. Although she was reinstated, in the period before her reinstatement, she drank heavily, such that her husband ordered her to leave the family home. She ultimately gave up work in April 2002. 
     
      
    18 Ms Rawlings also told Dr Wilcox that before her marriage break up she had been depressed. She described her symptoms, which included depression, sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, lack of motivation and periods of tearfulness. Dr Wilcox expressed the view that she was, at that time, suffering from a major depression. 
     
      
    19 Having left work in April 2002, Ms Rawlings' life became more chaotic. She had no contact with the children after January when she was ordered to leave the family home. In June 2002, she took a significant overdose of prescribed drugs. She was admitted to the Campbelltown Hospital. 
     
      
    20 Upon her discharge from hospital, Ms Rawlings endeavoured unsuccessfully to see the children once more. At the time she did so she was intoxicated. Her husband later sought an interim Apprehended Violence Order. The order was granted and, indeed, Ms Rawlings was later charged with having resisted an officer in the execution of his duty and with a breach of the Apprehended Violence Order. The charges ultimately came before the Campbelltown Local Court on 6 November 2002 and were dismissed under s32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. 
     
      
    21 Ms Rawlings made a second attempt at suicide shortly after her discharge from the Campbelltown Hospital. She then saw her local doctor. He prescribed anti-depressant medication which significantly helped her. In July 2002, she began seeing a psychologist twice weekly at first, and then less frequently, which was also beneficial. She ceased seeing the psychologist in August 2002. 
     
      
    22 In October 2002, the Department of Housing provided Ms Rawlings with accommodation. She told Dr Wilcox that by October ""she was becoming more stable"". It should be noted that the offending conduct occurred between 20 November and 15 December 2002. In that context, Marien DCJ said this: (ROS 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is, in my view, appropriate to give some weight to the background of depression, the breakdown of her marriage, the stressors she was suffering in relation to not having contact with her children and her drug and alcohol problems, but in my view those matters whilst, as I say, should be given some weight, do not call for significant weight to be placed upon them in this case. In particular, as I say, I refer to the statement by the offender to Dr Wilcox that, by October 2002, she was more stable."" 
        
       
      
    23 Ms Rawlings had no previous convictions. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    24 The Notice of Appeal raised two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence failed to reflect his Honour's finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    25 It is convenient to deal with the second ground first. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Was the sentence excessive? 
       
      
    26 Complaint is made concerning his Honour's remarks on the subject of Ms Rawlings' good character and the weight that should be afforded to that aspect. His Honour said this: (ROS 7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I accept that prior to the commission of these offences the offender was a person of good character. That is also confirmed by the various testimonials which were tendered on her behalf and which I have noted."" 
        
       
      
    27 Having referred to Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 and s21A(3)(e) and (f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour said this: (ROS 9/10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my view, whilst I must to some extent take into account by way of mitigation the prior good character of the offender, it cannot be afforded full weight by way of mitigation in this case. That is because her prior good character assisted her or enabled her to commit the offences in relation to counts one and two. She was required, in ordering the precursors, to complete an End User Declaration which required her, because she was to collect the precursor herself, to provide details of her identity and a copy of her driver's licence. Clearly, had the offender had prior criminal convictions, she would have realised that she may well arouse suspicions that she was purchasing the precursor for an illicit purpose (see  
        R v Leroy 
         (1984) 13 A Crim R 469). The evidence in the trial was that the Declaration is an important document for manufacturers because, if it elicits any suspicion, the police are contacted which is exactly what happened in this case."" 
        
       
      
    28 Counsel for the applicant argued that Ms Rawlings ought to have had the full benefit of her good character since there was no evidence that she, herself, was aware of the advantage which her position afforded. 
     
      
    29 The authorities make it clear that the importance of good character will vary according to the nature and circumstances of the offence. In Ryan v The Queen (supra), McHugh J said this, in the context of sexual offences against young boys: (para 33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Sentencing is not a mathematical process ( 
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 [46]). Various factors have to be weighed. The otherwise good character of the prisoner is one of them. It is a mitigating factor that the sentencing judge is bound to consider. But the nature and circumstances of the offences for which he or she is being sentenced is a countervailing factor of the utmost importance. The nature of the offences for which the appellant was being sentenced meant that his otherwise good character could only be a small factor to be weighed in the sentencing process."" 
        
       
      
    30 In the context of a drug courier, Street CJ (Glass JA and Yeldham J agreeing) made the following observation in R v Leroy ((1984) 13 A Crim R 469), suggesting an objective test: (at 474-475) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court and other criminal courts have said on many occasions that, in the drug traffic in particular, the circumstances that the accused person has a clear earlier record will have less significance than in other fields of crime. Very frequently, those selected to play some part in the chain of drug trafficking, as the appellant plainly enough was, are selected because their records, their past and their lifestyles are not such as to attract suspicion. 
        
       
       
        
        It is this in particular which has led the courts to take in the case of drug trafficking a view which does not involve the same degree of leniency being extended to first offenders."" 
        
       
      
    31 In R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527, Howie J (Simpson J agreeing) identified some of the factors which operate to afford less weight to prior good character on sentence:  
     
      
       
        
        ""[21] It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining this appeal to consider the circumstances in which a court may legitimately determine that it will give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. Generally speaking such a situation might arise where general deterrence is important, the particular offence before the court is serious and it is one frequently committed by persons of good character. Another situation may be where the prior good character of the offender has enabled him or her to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed. 
        
       
       
        
        [22] Less weight might also be given to prior good character in a case where there is a pattern of repeat offending over a significant period of time. That will frequently be the case in child sexual assault offences because such offences are often committed during a period of an ongoing relationship between the offender and the complainant."" 
        
       
      
    32 Here, Ms Rawlings' brother had an extensive drug related criminal record, as she well knew. She had no such record. She was obliged to produce her driving licence and complete a Declaration before the drug was supplied. It may be inferred, in the context of such a large order, that she well understood why it was she, rather than her brother, who was approaching the supplier. But whether that be right or wrong, the class of offence, where the presentable nature and character of the offender was an aspect of the plan, made it appropriate for his Honour to take the approach he did. The offences, individually and collectively, were serious. General deterrence was of the utmost importance. The sentence was not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    33 I would dismiss ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The ratio of the non parole period to the total sentence. 
       
      
    34 His Honour having specified appropriate sentences for each offence, as required by Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, considered the question of concurrence, accumulation and totality. He took the view, correctly in my opinion, that there should be some accumulation. The counts relating to the possession of the precursor (counts 1 and 2) were quite different from the ongoing supply of small quantities of various drugs (counts 3 to 6). Having determined the sentence of 7 years with a non parole period of 4 years on count 1, his Honour then imposed fixed terms of 2 years on counts 4 to 6, delaying the commencement of these terms so that the expiry date was 1 year after the end of the non parole period on count 1. Hence, the effective parole period for the sentence overall was reduced from 3 years to 2 years (from 7 years with a non parole period of 4 years on count 1, to 7 years with a non parole period of 5 years overall). 
     
      
    35 The applicant complains that such an accumulation was inconsistent with his Honour's finding of special circumstances, which was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... there are special circumstances warranting a variation between the normal ratio between the non parole period and the term of the sentence. That submission I clearly accept because this is the first time the offender is to serve a custodial sentence 
        . I also take into account her need for extended supervision to deal with her outstanding drug and alcohol problems and her problems with depression.  
         All of those matters, in my view, constitute special circumstances warranting variation of the statutory ratio."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    36 Had his Honour applied the statutory ratio, the non parole period on a 7 year sentence would have been 5 years and 3 months, as opposed to the 5 years fixed by his Honour. 
     
      
    37 I accept that the sentence, as ultimately fashioned, did not adequately reflect the finding of special circumstances which his Honour made and which was certainly warranted. In particular, it did not reflect the need for extended supervision. Although the sentence was painstaking in its findings and expression, I accept that in the mathematics at the end, there was error. The applicant should therefore be resentenced. 
     
      
       
      Resentence. 
       
      
    38 An affidavit was filed by the applicant documenting her progress in the year since she was sentenced. She has undertaken many courses and sought to address her drug and alcohol problem. She has used her time well. 
     
      
    39 For the purposes of resentencing, I adopt each of his Honour's findings, including the finding of special circumstances. The only change that I would propose is in respect of the accumulation. The accumulation should begin 6 months earlier so that the fixed terms end 6 months earlier. The non parole period, which the applicant must serve, would then become 4 years and 6 months, which is still a significant period and adequate for the purposes of general and personal deterrence (cf Howie J in Bushara v R [2006] NSWCCA 8, para [34]). She will be eligible for parole on 16 September 2009 and, if granted at that time, the parole period will be 2 years and 6 months. The sentence will expire on 16 March 2012. 
     
      
       
      Letter from the Applicant. 
       
      
    40 The applicant was present when the appeal was argued. The Court reserved its decision. Shortly thereafter each Judge sitting on the appeal received a letter from Ms Rawlings complaining that certain issues had not been canvassed by Senior Counsel appearing for her. Three points were made. Two of these fundamentally quarrelled with the jury's verdict that she was guilty, and are irrelevant. The third matter was an issue of parity. Her brother received a shorter sentence in respect of a similar offence. He had been sentenced by Maguire DCJ on 27 April 2005 at the Campbelltown District Court. The charges against him included the possession of the precursor with an intent to use that chemical for the manufacture of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    41 Ms Rawlings' letter was passed by the Registry to counsel for Ms Rawlings and the Crown. Counsel for the applicant was invited to indicate whether she had any further application. Counsel responded that there was no such application. 
     
      
    42 For the purposes of determining what should be done concerning the applicant's letter, I have briefly examined the remarks on sentence of Maguire DCJ in respect of her brother. He was charged with a number of other offences. The sentencing Judge was provided with the remarks of Marien DCJ relating to Ms Rawlings. He adverted to the issue of parity, considering that issue in the context of other charges against her brother.43 The issue of parity was not argued before us. I understand MRN's sentence is the subject of an application for leave to appeal. In the circumstances it is not appropriate at this stage to reopen the appeal to deal with the issue of parity which Ms Rawlings has raised. I propose that leave to appeal should be given, but only in respect of the application on this appeal (cf Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295). 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    44 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal given and the appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. The sentences on counts 1, 2 and 3 confirmed. 
       
       
      3. The sentences on counts 4, 5 and 6 quashed and, in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced in respect of each count to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 17 September 2007 and expire on 16 September 2009.

    JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Stephen John Riddell (“the appellant”) appeals to the District Court against a finding of guilt made against him in respect of an offence alleged pursuant to s. 9A(1)(f)(ii) Passports Act 1938 (the “Act”).2 The offence for which he was convicted alleged that he: 
     
      
      “ 
      between 9 November 2001 and 16 November 2001 
      , at Sydney, did have in his possession or under his control within Australia a document (not being a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country) that purported to be a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country, in that he did have in his possession or under his control a document titled ‘New Hebrides Passport-Passeport’ …. in the name Stewart James Riddell, date of birth 20 January 1964”. 
      
    3 The proceedings in the Local Court continued between November 2004 and March 2005, however when the matter was concluded in March 2005 the appellant failed to appear and the finding of guilt was made in his absence. He was apparently found guilty of a number of offences. On appeal to the District Court against those convictions, leave was granted to appeal against his conviction on only one of the charges dealt with at the Local Court. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“the respondent”) opposes the appeal and seeks that it be dismissed.The Issues4 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant did not contest that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the relevant document the subject of the charge (“the passport” issued by “the government of the New Hebrides”) was “in (his) possession or under (his) control”, that the document was in the name of “Stewart James Riddell” and that it described itself as a “Passport” and declared itself to be the “property of New Hebrides” issued by “the competent authorities in New Hebrides …. “. There is no dispute that the photograph contained within the “passport” was that of the appellant and the document had affixed within it various “visa” stamps, which may be evidence that the document had been used as a “Passport”.5 It was established from the evidence, that “the government of New Hebrides”, did not exist on the date of issue of the passport (6 September 1997). In fact, as at that date, the former British/French “colony” or “condominium” of “New Hebrides” had already become the Republic of Vanuatu, that the document in the possession of the accused had not been issued by the Republic of Vanuatu and that the document did not belong either to the Republic of Vanuatu or the formerly constituted “condominium” or colony of “New Hebrides”. New Hebrides had been jointly administered by France and Great Britain between 1906 and 1980. 6 As the appeal was conducted the two critical issues for decision are: 
     
      
      i. Properly construed did s.9A(1)(f) (ii) of the Act, extend to prohibit possession of “passports” issued by fictitious governments: ie could such a document “purport” to be issued by  
      the 
       government of  
      a 
       foreign country that did not exist (emphasis added), and if so, 
      
     
     
      
      ii. if so, was such a provision within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth of Australia to legislate? 
      
    7 The appellant essentially contended that, properly construed, the document must be issued by a real political entity not a fictitious one and that the Commonwealth of Australia had no constitutional power to prohibit possession of documents that on their face could not have been issued by the existing government of a foreign country or one that had never existed. The parties have sent out s.78B Judiciary Act notices but no other parties have intervened.The Relevant Legislative Provision.8 S.9A(1) Passports Act 1938 provided, as at November 2001; 
     
      
      1) A person who: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) in connection with travel or identification, uses an Australia passport that has been cancelled; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) in connection with travel or indemnification, uses an Australia passport that was issued to another person; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) being a person to whom an Australia passport has been issued, permits another person to use that passport in connection with travel or identification; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (d) has in his or her possession or under his or her control an Australia passport that was not issued to him or her; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) has in his or her possession or under his or her control: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) an Australian passport that has been falsified; or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (ii) a document (not being an Australian passport) that purports to be an Australian passport; 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (f)  
        has in his or her possession or under his or her control within Australia 
        : 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country, being a passport that has been falsified; or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (ii)  
          a document (not being a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country) that purports to be a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country; or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (g) intentionally does an act that causes the defacing or destruction of an Australian passport; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      is guilty of an offence and is punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years. 
      
    9 (The relevant part of the provision emphasised).10 No issue of “reasonable excuse” as set out in s.9A(2) arose for consideration in this matter. S.9A(1)(f)(ii) is hereafter referred to as “the relevant provision”.11 The Act is described in its title as “an Act relating to Passports”. It has extra territorial operation, relating “to acts, matters and things outside Australia” and “to all persons irrespective of their nationality or citizenship”, unless the contrary appears (s.4A).12 S.5(4) states that a reference in ss.9A(1)(f) and 9B(b) “to a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country shall be read as including a reference to a document of identity issued on behalf of the government of a foreign country for travel purposes …”.13 The Act has provisions relating to the issue of “Passports” in Australia and regulation of possession of such “Passports” ss.5, 7, 7A etc, 8, 8A, 9 of the Act. S.9A is entitled: “Offences relating to improper use or possession of passports etc”. S.9A(1)(a) – (e) and (g) create offences relating to the use and abuse of Australian passports. S.9(f) creates offences involving possession of relevant “documents” within Australia issued or purportedly issued by the government of a foreign country.14 S.9B of the Act creates offences relating to “Falsifying foreign passports etc”, within Australia. S.9B(a) creates the offence of “falsify(ing) a passport issued by and on behalf of the government of a foreign country”. S.9B(b) creates the offence of, “mak(ing) a document that is fake with intent that the false document may be used, acted on or accepted as if it were a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country” (emphasis added).15 Ss.9C,10 create further unrelated offences and s.11 is concerned with “Prosecution of Offences”. The remaining provisions in the Act need not be referred to as they appear to have no relevance. The Act was substantially amended by the “Anti-Terrorism Act (No 3) 2004” including a definition for a “foreign passport” as “a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country” and a definition for “foreign travel document”. The Act was effectively “split” by repealing ss.9A(1)(f) and 9B, to create offences as to “Australian Passports” (Part 1) and as to “Foreign travel documents” (Part 3 ss.18-22).16 In 2005 the Parliament enacted the Australian Passports Act. Reference will be made below to relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901.The First Issue17 Bearing in mind that the document in the possession of the appellant was not issued by the government of a foreign country that existed at the time of issue and was thus a false document, the question that arose was whether it could relevantly “purport to be a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country”. The supposed issuing “government” did not exist at the time of the offence and had not existed in the manner represented by the document since 1980, but the document had all the characteristics of a “Passport” with standard “representations” as to identity, purpose and visa stamps, some of which, at least, had hallmarks of fabrication. Evidence was given that the document did not look like one that would have been issued by New Hebrides or Vanuatu.The Submissions18 The appellant submitted that he should not have been convicted of an offence “as there is no government and no foreign country of New Hebrides” that could have issued the document to him and that therefore there could be no document “purporting” to have be issued by the government of a foreign country, being New Hebrides. The appellant traced the legislative history of the Passports Act, stating that the definition of “passport” under the Act was “a document of identity issued from official sources whether within or outside of Australia and having the characteristics of a passport”. S.9A was inserted by a 1979 amendment, introduced with s.4A, which provided that the Act applied to “acts, matters and things outside of Australia” as well as “all persons irrespective of their nationality or their citizenship”. It was submitted that from it’s enactment the focus of an offence under s.9A(f)(ii) was to find a country that was a country “other than Australia” (emphasis added).19 The appellant noted that in 1984, s.5 of the Act was amended to introduce ss(4) which provided that: 
     
      
      “a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country shall be read as including a reference to a document of identity issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country for travel purposes (whether or not also issued for any other purpose)”. 
      
    20 Reference was made to amendments in 2004 and 2005 which repealed s.9A of the 1938 Act, and instituted the Australian Passports Act 2005, particularly s.20 of the new Act as earlier outlined.21 The appellant submits principally, and repeatedly, that the literal construction of s.9A(1)(f)(ii) involves construing the provision to include a document not actually issued by a foreign country but that purports or represents to have been issued by the government of a foreign country (emphasis added), that is “an identifiable foreign country from which the document purports to have been issued”. Relying upon the Macquarie Dictionary definition of the word “purport” it is submitted that the document must “profess, claim or convey” the meaning of being a document issued by the government of a foreign country that is an identifiable country, that is a “real”, not “a fictitious”, country.22 The appellant seeks to draw comfort from the wording of s.20(4) of the subsequently enacted Australian Passports Act 2005, with its specific reference to an identifiable country. Each provision it is submitted has “the intent” that there is “a possibility of a government having issued the document”, because “an element of the offence is that the particular government has not issued the document”. It is submitted that the relevant provision, like the provision in the 2005 Act, made it clear that the intention was to make it improper to possess a document that could be taken to have been issued by a foreign government (emphasis added).23 The appellant argues that as the document has no origin from, or connection to, a particular (ie. a real) government of a foreign country, it did not fall within the ambit of s.9A of the 1938 Act. It is submitted that the “definite articles” used twice in the relevant provision require that there be as a matter of objective fact an existing government of an existing foreign country capable of having issued the document. Construction of the provision in the context of the legislative history does not lend its support to the contention that the legislative intent was not to preclude possession of documents issued by fictitious countries but to prohibit possession of documents that appeared as if they were issued by a particular foreign country.24 The respondent to the appeal in summary submits on this issue that the evidence establishes that the document found in the appellant’s possession “was not a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country”. It is submitted that the “first limb” of the relevant provision is thus satisfied. The respondent states that, the “second limb” is also satisfied in that the document “purports to be a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country”, primarily because of the characteristics of the document.25 The issue of fact clearly established from the evidence, it is submitted by the respondent, was that the document “purported to be” a document issued by or on behalf of the “government of New Hebrides”. The issue of whether the document was “fake” and “noticeably so” is not to point. Further, it is submitted by the respondent that the appellant seeks to read further words into the relevant provision ie that the document has to “look like” or could “possibly” have been issued by the government of a foreign country”. This construction is not in accordance with the words of the section. The relevant provision is concerned with two alternatives, a document that is issued by the government of a foreign country and one that is not, but is purportedly so. It is not a matter concluded by expert opinion. It is sufficient for the tribunal of fact to be satisfied that the document “purports to be” issued by a foreign government.26 In construing the provision in its legislative context it is noted by the respondent that s.9A(1)(f) is the only provision, within the section, that deals with passports (or documents) in connection with “foreign countries”. A reference to “foreign country” it is submitted should be taken to mean any country (whether or not an independent sovereign state) outside Australia and the external territories” (s.22(1) Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)). Further, in the legislative context s.9A(1)(f)(i), it is submitted “essentially”, deals with the subject of falsified or official passports that have been tampered with or forged. This separate sub provision is significant given the way the appellant puts his case.27 It is submitted by the respondent that the Court is required to give a “purposive approach” to the construction of the relevant provision (see s.15AA Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)). To ascertain the mischief that the provision was intended to cured it is submitted “it is legitimate to have recourse to extrinsic materials” and that it is submitted that rather than prefer the “literal meaning” of the words, giving rise to “inconvenience or improbability of result”, the Court should prefer an “alternative” construction that more closely conforms to legislative intent (Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320-321). It is submitted that this is the “golden rule” of statutory construction which makes no distinction between penal and non penal statutes. As I understood the submissions of the respondent it was conceded that the supposed “literal”, or as the respondent calls it, the “narrow”, interpretation may accord the provision the meaning the appellant contends.28 It is submitted that the relevant provision applies to documents that are “fabricated”, relying upon the second reading speech of the Minister who introduced the provision (Mr Peacock in the House of Representatives) and his representative in the Senate (Senator Carrick). The provision was described when the Bill was introduced as being one “ushering in” offences relating to “the improper use or possession of an Australian passport, forgery and fabrication of passports and the wrongful use of passports” (eg. Senator Carrick – Hansard p1219 – 3 April 1979).29 The respondent submits that a fabrication is established when the item is “made” and “it purports to be that which it is not”. It is submitted that a document issued officially by a foreign government, but which is in some way altered or tampered with, so as to make it look like an official document, would be a forgery that may fall within the ambit of the relevant provision but more naturally would fall within s.9A(f)(i). It is submitted that the making of a document that simply “purports to be a passport” officially issued by a foreign government, enlivens the provision and no legislative purpose is served by a “narrow” or “literal” construction.30 Further, it is submitted that the relevant provision is “a possession offence” and does not require proof of intent. The respondent referred repeatedly to s.9B(1)(f) (sic - I take this to be a reference to s.9B(b)), which is concerned with the “making of a document with intent to use it”, as relevant to the construction of the relevant provision (Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 (at 381-382)). 31 S.9B(b) as earlier noted relevantly provides: 
     
      
       “A person who within Australia  
      makes 
       a document that is false with intent that the false document may be used, acted on or accepted  
      as if it were 
       a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country other than Australia is guilty of an office”  
      (emphasis added) 
      . 
      
    32 It is submitted that it is a provision that “naturally complements” the relevant provision, that it more “explicitly embraces the concept of fabrication”. It is submitted that it would be odd if s.9B(b) extended to proscribe fabrications, yet the relevant provision did not also so extend to fabrications. It is submitted that the words “false” and “as it were”, really mean the same thing as “purports to be”, importing a comparison between a document that has, as a matter of fact, been properly and officially issued by a foreign government and a document that has been made (ie a fabrication) which conveys or represents that fact, but which has not been officially issued by a foreign government. Further, the operation of s.9B(b), requires no necessity by the person who makes the document, to have knowledge as to whether the document might represent a “true document” properly issued by the government of a foreign country. The person’s purpose is simply to create a document that will carry with it the false representation that the document carries the imprimatur of the government of a foreign country. It does not matter if the country exists or not.33 It is submitted by the respondent that there is “no justification to construe the relevant section in an inconsistent manner”. Neither the relevant provision nor s.9B(b) depends upon a requirement that the foreign country actually exists at the relevant time. It is submitted that the literal construction advanced by the appellant requires a “temporal requirement”, which would produce “an inconvenient or improbable result” ie the offence would not be committed before the creation of Vanuatu, but not so afterwards. It is submitted by the respondent that the literal construction requires the existence of a government of a foreign country, at the time of the possession of the document, whereas there is no time requirement in the provision.34 Further, it is submitted that the defence of reasonable excuse, prevented an injustice arising out of a construction other than a “literal” construction ie a person who has a hobby of possessing or making “replicas” of passports or “fictional” passports.35 Finally, the respondent submits there is no ambiguity in the provision, however, even if there was, that it should be resolved in favour of the appellant represents “an outdated view of statutory construction”. The Court should give primacy to s.15AA Acts Interpretation Act 1901 so as to construe penal legislation purposefully (Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569, at 576, R v Lavender (2005) 79 ALJR 1337, at 1354, Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony (2005) 79 ALJR 1850, at 188). Only in “true ambiguity or doubt” should the provision be construed favourably. R v Bailey [2003] NSWCCA 361, should not be taken as holding to the contrary.36 The appellant in response to the Crown’s submission, reiterates previous submissions regarding the obvious fabrication the document represents and the need for the relevant passport under the relevant provision to be a document to be issued by a real government. It is submitted that the Crown’s reliance on s.22(1) Acts Interpretation Act 1901 is “misplaced” as the relevant provision speaks for itself, needs no assistance from the Interpretation Act. It is submitted that the Australian Passports Act (2005), demonstrates the regulation of foreign passports is an express use of the external affairs power and that s.20 of the new Act illuminates and informs a construction of the relevant provision as contended by the appellant. He contends also there is a legislative policy served by a “narrow construction”, that is to prevent potential liability to criminal sanctions upon possession of a “commercial gimmick which takes the form of a fabricated passport”. The true legislative policy should be identified as, “a concern” that a document that is “dressed up” in the colours of a presently constituted and identifiable “government of a foreign country” represents a threat that should be regulated. However there must be exceptions, including, for example, a traveller outside a nation who became that victim of “regime change”. A previously issued passport may no longer be valid but it would not be relevantly a “fabrication”. Further, if it is found that the relevant provision requires the Crown to establish not only that the document purport to be a passport, but also that the passport has a connection with the government of a foreign country, the “purposive” interpretation intended for by the Crown should be rejected. It is submitted that there is “no temporal” requirement in the section, the requirement is rather that the Crown identify which foreign country has purportedly issued the passport.The Second Issue:Constitutional Implications37 In addition to the central proposition that the relevant provision was concerned with the alteration to passports issued by a particular foreign country, the appellant submits that constitutional considerations make it clear that the legislative intent was to prevent the possession of a document having a connection to, or origin from, an existing (at some time) foreign government.38 The appellant cites observations in R v Sharkey (1949) 79 CLR 121 as authority for the proposition that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to “preserve peace, order and good government by the enactment of criminal law”. Citing Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Bank (1948) 76 CLR 1, it is submitted that the determination of the validity of the law, requires construing the law and determining it’s operation and effect and then to determine the relationship that the Act has to a subject matter in respect of which it is contended that the Commonwealth had power to make laws (at 186, per Latham CJ).39 The appellant argues that the “literal” construction it contends applies makes it clear that s.9A(1)(f)(ii) of the Act is concerned with documents that “look like or impersonate” those issued by a “particular foreign government”. Insofar as the provision regulates “documents that are not referrable to Australia”, particularly “documents that “look like” they had been issued by “the government of a foreign country” then the intended source of “power” is the “external affairs power”.40 It is submitted that this being so, bearing in mind that the ‘external affairs’ power can only be utilised to make laws with respect to; 
     
      
      i. matters of international law, 
      
     
     
      
      ii. matters external to Australia and 
      
     
     
      
      iii. Australia’s relations to and with other countries, (citing  
      Blackshield & Williams “Australian Constitutional Law and Theory 
       (2nd Ed)” Federation Press (1998) at 676-681). 
      
    41 None of these aspects of “external affairs power” arise if the provision is one that arises from the construction contended by the respondent.42 It is also submitted that the “law of passports” is a matter of “municipal” regulation, that the issue of a document that has not been issued by the government of a foreign country raises no matter “physically external” to Australia. Nor are there any characteristics of the appellant or the document itself that suggest that in a “geographical” sense the document has a connection to a place external to Australia and, as the document does not relevantly “look like” a document issued by a “particular foreign government” (contending that New Hebrides has never had the status of a “foreign country”, nor did it relevantly exist at the time of the issue of the passport), there was no issue that arose in relation to the regulation of Australia’s relationships with other nations.43 The appellant submits that as it is for Crown to demonstrate there is a sufficient application of Federal law to the Defendant, the Federal law may not apply in a particular circumstance if the essential factual or other criteria necessary for the law to operate under the Constitution is unfulfilled (citing Street v Queensland Bar Association (1989) 168 CLR 461: Bond v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 597).44 Thus, if the law appears unconstitutional, the operation of s.15A Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) will be relevant to ascertain if the legislation can be read down so that the potential invalidity does not arise. In this matter there is “no external affair” to establish a connection between the alleged offence and the external affairs power. So far as s.15A Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), is concerned it is submitted this would operate to construe the validity of the legislation only if the “passport” came from a presently existing foreign country from which the document purported to have been issued.45 With regard to any incidental power to legislate, the appellant submits that it arises in two situations, either attached to the grant of power itself to make it “effective” and that expressly granted in s.51(xxxix) Constitution Act (which grants power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to matters incidental to any power vested by the Commonwealth in the Parliament).46 It is submitted that the latter provision is of no assistance to the Crown because the legislative power incidental to the execution of executive power does not extend to the creation of the offences except where it is needed to protect the efficacy of the execution by the Executive Government of it’s powers and capacity (Davis v Commonwealth (1988) 166 CLR 79 (at 113 per Brennan J).47 Neither is there an incidental power, to make the grant of power effective, because of the “careful drafting” of the relevant provision, where the focus is “clearly upon recognition of documents that look like those issued by the government of a foreign country” (emphasis added). It is submitted that the purpose of the provision is to “harmonise” relations between Australia and “foreign countries” and that it serves no part of this purpose, even incidentally, for this provision to extend to prohibition against documents that look like those issued by non existent countries.48 The respondent, in response submits that at the time of the enactment of the legislation there was a “country” called New Hebrides, that is “(a) territory of …. a nation or state”, (Black’s Law Dictionary (8th Ed)), and was to be regarded as a “foreign country”, for the purposes of the interpretation of the relevant provision, applying s.22 Acts Interpretation Act 1901. In that provision “foreign country” is defined as “any country (whether or not an independent sovereign state) outside Australia and the external territories”.49 The Commonwealth submits that adopting the categories of circumstances relevant to the external power, the relevant provision “is a law with respect to matter external to Australia and Australia’s relations with foreign countries”. The external affairs power extends to “a place, person, matter or thing” outside the geographical limits of Australia then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase “external affairs” (Polyukovich v The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501- at 632, per Dawson J). The circumstances in which Australia or “foreign governments” authorise citizens to leave and re-enter respective territories was a matter concerning Australia’s relationships with foreign countries and the efficacy of the system of regulating passports is integral to Australia’s relations to other countries, “since the presence in this country of fabricated foreign passports will tend to undermine Australia’s ability to rely in, or place trust upon, foreign passports generally.”50 The second reading speeches, cited by the respondent, reinforced the notion that the general subject of passport regulation at the time the relevant provision was enacted, was not motivated by domestic concerns but rather with Australia’s relationships with and obligations to foreign countries.51 The respondent submits that if the relevant provision was concerned with persons, arriving in Australia with forged or tampered official government passports, then in 1979 when the provision was passed, Australia would have been concerned to ensure that citizens of the “country” known as “New Hebrides” did not enter or cross Australia’s aerial space without the official sanction of “the government of New Hebrides” and that that foreign country would be interested or concerned in an Australian resident having a document in his possession that would enable him to pass himself off as a resident of that foreign country or at least having the authority to leave and re enter that foreign country.52 The Crown contends that the provision is not merely limited to forgeries of officially issued passports, but “ fabrications”, where a document is created to represent that it has the sanction of a foreign country to leave and re enter that country. That the territory known as “New Hebrides” had changed it’s name and it’s political structure did not detract from the fact that this territory, with altered name and political structure, remains external to Australia. Alternatively, even if the relationship between Australia and New Hebrides was really concerned with Australia’s relationship with United Kingdom and/or France, the joint administrators of “New Hebrides”, that did not detract from, but rendered, a fortiori, the notion that there is an external affair.53 Further, it is also to be inferred that the current Vanuatuan government, should have an interest in, and concern with, documents purportedly issued by “the government” in its former name. The governing body of a foreign country, however that is named and whatever political structure may prevail from time to time, has an actual or potential interest or concern in Australian residents having documents that purportedly (but contrary to the fact) represent the holder of the document has the licence or the authority to travel out of that country when that licence or authority has not been given. It is submitted that the right to travel, leave and re-enter a country, is commonly considered as an incident of sovereignty and the Vanuatuan Government’s, actual or potential interest or concern in an Australian resident having in his possession a document purporting to be a New Hebrides passport is not likely to have ceased from the onset of independence. It makes no difference whether the passport was in the appellant’s possession in November 2001 (as was the case here) rather than the day after independence occurred, and the political system and name of the relevant territory changed.54 Additionally, the respondent submits that the provision was a valid exercise of the Parliament’s power in that the Parliament had legislative authority to pass laws in relation to “acts, matters and things the control of which was necessary to effectuate it’s main purpose” (Grannall v Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd (1955) 93 CLR 55 at 77). At the very least the provision should be construed as incidental to the external affairs power. There is at least an incidental power in regulating Australia’s relations with foreign countries to prohibit persons fabricating documents that purport to be passports issued by countries that previously went by another name. Further and alternatively, prohibiting persons from having in their possession “fake” foreign passports is said to be incident to the “immigration and/or aliens powers regulating the movement of non citizens into Australia and citizens out of Australia (Cuncliffe v The Commonwealth (1994) 182 CLR 272 - at 294-5, 315-26, 373-4 and 394-5). 55 In response it is submitted by the appellant that in effect the concern of the Commonwealth government with foreign passports is limited to their recognition. However, the issue of who should be eligible for passports and the type of passport that should be issued was a “municipal concern”, and thus fell outside the ambit of any “external affair”. It is submitted “there is no external affair (and no offence) where there is no foreign nation to be recognised”. Further, it is not an expression of “nationhood” for Australia to recognise foreign documents.Consideration of the IssuesStatutory Construction56 The provision to be construed is a penal provision. In R v Adams (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-8, the High Court said: 
     
      
      “No doubt, in determining whether an offence has been created or enlarged, the Court must be guided, as in other questions of interpretation, by the fair meaning of the language of the enactment, but when that language is capable of more than one meaning, or is vague or cloudy so that it’s denotation is uncertain and no more conclusion can be reached by consideration of the provisions and the subject matter of the legislation, then it ought no to be construed as extending any penal category”. 
      
    57 This view was recently approved in R v Bailey [2003] NSWCCA 361 at [24]. Although the relevant legislation to be construed in Bailey was not a penal statute, the ‘criminal’ law was required to enforce the legislation and thus considerations such as those in Adams were “unavoidable” [27].58 In Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 12 ALR 333, Justice Gibbs (at 339) observed: 
     
      
      “The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the meaning of the penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences.” 
      
    59 In Murphy v Farmer (1988) 165 CLR 19, at 28-29, the majority favoured the strict interpretation of the provision considered, “in favour of the subject”. In that judgment the majority approved the view, “that those who contend that [a] penalty may be inflicted must shew (sic) that the words of the Act distinctly enact that it should be incurred under the present circumstances. They must fail, if the words are merely equally capable of a construction that would, and one that would not, inflict the penalty” (at 29).60 These observations are however subject to more fundamental principles of statutory interpretation.61 S.15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, provides: 
     
      
       “In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferable to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.” 
      
    62 S.15AB of this Act provides that in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, regard may be had to extrinsic material, either to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning, taking into account it’s context and the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act or to determine the meaning of the provision when the provision is ambiguous or obscure or the ordinary meaning may lead to a result which is “manifestly absurd or is unreasonable”. In determining whether consideration should be given to such material, regard is to be had to the desirability to persons being able to rely upon the ordinary meaning conveyed by the test to the provision, taking into account it’s context and the Act and its purpose or object and the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.63 In Lavender v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1337, Kirby J (at 1355) observed that ‘strict’ interpretation was a rule of ‘last resort’, coming into operation when normal rules had ‘runout’, after firstly giving effect to the purpose of the legislation as expressed in the language of the legislation (at [93][94]). The authors of Pearce observe courts should not “depart from a strict application of the words of a penal provision” and courts should not extend a statute to cover a particular situation merely because it appears that the legislature has acted inadvertently (Pearce and Geddes “Statutory Interpretation in Australia” (5th Ed 2001)).64 Justice McHugh in Krakouer v The Queen (1998) 155 ALR 586 (at 600) further said: 
     
      
      “Still less should a Court ignore the clear words of a provision so as to give it a meaning that would or might make it easier to convict an accused person if the intention of the legislature is at best a matter of contestable opinion”. 
      
    65 These views, if they differ, are still subject to the “cardinal rule” of statutory interpretation that requires that the words of a statute be read in their proper context (Cooper Brooks (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 302,319-320: K & S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon and Gotch Limited (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 315) and “to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of ... the provisions of the statute” (Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority at 381) which are applicable here.66 Where the words or phrases in an Act are clear in their meaning they must be interpreted literally, unless “it would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconstancy with the rest (of the legislation), (Australian Boot Trade Employees Federation v Whybrow & Co (1910) 11 CLR 311 at 341). Courts may also take into account the consequences of competing interpretations so as to choose a reasonable rather than an “absurd” construction of the legislation (Bistricic v Rokov (1976) 11 ALR 129 – at 136 per Jacobs J.)67 In Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1, McHugh J (at 21) observed  
     
      
      “In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory meaning will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will constitute the “ordinary meaning” to be applied. If, the however, the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as “the ordinary meaning” and cannot prevail. It must give way to a construction which will promote the underlying purpose of object of the Act. … More over once a Court concludes that the literal or grammatical meaning of the provision does not conform to the legislative purposes ascertained from the statute as a whole including the policy which might be discerned from its provisions, it is entitled to give effect to that purpose by addition to, omission from or clarification of the particular provision …. “ 
      
     
     
      
      “But where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is “the ordinary meaning” to be applied. A Court cannot depart from the “ordinary meaning” of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies”  
      (at 22-23) 
      .  
      
    68 It is open to construe the relevant provision on one view as establishing that the document in the possession of the appellant, or under his control, was relevantly a document which was not a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country (because that “country” did not relevantly exist at the time of the offence or on the purported date of issue of the document), but was a document “that purports to be a passport issued by the government of a foreign country”. “Purports” I take to mean “professes, conveys or claims”, in other words, represents or holds itself out to be “a passport issued by the government of a foreign country”.69 Here the document held itself out to be a passport from the “country” known as “New Hebrides” with the identity of a real person in it (the appellant) and with various features consistent with a passport. I agree with the Crown’s submission that it was beside the point that an expert readily identified the document as a “fake”, not representing an official document of either “Vanuatu” or “New Hebrides”. That it was readily identifiable by that “expert” as such a document did not as such prevent the document “purporting” to be “a passport issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country”. The quality of the fabrication per se is also beside the point. The issue was what the document professed or claimed itself to be.70 “New Hebrides” had been up until 1980, subsequent to the creation of s.9A of the Act, a real place. It was relevantly a real “foreign country”, being a recognised discreet “territorial entity” (Oxford Dictionary) although not an “independent sovereign state” (s.22 Acts Interpretation Act 1901) I understood the evidence of Mr Longwah to be that the condominium had a “government”, ie. a form of system of rule, or an administering body that issued passports. That it did not exist as at 1997, the supposed date of issue, or in November 2001, the date of possession, may however not be determinative as to whether the document conveyed or claimed to be a passport of the government of a foreign country.71 The document had all the extrinsic features of an official government document and particularly a passport. It described itself to be a “Passport”. It stated “The President of New Hebrides requests and requires in the Name of the government of New Hebrides ….etc” (sic). The “Notes” of the ‘Passport’ state (at 2.) 
     
      
      “New Hebrides passports are issued by the competent Authorities in New Hebrides”. 
      
    72 That an expert from the Government of Vanuatu could identify it as a “fabrication”, did not mean that a person exercising official government functions relating to the use of passports in Australia or elsewhere would do so. As it was the document tendered at the hearing had other indicia of use as a travel document or a document of identity. For example there was a departure stamp from “British Guiana (sic) 18 October 1998”, and stamps for other locations including Noumea and elsewhere. Interestingly, there were arrival and departure stamps at “Port Villa” …. “New Hebrides (sic)” on dates when “New Hebrides” did not exist. Even assuming these latter entry and exit stamps were “fabrications”, they lend support for the proposition that the relevant document had the character of a “Passport”, relevantly issued by “the government of New Hebrides”. The issue is, whether this is the government of a foreign country for the purposes of the Section.73 One legislative context of the relevant provision is said to support the construction contended by the respondent. 9A(1)(f)(i) is a provision concerned with a real “passport” issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country that is “falsified”. The appellant’s ‘literal’ interpretation of the relevant provision may leave no “work (for the relevant provision) to do” for it given the terms of s.9A(1)(f)(i) depending upon the meaning of falsified. However, the ‘relevant provision’ is concerned in its terms with a different situation, that is a “document” (not a “passport”) that “purports (claims, conveys, professes) to be “a passport” issued on behalf of “the government of a foreign country”. That, in its normal meaning, without ambiguity, suggests “fabrications” of passports and their source as opposed to “real” passports that are falsified. Whether as to the appearance of the document or the authenticity of its issue.74 The Crown’s contention essentially is that it does not matter that the purported “government of a country” exists or not, it is the “purport” of the document that is the critical feature of the offence not whether the purport of the document is based on the existence of the particular government at the time of possession or even on the date of issue. The problem with this contention is that the provision would only have this meaning unambiguously if the word “passport” appearing for the second time in the provision was considered in isolation, without regard to the qualifying words or, if the qualifying words were not present in the provision, which cannot be done and which they are not.75 It should be pointed out that notwithstanding use of the definite article in the last phrase it does not necessarily mean literally that the relevant “government” actually exists. It may mean that it “purports” to be issued by a government, real or not. The two situations, ie “purported” issue by a real, or a fictitious, government of a foreign country may be covered by the provision. Thus can be seen some ambiguity giving the words “the government of a foreign country” their ordinary or literal meaning in isolation. 76 Although the respondent’s construction is said to be supported by the legislative context of its relationship to s.9B Passports Act, as discussed in the Crown’s submissions, this example begs the ultimate question. There is no anomaly if the relevant phrase, “the government of a foreign country”, in ss.9A(1)(f)(ii) and 9B(b) are given the same meaning. Although nothing in s.5(4) of the Act, in my view, contradicts the construction contended by the respondent, in reality that definition or interpretation is a neutral matter in the debate. It is concerned with the definition of “passport” not the issue of whether is the relevant “government etc” is real of fictional. The explanatory note to the Bill and the terms of the Second reading speech at the time of the introduction of the provision support either construction contended. They certainly do not resolve any ambiguity. The reference to Clause 12 (now s.9A) in the speech is itself ambiguous in meaning. The reference to “fabrications” in context may be either a reference to the fabrication of “passports” supposedly issued by real countries or to ‘fabrications’ of documents merely to look like “Passports”. In Brear v James Hardie (2000) 50 NSWLR 388 (at 397) Mason P. noted the ‘restraint’ required in construing on enactment as regards the intended effect of it in light of a Minister’s speech. Subsequent legislation does not in my view inform the construction of the provision.77 As to any purposive construction, clearly the provisions are designed to prevent access to the possession of forged, altered or fabricated documents being passed off as ‘real’ passports. The fact that a “country” is identified in a relevant document by a name, formerly used for a real “country”, nation or territory, may lend aid to the assertion that the “document” in question ”purports” to be a passport issued by the government of a foreign country, but that matter is an issue of fact to be resolved on the evidence.78 In The Queen v Lavender (2005) 79 ALJR 1337 (at 1345) the majority emphasised the importance of “context” resolving questions of statutory construction. The context here is not just the context of the relevant provision, but also the context of related provisions and those provisions considered in the context of the Act itself (Lavender at 1345-1346). The relevant provision must be considered in the context of related or connected provisions such as ss.9A(1)(f)(i) and 9B(b), where the expression “the government of the foreign country” appears and the wider context of these provisions, particularly other provisions in s.9A(1).79 On the other hand the relevant provision seen in the context of the entire subparagraph or in context of the other provisions in the Section supports the appellant’s contention as to what he categorised as the literal meaning of the previsions. The other subparagraphs of s.9A(1) are concerned with offences relevant to possession and use of Australian passports. S.9A(1)(f) is the only one concerned with passports or documents from, or purported to be from places external to the Commonwealth of Australia. In this context the words “issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign government” ought have a meaning consistent with those words appearing in s.9A(1)(f)(i) and elsewhere. Looked at this way the relevant words in the provision may have the meaning contended for by the appellant, that is a concern about a real, not a fictitious, government of a foreign government (Avondale Motors (Ports) Pty Ltd v FCT (1971) 45 ALJR 280 – at 283). In the context of what is provided for in s.9A(1)(e) (concerned with falsified or purported Australian passports), where the offences created are concerned with “falsifying” (s.9A(1)(e)(i)) or “fabricating” (s.9A(1)(e)(ii)) a passport or document coming from or purporting to be from the same source, a consistent meaning for the source or purported source of a foreign government that issued passport makes sense. It does not lead to absurd consequences.80 This construction is consistent with the purpose of the legislation, to make unlawful the use and possession of falsified or fabricated passports or documents. This is also consistent with the expressions of purpose and objective of the proposed legislation having regard to the Act as a whole or the second reading speech(es) of the Minister(s).81 Subparagraphs (e) and (f) seen together with their respective sub subparagraphs (ii) compared to (i) invite a consistency of approach, as the ‘literal’ interpretation suggests.82 Contrary to the submissions of the respondent this construction does not create any anomaly with the terms of s.9B. That provision may likewise be concerned with a consistent circumstance, prohibiting the “fabrication” of real passports, not those of non existent governments of foreign countries at the time of making the document. Consistency of meaning to common terms in both provisions does not lead to absurd outcomes or outcomes inconsistent, necessarily, with the purpose of the legislation.83 The ‘supposed temporal connection’ issue raised by the prosecution is not a matter that informs the proper construction or for that matter or will lead to absurd outcomes as suggested by the prosecution. The offence is committed on the date (or between the dates) particularised in the charge. Contrary to the submission of the Crown the relevant time for considering when the document “purports” to be a “passport” must be at the time of possession. The application of the provision is dependant on establishing possession which must, of necessity be fixed in time. The date of claimed issue as well as the appearance of the document are factual issues relevant to determining whether the offence is made out. Whether the offence is made out is not determined by establishing the relevant facts and then relating those facts back to situations at the date of the enactment or immediately thereafter. The relationship of the purport of the document to the relevant dates(s) and the identity of the purported “government” is an issue of fact, relevant to whether the document purports to be what is required to be proved. If the government of a foreign country no longer exists in the name of ‘the country’ on ‘the document’ at the time of possession, then that may be relevant to the issue of whether the charge is proved, but only if the relevant ‘government’ had existed at the time of claimed issue of the document or the circumstances of the possession bore a realistic relationship to establishing that the document relevantly purported to be what was to be proved. Illustrations of name changes of nations or governments of foreign country(ies) between date of issue of the document and the date of possession are not to point in this matter. The ‘entity’, or ‘territory’, or ‘country’ “New Hebrides” ceased to exist in 1980, 17 years before the relevant ‘document’ was “purportedly” issued. The illustration of events post passage of s.9A and pre-independence for Vanuatu has no salience in this matter given the facts. The supposed ‘absurd’ consequences are hypothetical not real.84 Thus the provision seen in context, endeavouring to give relevant words their literal or normal meaning, with no patently absurd consequence, may have two competing meanings creating doubt or ambiguity. This brings the matter back to the observations in Beckwith, Murphy v Farmer and elsewhere, that when the meaning of the penal statute, when subjected to the ordinary rules of construction, remains doubtful or ambiguous, the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject, by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences. This is such a situation given the competing issues raised. On balance, considering the normal meaning of the words in context the position is either evenly balanced (as discussed in Murphy) or slightly in favour of the appellant’s contention as to the meaning of the provision particularly when seen in context. Notwithstanding the hallmarks of a “passport” represented in the document, the document did not relevantly purport to be a passport issued by the government of a foreign country.Constitutional Implications85 Having regard to the above conclusions there is no need to fully consider the constitutional issue, except to point out that on the appellants contention, neither construction submitted had constitutional authority for the Parliament to legislate. I will shortly deal with the issue as it is clear that neither contention was within the authority of the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate.86 Taking the approach advised by the Bank of New South Wales case, once the provision is construed, one must determine the subject matter in which it is contended the Commonwealth had power to make laws. Here the relevant power to consider, as agreed by the parties, is the “external affairs” power.87 Further, as a law of the Commonwealth it is to be construed in terms of s.15A Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That states: 
     
      
      “Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being an excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power”. 
      
    88 As to the issue of the relevant power of the Parliament to make laws “for the order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to external affairs”, (s.51 xxix Constitution Act), such laws amongst other things may relate to the relations between Australia and other countries (Zines at 292).89 The power extends to matters external to Australia in which Australia has an interest. It has been very widely construed in Koowarta v Bjelke Peterson (1982) 153 CLR 168, where Gibbs J. in a different context observed (at 201) 
     
      
      “A law which regulates transactions between Australia and other countries, or between residents of Australia and residents of other countries, would be a law with respect to external affairs, whatever its subject matter”. 
      
    90 In Sharkey (cited by the appellant) a charge of exciting 
     
      
      “disaffection against the Government … of any of the King’s Dominions” was held to be valid under the external affairs powers, principally because “relations” between Australia and other countries outside Australia fell within the external affairs power, including maintaining “friendly relations” (Latham CJ – at 136-7, McTiernan J at 157, Dixon J – at 149, Webb J – at 163). 
      
    91 In Polyukhovich v Commonwealth (the “War Crimes Case”) (1991) 172 CLR 501 the High Court held that a law that operated upon conduct which took place outside Australia and made that conduct a criminal offence in Australia was a law with respect to external affairs within s.51(xxxix) of the Constitution.92 Mason CJ said: 
     
      
      “Discussion of the scope of the external affairs power has naturally concentrated upon its operation in the context of Australia’s relationships with other countries and the implementation of Australia’s treaty obligations. However, it is clear that the scope of the power is not confined to these matters and that it extends to matters external to Australia. I have previously expressed the view that the grant of legislative power with respect to external affairs should be construed with all the generality that the words meant and that, so construed, the power extends to matters and things, as well as relationships outside Australia …. the power extended to persons, as well as matters and things outside Australia.” (at 528). 
      
    93 Justice Dawson, also part of the majority, in Polyukhovich observed: 
     
      
      “Whilst I have never been able to accept the view that the external affairs power … extends to matters of a purely domestic character merely because they form the subject of an international treaty or may otherwise be shown to be of international concern, I have never doubted that the power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word affairs is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word “external” is precise and unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase “external affairs”  
      (at 632) 
      . 
      
    94 In Polyukhovich the High Court did hold that the provision in the War Crimes Act was within the external affairs power because it did not relate to conduct within Australia. The offences set out in s.9A(1)(f) include conduct within Australia. That does not mean however that this offence, concerned with offences committed within Australia, must thus be outside the scope of the legislation. The majority each pointed out that they did not have to decide whether the operation of treaties and other international obligations operated to make domestic acts, related to an “external affair”, within power.95 In the Franklin Dam Case (1983) 158 CLR 1, Gibbs CJ said:  
     
      
      “If a matter can properly be said to relate to other nations or to things external to Australia, the Parliament may pass laws with respect to it, even if not regulated by international agreement”  
      (at 190) 
      . 
      
    96 Given the scope of the external affairs power, whether or not it is correct to state that the “law of passports” is a matter of municipal regulation, it is not accurate to categorise the issue of documents purporting to be issued by the government for a foreign country as not raising any matter external to Australia even if the prohibited conduct is within Australia. The issue of such “documents” permits travel to and from Australia and over Australia, irrespective of whether a visa duly entered on the document permits entry to a particular country. Australia’s relations with other countries, nations or government are concerned with, amongst other things, the integrity and validity of documents used for international travel. In an era of transnational, fraud, terrorism and other crimes the capacity of Australia to monitor and regulate the conduct of foreign nationals and/or its relations with governments of foreign countries is very much determined by the capacity of Australia to maintain and determine the integrity of documents issued by the governments of foreign countries or purporting to so do so. A clever fabrication of a “real passport”, to the untrained eye, is just as much a threat to the security of Australia, and for the security of other countries with whom Australia has relations, as a genuine document altered or forged.97 The prosecution in greater detail pointed out many reasons for the Australian Government to have a concern to legislate in relation to matters categorised as domestic conduct that related to “external affairs” power, some of which are referred to above.98 In relation to the issue of the relevance of the issue of passports to the external affairs power, reference was made to the discussion about the external affairs power in “Commentaries on the Constitution Powers of the Parliament” and it’s treatment of the topic. I was also referred to a document edited by Patrick Brazil, published by the Australian Government Publishing service (in 1981) entitled “Opinions of Attorney Generals of the Commonwealth of Australia”, particularly to opinions expressed in 1906 as to the status of New Hebrides at that time and the Commonwealth’s power to issue passports visa vie the external affairs power.99 The opinion of the Attorney General in 1906 was that the New Hebrides was not a “foreign country”, “nation” or “state”, in the sense that those words were used in treaties to prefer “favoured nations” status to certain foreign countries by which the Commonwealth was bound, most of which were treaties signed before the establishment of the Commonwealth. That opinion however, does not assist in relation to this matter given the context in which it was expressed. 100 The opinion of the Attorney General in relation to the power of the Commonwealth to regulate the issue of passports, was concerned with the question, that arose during World War 1, as to whether, after the War, the States may resume the issue of passports. The Attorney General, William Morris Hughes, was of the opinion that a passport is in substance “a document, issued by government for identifying a citizen and authenticating his right to protection when in a foreign country”. More relevantly, he was of the opinion that the issue of passports clearly came within the scope of “external affairs” and that the Commonwealth Parliament should legislate to regulate the issue of passports to overcome the “undesirable” situation of the States issuing passports. Of course, the Commonwealth of Australia’s interest in regulating the possession and usage of falsified or fabricated passports issued by other countries, within the Commonwealth of Australia, could not be in doubt. The Commonwealth, at least, has an interest in it’s relationship with countries, nations and territories outside of Australia, in ensuring that such documents are prevented from future use, or circulation, outside of the “issuing” country, when that issue arises from conduct within Australia.101 As to the issue of whether the regulation of passports is a matter of “municipal concern”, or of “municipal law”, I am not satisfied on the basis of the Melbourne University Law Review article to which I was referred, “The Evolution of Australian Passport Law”, that the circumstances attaching to the prohibition upon the possession of fabricated passports, or documents purporting to be passports, is outside the scope of “external affairs power” simply because the author “suggests” that the prescribing of the kind of identity documents, which the Commonwealth requires the traveller to have in his possession, is solely a matter of “municipal law” and thus falls outside the scope of the external affairs power.102 This proposition is based upon the statement that a passport “is a document of identity, which a state may require alien travellers within its territories to have in their possession”. This is not the sole purpose of a passport and in any event the Commonwealth’s interest in purported passports issued outside the Commonwealth of Australia is not limited to matters of identity per se, but includes an interest preventing the use of fabricated documents to aid the commission of transnational crime or risks to the security of the Commonwealth of Australia and foreign countries by assisting movement between countries.103 There is no suggestion in the appellant’s submissions that the Commonwealth does not have power to make laws as to the regulation of passports in the various ways contemplated in other provisions of the Passports Act 1938 or particularly passports not issued in Australia. The terms of s.4A are not claimed to be “ultra vires”. The scope of the legislation is made clear by the operation of s.4A of the Act. There can be no doubt in my view that the Commonwealth has power to regulate and prohibit the use and possession of documents which “purport” to be passports, whether the government on the document exists or not as a fact. It is the “purport” of the document as “a passport” which the law regulates and prohibits. The origins of the document, its actual appearance and the particulars of the document (so long as the document holds itself out to be a passport) are irrelevant to the issue as to whether the relevant legislative provision has been passed without power.104 In any event, there is an express incidental power (s51 (xxxix) of the Constitution Act) and an implied incidental power arising under each head of power in s.51 of the Constitution Act. The implied power exists, or the relevant connection with a head of power exists, if the impugned law has a “real connection” to the constitutional subject matter. It does not matter what “test” is applied (eg Leask v Commonwealth (1996) 140 ALR 1 per Kirby J – (at 40), Grannall v Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd (1955) 93 CLR 55, (at 77) or D’Emdem v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 (at 109)), to define the scope or nature of an implied power, or incidental power. The power to make laws relating to the prohibition of the possession, or use, of documents purporting to be passports, however fabricated for that purpose, can be clearly seen, at least, as, incidental to the external affairs power. Here any incidental power that arises is that needed to protect the efficacy of the execution by the Executive Government of its powers and capacities, including the exercise of the external affairs power to regulate and protect Australia’s borders and security.Conclusion105 The Appeal is upheld.106 The finding of guilt and consequent orders are set aside and quashed.

     REGINA v Josephine NGATIKAURA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Headnote 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      The respondent was charged with one count of “ 
      supply heroin 
      ” contrary to s.25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW)  
      1985. The offence charged involved a deemed supply. A police search of the respondent’s home uncovered a quantity (5.74 grams) of heroin along with other drug paraphernalia. The respondent pleaded not guilty. The respondent’s husband, who is being tried separately with the same offence, also occupied the house. The anticipated defence of the respondent is that the drugs were in her husband’s exclusive possession and that their presence within the home was not within her knowledge. 
       
       
      The Crown sought to adduce evidence of two prior offences of “ 
      supply heroin 
      ”, to which she had pleaded guilty. These offences were committed at a different address, the packaging of the drugs was different, and each involved an actual supply to an undercover agent as opposed to deemed supply. 
       
       
      The Crown sought to adduce evidence of the two prior offences in order to: (i) demonstrate that the accused was a drug dealer by occupation; and (ii) rebut the respondent’s likely defence of her innocent association with the drugs. 
       
       
      The trial judge held that the evidence was admissible but nonetheless rejected it on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. In making the ruling his Honour referred to the “ 
      balancing exercise 
      ” spoken of in  
      Harriman v The Queen  
      (1989) 167 CLR 590. 
       
       
      The Crown appealed against the ruling on the grounds that: (i) the trial judge made no finding that there was or would be any prejudicial effect if the evidence was admitted or that there was a risk that the evidence would be used by the jury in some unfair way; and (ii) the trial judge gave no consideration to the possibility that a direction could be given to the jury to guard against misuse of the evidence.  
       
       
      During the hearing of the appeal a further matter arose as to whether the evidence of the prior offences ought to be properly characterised as tendency evidence pursuant to the  
      Evidence Act (NSW)  
      1995 (the  
      Evidence Act 
      ): ss.97(1) and 101(2). Neither the appellant nor the respondent had submitted to the trial judge that the evidence was tendency evidence. Both had accepted that the evidence was admissible subject only to its exclusion under s.135 or s.137. 
       
       
      HELD: 
       
      Per Beazley JA (Simpson and Rothman JJ agreeing) 
       
      (i) This court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the decision of the trial judge to exclude the evidence “substantially weaken[ed] the prosecution’s case” as required by s.5F(3A) of the  
      Criminal Appeals Act 1912  
      (NSW). Evidence of the prior offences would diminish the plausibility of an innocent association with the drugs:  
      R v Filipetti  
      (1978) 13 A Crim R 335 (followed);  
      Steffan v R 
       (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 (not applied). 
       
       
      (ii) Section 5F(3A) permits an appeal by the Crown against an interlocutory ruling, regardless of whether or not a jury has been empanelled:  
      R v Milakovic 
       [2004] NSWCCA 199 (distinguished). 
       
       
      Per Simpson J (Rothman J agreeing; Beazley JA dissenting) 
       
      (iv) The evidence of the prior offences was tendency evidence and its admissibility was thus governed by ss.97(1) and 101(2) of the  
      Evidence Act  
      (the tendency provisions):  
      R v Fletcher  
      [2005] NSWCCA 338 (discussed). 
       
       
      (v) There is no room beyond the operation of the tendency provisions for the application of either s.135 or s.137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       to tendency evidence. 
       
       
      (vi) As the trial judge did not consider whether the evidence should be admitted under s.97, nor whether s.101(2) should operate to exclude the evidence, the matter should be remitted to the District Court for reconsideration. 
       
       
      Observations of Rothman J 
       
      (vii) Common law principles from pre- 
      Evidence Act  
      judgments may be used, with care, as a guide in evaluating admissibility of evidence under the  
      Evidence Act 
      . The provisions of s.97 largely reflect statements made by the High Court in  
      Pfennig 
      , namely that for admissibility the evidence must show more than a disposition to commit the crime:  
      Pfennig v The Queen  
      (1995) 182 CLR 461 (discussed). 
       
       
      (viii) The exception in s.97 where evidence has significant probative value is the equivalent of the common law principle allowing evidence that goes to the probability of the very offence before the Court. 
       
       
      (ix) The trial judge was correct to reject the evidence on the basis proffered by the Crown, as the Crown had not relied on the evidence as tendency evidence. It would be open to the Crown to seek to tender the material again on a different basis. In these circumstances the appeal ought ordinarily be dismissed, but given the reasons of Simpson J the orders proposed by her should be made. 
       
       
      Per Beazley JA (dissenting) 
       
      (x) The evidence was not tendency evidence. The use to which evidence of the prior offences was to be put was to prove the respondent was a drug dealer and that her association with the drugs was not innocent. This is a purpose other than a tendency purpose, and as such the evidence is not governed by the tendency provisions:  
      R v Quach 
       (2002) 137 A Crim R 345;  
      Harriman v The Queen  
      (1989) 167 CLR 590 (followed). 
       
       
      (xi) The trial judge made a bare finding that the evidence was to be excluded because the probative force of the proposed evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This is not a finding in the terms of either s.135 or s.137, and it is not possible to determine whether the trial judge applied a correct test. His Honour did not specify what the unfair prejudice was and why it outweighed the probative value of the evidence. His reasons were thus inadequate. For either of these reasons the trial judge erred in law:  
      R v Harker 
        
      [2004] NSWCCA 427;  
      R v Blick 
       (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; [2000] NSWCCA 61;

      (xii) The trial judge failed to consider, in assessing whether the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by any unfair prejudice, whether an appropriate direction could have been given to the jury to guard against misuse. His Honour’s assessment thereby miscarried:

      (xiii) Pursuant to s.5F(5) of the

      (xiv) Evidence of the respondent’s active involvement in selling heroin has significant probative value as it could rationally affect the assessment of whether she was aware of the presence of drugs in her home. The prejudice to the defendant is not unfair and does not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. The evidence accordingly should not be rejected under s.135 or s.137:

     REGINA v Josephine NGATIKAURA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The respondent is presently charged with one count of “supply of … a prohibited drug”, namely heroin, contrary to s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW) 1985. This appeal is from a ruling by Maguire DCJ made on 29 November 2005 that evidence of the respondent’s commission of two other offences of “supply heroin” contrary to s.25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, to which she has pleaded guilty, should not be admitted in evidence in her trial. 
     
      
    2 The heroin, amounting to 5.74 grams, the subject of the present charge, was found following a police search on 3 November 2004 of the home the respondent shares with her husband and children. The drugs were contained within 41 multi-coloured water balloons along with a sum of cash in the amount of $335.00 and were found in a pink child’s bag hidden underneath couch cushions in the lounge room. The respondent maintained that she had no knowledge of either the existence or contents of the pink child’s bag, although she told police that she believed her husband was dealing in drugs.  
     
      
    3 The police search also uncovered in the children’s bedroom two rolls of cash in the sum of $5,150.00 and seven bags of multi-coloured balloons of the kind used to package prohibited drugs. A black bag containing foil, balloons, a plastic box and scales was found in the kitchen cupboard. The respondent initially denied knowledge of the black bag, but later admitted to police that she had put it in the kitchen cupboard because she was scared the police would arrest her husband.  
     
      
    4 The respondent has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The respondent’s husband is being tried separately for the same offence.  
     
      
    5 The Crown is seeking to adduce evidence of the two earlier offences and the pleas of guilty to them. The first offence involved a supply of heroin on 28 September 2004, when the respondent sold an undercover police operative two small foil packages each containing 0.29 grams of compressed heroin. The second involved a supply on 20 October 2004 of one small gold foil package containing 0.15 grams of compressed heroin to another undercover police operative. Both offences took place at the same address, which is not the respondent’s home.6 The Crown seeks to adduce evidence of the earlier offences (i) to demonstrate that the accused was a drug dealer by occupation; and (ii) to rebut the respondent’s likely defence, as revealed in her record of interview, of her innocent association with the drugs found at her home. 
     
      
    7 The trial judge held that the evidence was admissible but nonetheless rejected it on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. In making the ruling his Honour referred to the “balancing exercise” spoken of in Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590; [1989] HCA 50. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    8 The Crown appeals against the ruling on two bases. First, the Crown claims that the trial judge made no finding that there was or would be any prejudicial effect if the evidence was admitted or that there was a risk that the evidence would be used by the jury in some unfair way: see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [91]; [1997] HCA 37. Secondly, the Crown claims that the trial judge gave no consideration to the possibility that a direction could be given to the jury to guard against misuse of the evidence.  
     
      
    9 The Crown appeal has been brought pursuant to the provisions of s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) 1912 (the Criminal Appeal Act). That section provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence,  
        but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    10 It appears that before the trial judge both the Crown and counsel for the defence accepted that the evidence was admissible and that the question for the Court’s consideration was whether, as a matter of discretion, the evidence should be excluded.  
     
      
    11 A court may exclude evidence pursuant to ss.135 and 137 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995 (the Evidence Act). Those sections provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “135 General discretion to exclude evidence  
        
       
       
        
        The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, … 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        137  
        Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
        
       
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”  
        
       
      
    12 In rejecting the evidence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        It seems to me that the evidence proposed to be advanced by the Crown is admissible. It comes down to a question of the sort of balancing exercise that Brennan J speaks of in Harriman. 
        
       
       
        
        Doing the best I can, I think that the  
        probative force of the proposed evidence is outweighed by the prejudicial effect that it would have 
        , and I reject the evidence.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    13 This finding more closely resembles the wording of s.137 than s.135. However, it is not a finding in the terms of either section. I will return to this later. 
     
      
    14 Before I deal with the Crown’s contentions, it is necessary to refer to a matter that arose during the hearing of the appeal, namely, whether the evidence of the prior offences is tendency evidence. If it is tendency evidence, its admissibility is governed by Pt.3.6 of the Evidence Act. This is important for the following reasons. First, if the evidence is tendency evidence, notice in writing of the intention to adduce the evidence must be given: s.97(1)(a). In this case, no notice has been given although the Court may dispense with the notice requirement: s.100. Secondly, and more significantly, tendency evidence is not admissible unless it has significant probative value: s.97(1)(b). Further, in a criminal proceeding tendency evidence adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value “substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”: s.101(2). If the evidence is not tendency evidence and is otherwise admissible, the evidence is subject to being excluded under ss.135-137.  
     
      
      Is the evidence of the prior offences tendency evidence? 
        
       
      
    15 ""Tendency evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “… evidence of a kind referred to in section 97 (1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” 
        
       
      
    16 Section 97(1) provides, relevantly:  
     
      
       
        
        “97 The tendency rule 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had,  
        is not admissible 
         to prove that a person  
        has or had a tendency 
         (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have  
          significant probative value 
          .” (emphases added)  
          
         
        
       
      
    17 In the case of criminal proceedings, the provisions of s.101 impose a further restriction on the use of tendency evidence as mentioned above. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution  
        cannot be used against the defendant 
          
        unless 
         the probative value of the evidence  
        substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect 
         it may have on the defendant”. (emphases added) 
        
       
      
    18 If the evidence is properly characterised as tendency evidence, then it must be dealt with pursuant to ss.97(1) and 101(2). However, evidence which on its face may be tendency evidence, may still be admissible and/or used without regard to those sections if it is used for some other purpose. This was discussed in R v Quach (2002) 137 A Crim R 345; [2002] NSWCCA 519. In that case, the Court was concerned with the admissibility of intercepted telephone conversations between the accused and a third person. The essential issue in the Crown case was whether there had been a supply of heroin at the accused’s residence on a particular date. The Crown case was circumstantial. The intercepted telephone conversations established that the accused and another person involved in the supply had had extensive telephone contact over the weeks preceding the particular occasion of supply with which the accused was charged. The content of the telephone conversations also established that the telephone contact between the accused and the other person related to drugs.19 Spigelman CJ at [14] observed that the frequency and nature of the telephone contacts were of direct relevance, notwithstanding that they contained admissions as to participation in other drug dealings which were prejudicial. His Honour considered that the admissibility of the telephone conversations was justified on two bases. The first was on a narrow basis that a telephone conversation a few days prior to the occasion of supply with which the accused was charged referred to a drug supply about to occur and that earlier conversations established the nature and content of that later conversation. The second basis was a broader one based upon the principles established in Harriman. It is this broader basis with which I am presently concerned.  
     
      
    20 Harriman was a pre-Evidence Act decision.  It had been argued in Quach that the evidence admitted in Harriman had been admitted on a tendency basis such that, if it was being considered under the Evidence Act it would be governed by the provisions of ss.97 and 101. The Court rejected that submission. Spigelman CJ, at [24], considered that the reasoning in Harriman was “consistent with the admissibility of evidence of prior heroin dealings on a basis other than tendency reasoning”.  
     
      
    21 In Harriman, Brennan J dealt, at 593, with the question whether evidence that an accused had committed other offences of the same or similar character was admissible. His Honour noted (at 593-594) that such evidence was inadmissible unless its probative force ""clearly transcends the merely prejudicial effect of showing that the accused has committed other offences”. His Honour (at 594) distinguished between a tendency purpose (which, under the Evidence Act would require the court to apply the provisions of ss.97(1) and 101(2)) and other uses. 
     
      
       
        
        “… where evidence does show more than the mere commission of another offence or predisposition to commit an offence and is otherwise probative of the offence charged or of a fact in issue, there is no rule of evidence which compels its exclusion. If, as a matter of human experience, the evidence tends to establish the offence charged or a fact in issue otherwise than by showing merely the commission of another offence or a propensity to commit an offence, the evidence is admissible.” 
        
       
      
    22 Brennan J continued, at 595 (with particular reference to the offence involved in that case): 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of prior involvement by Harriman and [a third person] in the sale of heroin in association, evidence … of prior sales of heroin by Harriman and evidence of Harriman's use of heroin were clearly prejudicial and were not admissible unless something more than the commission of prior offences was thereby revealed.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour concluded that in that case something more was revealed. He said (at 596):  
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of Harriman's participation in the heroin trade not only strengthened the Crown allegation of motive; it tended to make it more likely that Harriman's relevant contacts with [the third person] …. were for a guilty rather than an innocent purpose: see Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234. That evidence was highly probative of the offences charged. It was admissible, whether or not Harriman had raised in cross-examination the ""defence"" that [the third person] was acting alone. There was no ground for excluding it in the exercise of a discretion.” 
        
       
      
    24 In Quach, Spigelman CJ, after referring to these passages, specifically addressed the question whether the use to which Brennan J had held that the prior drug dealings could be put was within the formulation of the ""tendency rule"" in s.97. His Honour (at [32]) pointed out that the focus in s.97 ""is on the purpose of the tender. Section 97 is irrelevant where evidence is admitted for a purpose other than to show tendency” (emphasis added). The Chief Justice continued (at [33]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Brennan J's reasoning uses the language of the common law in distinguishing ""predisposition"" from evidence ""otherwise probative"" of the offence. The same kind of distinction exists under the Evidence Act between evidence ‘to prove… a tendency’ and evidence ‘to prove’, relevantly, whether [the other person involved in the transaction] entered the respondent's house and/or the character of the transaction that occurred on that occasion.” 
        
       
      
    25 In this case, the Crown seeks to adduce the evidence of the prior offences so as to prove the respondent was a drug dealer and that her association with the drugs in her home was not innocent. In my opinion, given the purpose for which the evidence is proposed to be used, it is not tendency evidence within s.97. Given that conclusion it is not necessary in this appeal to consider whether, if evidence is tendency evidence and thereby subject relevantly to ss.97 and 101, ss.135-137 have any or any additional operation: see R v WRC (2002) 130 A Crim R 89; [2002] NSWCCA 210. It is convenient to now turn to the specific grounds of appeal raised by the Crown. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: no finding as to prejudicial effect  
       
      
    26 It appears that his Honour rejected the evidence under the provisions of s.137, although, as I have indicated it is not clear whether that was so. But in any event, his Honour made no more than a bare finding that the probative force of the proposed evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The Crown complained that in making a finding in these bare terms his Honour failed to find that there would be such prejudicial effect, and he further failed to find that there was a risk that the evidence would be used by the jury in some unfair way.  
     
      
    27 In R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 Howie J at [47], (in an obiter remark), after observing that the trial judge in that case had simply concluded that evidence would be rejected under s.137 without explaining why it was unfairly prejudicial and without giving an appropriate direction to the jury as to the use of the evidence, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “… adequate reasons for the rejection of evidence will hardly be found in a simple statement that s.137 applies or in a bare finding that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence. The reasons for judgment must make clear what the unfair prejudice is and why it is of such a kind that the evidence must be rejected despite its probative value.""  
        
       
      
    28 In R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; [2000] NSWCCA 61, Sheller JA (at [19]-[20]) commented upon the task that a judge was required to undertake when considering whether evidence must be excluded pursuant to s.137. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s.137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion... Even so... there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected.""  
        
       
      
    29 In R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, Simpson J (Ipp JA and Adams J agreeing) observed (at [38]) that the balancing exercise involved the exercise of ""judgment"" rather than the exercise of a “discretion"".  
     
      
    30 In this case, the only assistance one gets from his Honour's remarks as to the considerations he took into account is his reference to Harriman, and more specifically his reference to ""the balancing exercise"" referred to by Brennan J in that case. However, his Honour did not specify what the unfair prejudice was and why it was of such a kind that the evidence must be rejected despite its probative value: see R v Harker at [47]; see also R v Cook at [37]. In these circumstances, it is not possible to know whether his Honour considered the evidence had little probative value or whether, even if its probative value was high, the unfair prejudice to the defendant outweighed its probative value. 
     
      
    31 Further and perhaps more importantly are the terms in which the trial judge made his finding. I have referred to that at [13]. His Honour’s finding is not made in terms of either s.135 or s.137. The failure to make a finding in the precise terms of the section cannot, in my view, be treated as accidental or unimportant, or due to a lack of precision that sometimes understandably is found in the language of extempore judgments. The tests in s.135 and s.137 are different from each other (although that will not always be important: see [44] below). The more fundamental problem with his Honour’s ruling is that neither section involves a balancing exercise between “probative value” and “prejudicial effect”. It follows, in my opinion, that the trial judge either applied the wrong test, or because of the inadequacy of his reasons it is uncertain what test he did apply. In either event, his Honour erred in law.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: failure to give consideration to a jury direction 
      
    32 A court is required, as part of the assessment of the question whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by any unfair prejudice, to consider whether an appropriate direction can be given to the jury to ensure that the evidence is not misused in any way: see R v Cook at [37]. His Honour did not give any express consideration to that question. The possibility that a direction may be given to the jury is integral to the assessment a trial judge must otherwise make in determining whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the unfair prejudice. Failure to give consideration to that question means that his Honour’s consideration whether s.137 should (assuming that was his Honour’s ruling) be applied so as to exclude the evidence of the prior offences, miscarried. 
     
      
       
      Consequence of establishing error 
       
      
    33 As the Crown has established error it is open to this Court to assess for itself whether or not the evidence must be rejected under s.137: see s.5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is no reason why this Court should not do so. All the material facts are before the Court and there are no questions of credit involved. 
     
      
       
      Should the evidence be rejected? 
       
      
    34 Section 135 provides that the Court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party.  
     
      
    35 Section 137 provides that the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
     
      
    36 “Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Probative value 
         of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.”  
        
       
        
      
    37 In Papakosmas v The Queen, McHugh J, said at [91]: “[e]vidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted"". His Honour also endorsed the remark of Hunt CJ at CL in R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prejudice to which each of the sections [ss. 135, 136 and 137] refers is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means the prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way."" 
        
       
      
    38 The application of s.137 was further considered in R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182; [2002] NSWCCA 509, where Wood CJ at CL said at [116]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As is now well established, the prejudice to the defendant of which each of s.135 and s.137 speak is not the simple fact that the evidence may advance the Crown case or weaken the defence case. Rather it means damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves.""  
        
       
      
    39 His Honour further pointed out, at [117], that there must be more than a hypothetical risk of it being unfairly prejudicial in this way. The risk must be a real one: see also R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 at 324; [2001] NSWCCA 413. 
     
      
    40 In this case, the Crown seeks to rely upon the evidence of the prior offences to establish that the respondent is a drug dealer such that she could not have, realistically, an innocent explanation for the presence of the drugs, money and equipment in her home. It is apparent from the respondent’s denial of any knowledge of the presence of these items that the central issue at trial will be whether the respondent knew of the existence of the drugs in her home. If she was actively involved in selling heroin, the presence of substantial quantities of drugs, money and equipment associated with the supply of drugs in her home was likely to be known to her. Accordingly, the evidence of her involvement in selling heroin, as proved by evidence of the prior two offences, could rationally affect the assessment of whether she was aware of the presence of the drugs in her home, this being a case of deemed supply.  
     
      
    41 The respondent does not contest this. Rather, she submitted that the probative value of the evidence was not high. She relies upon the fact that there was a separation in time between the earlier supplies (which occurred on the 28 September and 20 October 2004 respectively) and the offence with which she was charged, which occurred on 3 November 2004. She further relies upon the fact that the earlier supplies occurred at a different address, that the packaging of the earlier supplies was different from the way the heroin found in her home was packaged (namely in balloons rather than wrapped in foil), and that as there was no analysis of the purity of the drugs involved in the earlier supply, a comparison could not be made with the purity of the drugs found at her home. A further distinction was that the evidence sought to be tendered was of actual supply whereas this case involved a “deemed supply”. 
     
      
    42 It was submitted that when these matters were taken into account, it was apparent that they did not constitute evidence of substantial participation in the heroin trade so as to support an inference of continued participation and there was no real proximate connection with the offence with which she is presently charged. On the other hand, it was likely that the prejudicial effect of the prior offences would be high.43 In my opinion, the time gap between the previous two offences and this offence is significant. It reveals gaps of approximately three weeks between each of the two offences and the present charge. The evidence of the first two offences thus demonstrates that at a time proximate to the offence with which the respondent is presently charged, she engaged in drug dealing. The difference in the “wrapping” of the drug does tend to diminish the probative value of the prior two offences. However, the fact that the drug on each of the three occasions was heroin is more significant in assessing the probative value of the evidence than is the different wrapping. I do not consider that the fact that there was no testing of the purity of the drug on the prior occasions is of much relevance in assessing the probative value of this evidence. It is not part of the Crown case, as I understand it, that the drug came from the same source. Nor do I consider it important that the present charge involves a “deemed” rather than an actual supply. Drugs have to be obtained and stored somewhere before they are on-sold. 
     
      
    44 It follows from the foregoing that the evidence of the two prior charges does have significant probative value. The question for this Court then is whether the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of being unfairly prejudicial (s.135) or is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s.137) to the respondent. In this case, if the test in s.137 is satisfied, it would follow that s.135 would also be satisfied, because the Court would already have determined that the unfair prejudice to the respondent outweighed the probative value of the evidence. It would not then be necessary to determine whether the evidence also substantially outweighed the probative value. Accordingly, this being a criminal trial and s.137 requiring the exclusion of evidence if satisfied, it is sufficient, in my opinion to determine the matter under that section.  
     
      
    45 There is no doubt that the evidence of the prior offences would be prejudicial. The question is whether it would be unfairly so. On the assumption that the evidence is not excluded, it will still be open to the respondent to rely upon the matters she raised in this Court as being reasons why, notwithstanding the prior two offences, she had no knowledge of or connection with the drugs the subject of the present charge. Those will be matters for the jury to assess in determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It cannot be said, in my opinion, that it is likely that the jury will use that information irrationally or illogically or emotionally as discussed by Wood CJ at CL in R v Suteski. It will still be necessary for the jury to assess whether the respondent in fact knew of the presence of the drugs in her home. The differences adverted to at [41] may be relevant to this assessment. But in any event, it will still be open to a jury to find that the respondent did not know of the presence of the drugs on her premises despite the evidence that she was involved in selling heroin in different circumstances.  
     
      
    46 It follows, in my opinion, that the prejudice to the defendant is not unfair and does not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. It will be open to a trial judge to give an appropriate direction as to the use to which the evidence may be put, depending upon the manner in which the respondent decides to conduct her defence.  
     
      
    47 For these reasons I would allow the appeal. Before concluding that that is the order that should be made, it is necessary to refer to two arguments advanced on behalf of the respondent as to why the appeal should not be allowed. 
     
      
    48 The first was said to be a jurisdictional question. It was submitted that the ruling complained of was a ruling on the admissibility of evidence and therefore not an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" for the purposes of s.5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act: Steffan v R (1993) 30 NSWLR 633. In that case, the Court (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Sharpe JJ) said, at 639, that a ruling on the evidence made in advance of or in the course of the trial was not an interlocutory judgment within the meaning of s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. The submission must be immediately rejected. Sub-section 5F(3A) expressly provides that an appeal may be brought on the admissibility of evidence ""but only if the decision or ruling … substantially weakens the prosecution's case"". This provision came into effect on 14 February 2004, after the decision in Steffan. Accordingly, provided the second part of s.5F(3A) is satisfied, the appeal has been properly brought. 
     
      
    49 The appellant contended that the Crown had failed to demonstrate that the ruling substantially weakens its case. In my opinion, an assessment of that matter is very much bound up with the question whether an order should have been made under s.137. If the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice, as I have found, then the exclusion of the evidence would, in my opinion, substantially weaken the Crown case. Were it otherwise, the respondent could, and on present indications will, conduct a defence that she was ignorant of the drugs in her home but was suspicious that her husband was involved in drug dealing and that she hid the black bag so as to protect him. There were other explanations raised in her ERISP relating to her ignorance of the contents of the bag and the items found in the children’s bedroom. These explanations may be plausible. However, the plausibility of such innocent explanations is diminished when regard is had to the respondent’s own drug dealing. Accordingly, in my opinion, the ruling substantially weakens the Crown case. 
     
      
    50 The respondent further submitted that it was undesirable for this Court to make any ruling in relation to the evidence in circumstances where no jury had been empanelled at the time that the trial judge rejected the evidence: see R v Milakovic [2004] NSWCCA 199 at [10]. However, Milakovic involved a different question altogether. In that case the Court was concerned with the rejection of an application to cross-examine a witness as an unfavourable witness pursuant to s.38 of the Evidence Act. The Court held that a ruling under s.38 was not a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence within the meaning of s.5F(3A). Section 5F(3A) expressly governs this case and permits an appeal by the Crown against an interlocutory ruling, regardless of whether or not a jury has been empanelled. But in any event, the ruling was made in circumstances where, although a jury had not been empanelled, the issue as to whether the evidence should be excluded was agitated at the request of the respondent as part of a pre-trial procedure. Once the ruling was made, the Crown indicated to the trial judge that the DPP wanted time to consider whether an appeal should be brought from his Honour’s ruling. That time was allowed so that the empanelment of the jury did not proceed. 
     
      
    51 It follows in my opinion that the appeal should be allowed. I would propose that the application made by the respondent that the evidence be rejected, be refused. 
     
      
    52 I propose the following Orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal is allowed. 
       
       
      2. Set aside the ruling on evidence by Maguire DCJ on 29 November 2005 as to the exclusion of evidence of two offences of “ 
      supply heroin 
      ” contrary to s.25(1) of the 
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (NSW) 
       1985 on 28 September 2004 and 20 October 2004. 
       
       
      3. Order that the respondent’s application to have the evidence excluded be dismissed. 
       
      
    53 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Beazley JA. I take a different approach. I will recapitulate briefly the relevant background. 
     
      
    54 The respondent is charged, under s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Act”), with a single count of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin. The offence is alleged to have been committed on 3 November 2004 in the home the respondent shared with her husband and four children in Macquarie Fields. The Crown case is that, on the execution of a search warrant on that day, police located in the house a quantity (5.74 grams) of heroin, together with a sum of more than $5,000 in cash, and other items associated with the supply of heroin. They claim to have observed the respondent attempt to conceal a small black bag which was later shown to contain some drug-related items. 
     
      
    55 The Crown alleges that the drug was in the possession of the respondent; by reason of s29 of the Act, and the quantity of the drug, her possession, if proved, is deemed to have been for the purpose of supply (unless she were able to prove that it was in her possession for some other purpose); by s3 of the Act, possession for the purposes of supply amounts to supply and founds such a charge. 
     
      
    56 The respondent was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. No jury was empanelled. The Crown proposes to tender in evidence, as well as the evidence produced by the execution of the search warrant and the items located, and the other evidence apparently implicating the respondent, evidence of two earlier offences of supply of heroin committed by the respondent to which she entered pleas of guilty. The first of these was committed on 28 September 2005; the second on 20 October 2005. On each occasion the respondent directly supplied a quantity of heroin to an undercover police operative. 
     
      
    57 Following the respondent’s plea of not guilty, on her behalf a challenge was made to the admission of the evidence of the prior offences and her pleas of guilty in relation to them. In a judgment dated 29 November 2005 Maguire DCJ rejected the evidence. He gave as his reason: 
     
      
       
        
        “Doing the best I can I think that the probative force of the proposed evidence is outweighed by the prejudicial effect that it would have ...” 
        
       
       
      The trial was then adjourned, without a jury having been empanelled. 
       
      
    58 The Crown appeals against the decision to reject the evidence. It is able to pursue an appeal against the rejection of evidence only if the appeal comes within s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Since the decision in question involves a decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, the Crown may pursue the appeal only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution case.  
     
      
       
      jurisdiction 
       
      
    59 A threshold question therefore arises. On behalf of the respondent it was argued that the Crown has failed to demonstrate, for the purpose of the sub-section, that the ruling eliminates or substantially weakens its case. It was further argued that it is undesirable for this Court to make rulings on the admission of evidence in advance of the trial. 
     
      
    60 In some respects, the Crown case, absent this evidence, appears to be reasonably strong. It includes evidence of the execution of the search warrant, of the money and various drug-related items in the house, and the respondent’s conduct in appearing to conceal the black bag which was later found to contain drug-related items. On the other hand, the respondent was not the sole (or the sole adult) occupant of the house; her husband, who was also charged, but who was to be tried separately, lived in the house. The Crown may well run into difficulties of the kind exposed in R v Filipetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335, in establishing that the drugs were in the possession of the respondent, and not in the exclusive possession of her husband. Indeed, it is understood that that is the basis on which the respondent proposes to defend the charge. 
     
      
    61 Evidence of two previous instances of actual supply of the drug, one two weeks earlier, the other five weeks earlier, is capable of substantially strengthening the Crown case. The corollary is that the exclusion of the evidence is capable of substantially weakening the Crown case. In my opinion the prospect that the respondent might successfully defend the charge on the basis to be found in Filipetti is such that this Court should conclude that exclusion of the evidence would substantially weaken the Crown case. The case therefore comes with s5F(3A) and the appeal should be permitted to proceed. 
     
      
       
      the appeal 
       
      
    62 The basis on which the evidence was tendered by the Crown was outlined by the Crown Prosecutor in the District Court as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour it is on the basis that this evidence that shows that the Accused was in the business of dealing heroin, it’s what’s referred to as the indicia of supply, in the sense it’s not tendency or propensity evidence you Honour, it is simply evidence that shows that at that relevant time, that around the time of the deemed supply, that she was engaged in the business of supplying heroin ...” 
        
       
      
    63 The Crown Prosecutor made reference to the decisions of this Court in R v Sultana (1992) 74 A Crim R 27 and of the High Court in R v Harriman [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590. After lengthy debate, counsel for the respondent said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... these are extremely prejudicial matters your Honour. That’s the essence of what I’ll come to in due course. In terms of this accused getting a fair trial, in relation to a deemed supply, to have previous charges of actual supply used in that context, different time, different place, it smacks of the dangers of the jury using that evidence of the earlier matters in an impermissible way, a purely prejudicial way.” 
        
       
       
      A little later he said: 
       
       
        
        “The other thing that occurs to me your Honour on this point, is that the Crown did or perhaps does have available to it, other avenues such as tendency and coincidence provisions and the like, and they have not been available.” 
        
       
      
    64 It appears that the argument before Maguire DCJ was based purely upon either or both of ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. The terms of the judgment do not suggest that either of those sections was applied in precise terms. Reliance on the tendency evidence provisions contained in s97 of the Evidence Act was expressly disclaimed. It continued to be expressly disclaimed in this Court. When confronted with the purpose for which the Crown sought to tender the evidence the Crown Prosecutor in this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... it is tendered to show that there was a connection between her and the drugs that were found in the house which she and her husband jointly inhabited.” 
        
       
       
      Later the Crown Prosecutor said: 
       
       
        
        “... [the respondent] had said in effect: I have got nothing to do with these drugs. The Crown had to overcome that. It had to show that she did because it had to overcome the problem. One of the ways in which the Crown elected to try to do that was to tender the evidence that she was carrying on a business.” 
        
       
      
    65 “Tendency evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as: 
     
      
       
        
        “... evidence of a kind referred to in subsection 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” 
        
       
       
      S97(1) provides: 
       
       
        
        “97 The tendency rule 
         
         
        (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
         
          
           
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    66 Because the Crown disclaimed any reliance upon s97, no notice of the kind referred in subs(1)(a) was given. That may, for the moment, be put to one side. S97 does not necessarily preclude the admission of any evidence that shows that an accused person has committed another crime, or has a tendency or disposition or propensity to commit a crime whether of a specific or general nature: see Harriman; Sultana; R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82; R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519. S97 precludes the admission of the evidence (unless it overcomes the test imposed by subs(1)(b)) where it is tendered for that purpose; where it is tendered for another purpose, such as those mentioned in the authorities I have cited, even where it also incidentally proves criminal disposition or tendency, it is not necessarily rendered inadmissible, although it would then be necessary to give consideration to s95 of the Evidence Act, and to give the jury appropriate directions. 
     
      
    67 It is, of course, necessary precisely to analyse the manner in which the Crown would seek to use the evidence. That was disclosed clearly in the argument, both in the District Court and on appeal – it was expressed as tendered to prove that the respondent was a drug dealer. 
     
      
    68 I am (with respect to Beazley JA who takes a different view) quite unable to see that this evidence was tendered for any reason other than to prove that the respondent had a tendency to deal in drugs. Even if it were to be said that the evidence was tendered to rebut the respondent’s anticipated defence, that the drugs and other items were the property of her husband, and that their presence within the home was not within her knowledge, nevertheless that rebuttal was to be achieved by showing that she had a tendency to supply and deal in drugs. This, in my opinion, emerges quite clearly from the responses given by the Crown Prosecutor on the appeal. Evidence of the respondent’s previous drug dealings was tendered to show that she was in possession of the drugs the subject of the present charge; the evidence of her previous drug dealings would help to establish her guilt of the present charge because it would show that she had a tendency so to behave. 
     
      
    69 That, to my mind, does not necessarily render the evidence inadmissible. It simply means that the appropriate procedures had to be followed and the necessary tests applied. I outlined these in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 at [33] and [45]. 
     
      
    70 The first task is to assess the extent to which the evidence in question has probative value (that is, the capacity rationally to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue); secondly (where the answer to that question is in the affirmative), to assess and predict the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence. Where the result of that assessment is that the evidence would not, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, have significant probative value, the evidence is not to be admitted. Where, however, the assessment is that the evidence would have significant probative value, the court must then apply s101 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence ... adduced by prosecution 
         
         
        (1) ... 
         
         
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant ... that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    71 Because of the view I take of the nature of the evidence in question, ss135 and 137 are immaterial. S97 and s101(2) provide the tests for the admission of tendency evidence; in my opinion, they leave no room for the application also of either s135 or s137. 
     
      
    72 Because of the approach taken by the Crown, and the defence, in the District Court, Maguire DCJ did not turn his mind to whether the evidence should be admitted under s97, nor whether s101(2) should operate to exclude the evidence. The appropriate findings of fact and assessments have not been made. 
     
      
    73 In my opinion the orders this Court should make are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) appeal allowed; 
         
         
        (ii) decision to reject the evidence vacated; the matter remitted to be determined by the District Court in accordance with these reasons. 
        
       
      
    74 ROTHMAN J: I have read in draft the judgment of Beazley JA. I have also had the advantage of having read in draft the reasons for judgment of Simpson J. I agree with the reasons for judgment of Simpson J. I also join in the orders proposed by Simpson J with some misgivings. I wish to add the following comments. I do not repeat the factual background or the provisions of the statutes.  
     
      
    75 Fundamentally the issue in this appeal is the admissibility of evidence in proceedings on the current charges of prior offences for the supply of heroin. The Crown sought to have the material tendered and admitted on the basis that it was relevant evidence and the Crown eschewed a reliance on tendency evidence. As summarised by Beazley JA, “the Crown seeks to adduce the evidence of the prior offences so as to prove the respondent was a drug dealer and that her association with the drugs in her home was not innocent.” (see [25], infra) 
     
      
       
      Tendency Evidence 
       
      
    76 In R v Fletcher, supra, the Court considered the question of tendency evidence in a quite different way than the issue arises in these proceedings. There was little, if any, difference on the principles to be applied in relation to tendency evidence between the majority (Simpson and Johnson JJ) and my dissenting judgment; the difference ultimately was the application of those principles to the facts in that case. In R v Fletcher, the Crown sought to tender material on the basis of s.97 of the Evidence Act and the question before the Court was whether the Judge in admitting some of the evidence was correct, i.e. whether the evidence sought to be tendered met the requirements of s.97 of the Act.  
     
      
    77 In this case, the Crown seeks to tender evidence which it says is not being adduced to prove tendency. In other words, the Court is not faced with the issue of whether the evidence satisfies s.97 of the Act, but rather whether s.97 of the Act applies to exclude the evidence; i.e. is it tendency evidence?  
     
      
    78 Unless excluded by a specific provision of the Evidence Act, all relevant evidence is admissible: s.56 of the Act. It is relevant if it “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue in the proceeding”: s.55 of the Act. Probative value is the extent to which evidence is relevant. 
     
      
    79 Thus the first question that must be asked by any person seeking to adduce evidence is “could the evidence rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the probability of the existence of a fact in issue?” If the answer to that is in the affirmative, then, subject to exclusionary provisions, it is admissible. But s.97 is an exclusionary provision. It excludes tendency evidence unless the requirements of s.97 are satisfied. 
     
      
    80 Evidence of a tendency that a person has or had, to act in a particular way, or have a particular state of mind, in order to prove that the person did, at the point in time relevant to the issues before the Court, act in a particular way, or have a particular state of mind, is tendency evidence. It will be prohibited, notwithstanding that it is relevant, unless it satisfies s.97 (and in the case of a criminal proceeding, s.101) of the Act. 
     
      
    81 The question that must be asked in relation to such evidence, or indeed any evidence, when evaluating relevance, is precisely how it seeks to make more probable the existence of the fact in issue. If it affects, rationally, the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue by applying a reasoning process described in s.97 (“tendency reasoning”), it is inadmissible unless it has a significant probative value. Section 97 of the Evidence Act is engaged by the purpose and reasoning process, not its rational effect; 
     
      
       
        
        “What is  
        not 
         to be admitted is a chain of reasoning and not necessarily a state of facts. If the inadmissible chain of reasoning be the  
        only 
         purpose for which the evidence is adduced as a matter of law, the evidence is not admissible.” (per Lord Hailsham in  
        DPP v Boardman 
         [1975] AC 421 at 453) 
        
       
      
    82 One must be careful in applying pre-Evidence Act judgments to the admissibility of tendency evidence under the Evidence Act. However, the common law principles on such issues may be used as a guide in the evaluation of the admissibility of evidence, even under the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    83 The High Court in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 summarised the principles applicable, prior to the Evidence Act, in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Propensity evidence is not admissible if it shows  
        only 
         that the accused has a propensity or disposition to commit a crime or that he or she was the sort of person to commit the crime charged. …It was also accepted that in order to be admissible, propensity evidence must possess ‘a strong degree of probative force’ or the probative force … must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of  
        mere 
         criminality or propensity.” (at pp 480-481) (The emphasis is my own) 
        
       
      
    84 To a large degree the provisions of s.97 reflect the above passage from the joint judgment of their Honours Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. Once the “propensity” or “tendency” reasoning process is involved, the prima facie position is that the evidence is inadmissible, unless it has a significant probative value. In other words, the reasoning process adopted must show something more than that the accused has a disposition to commit the crime or is the sort of person to commit the crime.  
     
      
    85 In Quach, supra, the evidence sought to be admitted was intercepted telephone conversations which went to the totality of the conduct giving rise to the supply of drugs on the particular occasion with which the accused was charged. In other words the evidence was admissible because it formed the totality of the conduct leading up to the charge in question and its probative value did not depend on tendency reasoning.  
     
      
    86 The material that was sought to be tendered in these proceedings was material relating to two past offences for the purpose of proving that the accused was a drug dealer. The relevance of that material was to show that the accused had a tendency or state of mind inconsistent with an innocent explanation for the existence of the drugs on premises which the accused occupied. Its probative value is that, because the accused has previously been convicted (not that long ago) of conduct amounting to dealing in drugs, it is more likely that the accused is still dealing in drugs and that, therefore, the existence of the drugs on her premises is not innocent. That is classic propensity reasoning.  
     
      
    87 It is evidence of a tendency (to deal in drugs), to act in a particular way (to deal in drugs), to have a particular state of mind (the intention to use drugs impermissibly or knowledge of the existence of the drugs), adduced in order to prove that the respondent did, at the time that drugs were found on premises she occupied (the date of offence), act in a particular way (have possession of the drugs), or have a particular state of mind (the intention to use the drugs found). It fits precisely the description in s.97 of the Act of the reasoning process which renders evidence propensity evidence. 
     
      
    88 Even prior to the Evidence Act a number of the cases involving the admissibility of propensity evidence turned on the use of the evidence to disprove innocent explanation or coincidence. It relies on an inference drawn from human experience which would render the innocent explanation improbable. See, for example, Noor Mohamed v The King [1949] AC 182.  
     
      
    89 Harriman, supra, is not inconsistent with the analysis in Pfennig (and in any event, pre-dates it). In Harriman, the distinction is made by Brennan J (as he then was) between “the mere commission of another offence or predisposition to commit an offence” and the situation where “as a matter of human experience, the evidence tends to establish the offence charged or a fact in issue otherwise than by showing merely the commission of another offence.” (emphasis is mine) 
     
      
    90 The difficulty in analysing the pre-Evidence Act cases in light of the Evidence Act is that, pre-Evidence Act, propensity was used in two quite distinct ways. It was predominantly used to refer to the process of reasoning which relies upon the commission (or evidence) of one offence, and the tendency to criminality, to prove another offence before the courts. It is there used to refer to a chain of reasoning which, when it does not go beyond that referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, is impermissible. But under the common law, such evidence is permissible and admissible when it goes, on the basis of human experience, to the probability of the commission of the very offence with which the accused has been charged.  
     
      
    91 Section 97 seeks to implement a distinction which, in general, the pre-Evidence Act cases proposed. Section 97 deals with all evidence, whether or not admissible, that is probative because of “tendency reasoning”. It renders it inadmissible unless its probative value is significant. That exception is the Evidence Act equivalent of the common law allowing evidence that goes to the probability of the very offence before the Court and was, under the common law, admissible.  
     
      
    92 Because the evidence sought to be adduced before the sentencing judge was tendency evidence: it relies on tendency reasoning: it is inadmissible unless and until the requirements of s.97 of the Act are satisfied. 
     
      
    93 In the instant proceedings, as already stated, the Crown did not rely, before his Honour, on the provisions of s.97 and did not seek to show that the evidence in question satisfied s.97 (and ultimately s.101(2)). In those circumstances, his Honour was correct to reject the evidence on the basis proffered by the Crown. Such a rejection would not prohibit the Crown from seeking to tender the material again on a different basis. For that reason, ordinarily, I would be inclined to dismiss the appeal and leave it to the Crown to determine whether, and in what circumstances, it would seek again to tender the material.  
     
      
    94 However, given both my agreement with the reasons of Simpson J and the manner in which the matter has been argued, I join in the orders proposed by her Honour, namely: that the appeal be allowed, the decision to reject the evidence be vacated; and the matter be remitted to be determined by the District Court. Such a determination must depend upon notice being given which should particularise the tendency sought to be proven and its probative value. Of course, his Honour may waive notice pursuant to the terms of s.100 of the Evidence Act, but that is a matter within his Honour’s discretion upon which I do not comment.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: On 16 February 2005, following a trial by jury, the appellant was convicted on an indictment that charged her with a single count of robbery with wounding in circumstances of aggravation. The victim of the offence was Mrs Ivon El-Sobky. (It was never in issue that the offence had been committed, the issue for jury determination was whether the appellant had been proven to be the perpetrator.) Pursuant to s96 of the Crimes Act 1900 the conviction exposed the appellant to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. On 10 May 2005 Nield DCJ sentenced her to imprisonment for eight years, commencing on 16 February 2005, with a non-parole period of five years, expiring on 10 February 2010. 
     
      
    3 The appellant now appeals against her conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    4 The case has some unusual features. Initially, only one ground of appeal was pleaded, concerning directions given to the jury with respect to evidence of identification. At the hearing leave was sought on behalf of the appellant, and granted, to add a ground that the verdict was unreasonable and unable to be supported on the evidence. 
     
      
       
      the Crown case 
       
      
    5 What immediately follows is an account of the case presented by the Crown. It should not be taken to represent any findings or conclusions of fact. Given the twists and turns that eventuated in the prosecution of the appellant, it is convenient to set out the history in chronological sequence. Very little of the factual history is in dispute. 
     
      
    6 The Crown case was that, at about 7.00 or 7.30 pm on the evening of 18 January 2003, Mrs El-Sobky and her three children travelled by taxi to the Uniting Church in Liverpool. Mrs El-Sobky was carrying a handbag, containing a number of items, including a camera, a bible, personal papers, taxi vouchers and a sum of money in cash. Having briefly entered the church, Mrs El-Sobky returned outside in order to make a telephone call to her husband, Hesham El-Sobky. They arranged that he would drive to the church, for the purpose of delivering another sum of money to her. He did so, travelling in a gold Nissan. He gave her $500. Mrs El-Sobky placed this in her handbag. Mrs El-Sobky remained in the garden of the church, speaking on her mobile telephone. She felt something that she shortly after described as a needle or knife in her back. She looked to her left and saw a woman holding a knife. The woman was attempting to take Mrs El-Sobky’s handbag, saying “leave the handbag.” With the knife she slashed Mrs El-Sobky’s hand and arm. She ran off with the handbag. 
     
      
    7 It was the Crown case that the woman was the appellant. 
     
      
    8 What happened after the incident in the church was observed, or partly observed, by two men, Uday Chand and Reg Deo, who, at the time, were nearby in a car. They did not witness the incident itself. They saw a woman run across the road from the church carrying a black handbag in her left hand. She was wearing black (Mr Chand) or blue or black (Mr Deo) pants and a beige t-shirt. Both described her as being of middle-eastern appearance. She entered the front passenger seat of a brown Nissan parked on the incorrect side of the road. The driver’s seat of the Nissan was occupied by a man, also of middle-eastern appearance. When the woman entered the passenger seat of the vehicle, he drove off quickly, so quickly as almost to collide with a taxi coming in the opposite direction. Mr Chand noted the registration number of the Nissan as AIM 72E. This was a vehicle registered in the name of Mark David, a name by which Hesham El-Sobky was also known. 
     
      
    9 Police were called to the scene. Constable Bell (who gave evidence under her married name of Honey) spoke to Mrs El-Sobky. Mrs El-Sobky nominated “Cassandra Collins” as her attacker. Constable Bell asked how she knew Cassandra Collins, to which Mrs El-Sobky replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have an AVO against her. She has been trying to get my husband. She wants him to marry her.” 
        
       
      
    10 (There was in fact some history involving the appellant and Mrs El-Sobky. The appellant had been involved in an extra-marital relationship with Hesham El-Sobky. She had given birth to a child, of whom she claimed (wrongly, as was later shown) he was the father. The Department of Community Services had become involved and had contacted Mr El-Sobky. Mrs El-Sobky had become aware of the relationship. At some point Hesham El-Sobky, either alone or jointly with Mrs El-Sobky, had sought and obtained against the appellant an Apprehended Violence Order.) 
     
      
    11 Mrs El-Sobky described Cassandra Collins as: 
     
      
       
        
        “She is Fijian, islander looking, about in her twenties, brown hair, large build, 170 cm tall, wearing dark navy black pants, t-shirt top in beige or white.” 
        
       
      
    12 Mrs El-Sobky was taken to Liverpool Hospital, where she was again spoken to by Constable Bell. There she gave a more detailed account of the incident. She again nominated Cassandra Collins as her assailant. She itemised the contents of her stolen handbag, including the bible, letters, gold jewellery, money, taxi vouchers and a camera. 
     
      
    13 Later that evening, at about 10.00 pm, Constable Bell was on duty at the Liverpool Police Station. Mr Chand and Mr Deo were present for the purpose of making statements about what they had observed. At about 10.20 pm Hesham El-Sobky and Mrs El-Sobky, with their three children, also arrived at the police station. Both Mr Chand and Mr Deo spontaneously identified Mr El-Sobky as the driver of the Nissan in which the woman they had observed had driven off. Constable Bell asked Mr El-Sobky his name. He identified himself as Mark David. 
     
      
    14 Hesham El-Sobky’s Nissan was then searched by police. The search produced a lady’s black wallet, containing personal papers and a small black bible, and a camera. These items were found under the lining of the boot near the spare tyre. Hesham El-Sobky was then arrested and charged. He later pleaded guilty to an accessorial offence. 
     
      
    15 On 23 January 2003 Mrs El-Sobky again attended at the Liverpool Police Station. On this occasion she took with her some gold jewellery which she said was the jewellery she had previously reported as having been stolen, but which she had found in another handbag at home. With the assistance of an Arabic interpreter she made a statement. She repeated her account of the incident at the church, and again nominated Cassandra Collins as the perpetrator of the assault. She said that she had met Cassandra Collins a few months earlier at a club, with Hesham El-Sobky, and repeated that Cassandra Collins wanted to marry Hesham El-Sobky. She also said that Cassandra Collins had been present at court when she and Hesham El Sobky sought an Apprehended Violence Order. She described Cassandra Collins as 20 years old, and gave her date of birth as 23 March 1983. She then described her as “from a Fijian background” and described the clothing she was wearing on 18 January. 
     
      
    16 The following day, 24 January, Mrs El-Sobky telephoned 000. She told the operator that Cassandra Collins, who she said was “the lady ... she take my bag and cut my hand by knife” was at a McDonalds restaurant in Liverpool. She asked police to go to the restaurant and arrest her. 
     
      
    17 Mrs El-Sobky telephoned police again on the same day, complaining that the appellant had not been arrested, but had evaded police when they called at the restaurant. She gave police an address that she said was the appellant’s residence. 
     
      
    18 On 29 January 2003 the appellant was interviewed by police and the interview electronically recorded. Four things of note are contained in the interview: (i) she gave her date of birth as 22 March 1983; (ii) in answer to a question whether she knew Mrs El-Sobky she said that she did, that she had been introduced to her by Mrs El-Sobky’s husband, who she knew as Mark David; that she had known Mrs El-Sobky for about a year, and that Mrs El-Sobky had been telephoning her and harassing her; (iii) she said that she had not seen or spoken to Mrs El-Sobky since the Apprehended Violence Order was taken out; (iv) she said that on 18 January 2003 she had been in Port Macquarie with her father; that her father had driven from his home in Kendall near Port Macquarie on 14 January to pick her up from her home in Liverpool and had driven her to his home in Kendall on 16 January; and that she had returned to Sydney on 20 January by train. 
     
      
    19 Apart from that, the appellant denied having been involved in the assault on Mrs El-Sobky. 
     
      
    20 On 3 February 2003 the appellant telephoned Mrs El-Sobky at her home. Shortly after that, on the same day, she visited Mrs El-Sobky at her home. Hesham El-Sobky was also present. There was a conversation about the Apprehended Violence Order. Mrs El-Sobky telephoned police who attended immediately. Mrs El-Sobky agreed to “cancel” the Apprehended Violence Order. She wrote a note, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “To whom it may concern, 
         
        My name is Ivon El-Sobky. I live at 10 Humphreys Avenue, Casula 2170. I am writing this letter in regards to charges I made on a lady by the name of Cassandra Collins. I would like to cancel all charges. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please forgive me. Thank you very much. 
         
        Yours sincerely.” 
        
       
       
      She signed the note and dated it 13 February 2003, the day she sent it to police. 
       
      
    21 On 5 February 2003 Mr Chand took part in a photographic identification procedure. He was shown a series of photographs of women, including the appellant. He failed from the photographs to identify the appellant as the woman he had seen on 18 January. On 25 February Mr Deo undertook a similar exercise. He identified two of the photographs as being similar to the woman he had seen on 18 January. Neither of these was, in fact, a photograph of the appellant. 
     
      
    22 On 10 March Mrs El-Sobky wrote a second letter. The letter read: 
     
      
       
        
        “To whom it may concern, 
         
        This is to certify that Cassandra Collins neither assaulted me nor abused me on the 18th of January 2003. It is a misunderstanding on my behalf when I did a police report against her, it was a mistake. I thought she was the one who hit me because I know she had an affair with my husband. But when I saw her in the house on the 3rd of the 2nd 2003 I was certain that neither that face nor that profile is the one that hit me before. 
        
       
       
        
        Police took her from the house because she breached the AVO. When I complained against her the police didn’t show me a photo of her and I strongly believe that keeping her locked up is a mistake. 
        
       
       
        
        Any further inquiries regarding a statement from anyone, please do not hesitate to contact me at the abovementioned address or telephone. 
        
       
       
        
        Yours sincerely 
        
       
       
        
        Ivon El-Sobky” 
        
       
      
    23 On 9 April 2003 leading Senior Constable Carl Blick, who was then attached to the Laurieton Police Station, spoke to the appellant’s father, Terry Collins, at his home in Kendall. Mr Collins told Senior Constable Blick that the appellant was not at his home between 18 and 20 January 2003, and that he had last seen her in December 2002 at Cabramatta in Sydney. She had not been to his home for the past seven or eight months. Mr Collins declined to give a formal statement, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “No I don’t want to give a statement because I am her father. There are family considerations.” 
        
       
      
    24 On 25 June 2003 Mrs El-Sobky met with Ms Fiona Kay, a solicitor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (“ODPP”), and Detective Fiona Frame, the officer in charge of the investigation. An Arabic interpreter was also present. During the course of that meeting Hesham El-Sobky telephoned his wife more than once, and she telephoned him. In one of these conversations, Mrs El-Sobky told her husband that she was still being questioned. The following conversation ensued: 
     
      
       
        
        Hesham El-Sobky: Did you tell them what I told you to say? 
        
       
       
        
        Mrs El-Sobky: Yes, but they said to me you might go to gaol with your husband. 
        
       
       
        
        Hesham El-Sobky: Don’t worry, just tell them what I told you, the court will decide, not them. 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Kay questioned Mrs El-Sobky about the letters of 13 February and 10 March. Mrs El-Sobky was reluctant to disclose to Ms Kay who had typed the second letter; Ms Kay expressed some concern about the bona fides of the document and told Mrs El-Sobky that the ODPP was in possession of other evidence linking Hesham El-Sobky to the offence. Mrs El-Sobky appeared shocked and asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “What evidence?” 
        
       
       
      Ms Kay was not prepared to discuss the nature of the evidence with her. Mrs El-Sobky said: 
       
       
        
        “He not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    26 On the first day of the trial, 9 February 2005, Constable Bell was waiting outside the court. Mrs El-Sobky engaged her in conversation (on the subject of Constable Bell’s ill health). Constable Bell then asked Mrs El-Sobky if she still had an Apprehended Violence Order against the appellant. Mrs El-Sobky repied: 
     
      
       
        
        “No since she stabbed [me] my husband and I have no problems with her any more.” 
        
       
      
    27 Hesham El-Sobky was charged as an accessory after the fact of armed robbery. On 2 February he pleaded guilty to the charge. 
     
      
       
      the trial 
       
      
    28 Mrs El-Sobky was the first witness to be called in the trial. It soon became apparent that the evidence she would give would, in one crucial respect, dramatically depart from the accounts she had given soon after the attack upon her. Of the offence itself, she gave an account consistent with that she had previously given. She said that she had mistakenly believed that the gold jewellery was in the handbag she was carrying, but that she had forgotten that she had left it in another handbag at home. The departure from her earlier account came when she was asked, in her evidence in chief, if she knew the woman who had taken her bag. She said that she did not. She said that she had never seen that woman before. 
     
      
    29 As a consequence the Crown Prosecutor (who had obviously anticipated this development) sought, under s38 of the Evidence Act 1995, leave to question her as though cross-examining. After a voir dire, leave was granted. There is no challenge to that ruling. 
     
      
    30 The Crown Prosecutor then proceeded to cross-examine Mrs El-Sobky in the presence of the jury. 
     
      
    31 Mrs El-Sobky maintained that she did not know who had attacked her, but said that she knew that it was a female because of her hair, her body shape and her clothing. She did “not that much” see her face, and only looked at her face for a few seconds. She said that she suspected that it was Cassandra Collins because of her relationship with Hesham El-Sobky, and the birth of the child, and she thought Cassandra Collins probably intended to kill her so that she could live with Hesham El-Sobky. She said that she looked at her assailant’s face for one or two seconds, but was not concentrating on her face. She said that, at the time she first nominated Cassandra Collins (on 18 January) as her attacker, and again on 23 January, she had neither seen nor met Cassandra Collins. 
     
      
    32 She denied that she had told police that she had met Cassandra Collins at a club, saying that she did not go to clubs. She said that what she meant by the statement she made to police was that the appellant had met her husband at a club. 
     
      
    33 She explained that part of her statement of 23 January in which she said that she had known Cassandra Collins for a few months as meaning that she had known of Cassandra Collins, and of Cassandra Collins’ relationship with Hesham El-Sobky, for that time. She explained her description of Cassandra Collins as “from a Fijian background” by saying that she had heard from Hesham El-Sobky that Cassandra Collins was of Fijian extraction, or had Fijian parentage. She said she had tailored her description of her attacker to fit what she knew of Cassandra Collins. 
     
      
    34 Mrs El-Sobky was asked about the events of 24 January, when she had claimed to have seen her attacker (whom she again identified as Cassandra Collins) in a McDonalds restaurant. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw someone sitting at McDonalds and I thought that could be the woman who had attacked me.” 
        
       
       
      She said that she did not then know what Cassandra Collins looked like. When asked why she had told police that she had seen Cassandra Collins, and named her as the woman who had taken her bag, she said: 
       
       
        
        “I was just under the impression that that woman was the same woman who took my bag and cut my hand and that was Cassandra who was sitting at McDonalds.” 
        
       
       
      A little later, when asked a question in similar terms, she said: 
       
       
        
        “Yeah well that’s what I wanted because as I said, I was afraid of the person who robbed me and I thought that she was everywhere, wherever I went, I was under the impression that that lady was around.” 
        
       
      
    35 Notwithstanding that she acknowledged having said, in her statement of 23 January, that she had seen Cassandra Collins at court during the Apprehended Violence Order proceedings, in cross-examination by the Crown she denied having been present at those proceedings. 
     
      
    36 She said the first time she saw Cassandra Collins was when she came to her home on 3 February 2003. It was only then that she realised that the woman who had robbed her was not Cassandra Collins. 
     
      
    37 She said the note of 10 March was typed by a fellow parishioner of her church. She was asked about the June meeting with Ms Kay and Senior Constable Frame. She maintained that this meeting was arranged because a car registered in her name had been involved in an accident. She said they did not discuss the attack upon her or the robbery. She said that the conversation she had had with her husband related to that accident. She was asked about the conversation Constable Bell claimed to have had with her on the first day of the trial. She denied having said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, since she stabbed me, my husband and I have no problems with her any more.” 
        
       
       
      Her account of the conversation was: 
       
       
        
        “This did not take place at all. What happened is that she asked me ‘Is everything alright between you and your husband?’ I said, ‘Yes’. And then she said ‘Is there an AVO against Cassandra now?’ I said, ‘No there is no AVO now because my husband went to court and cancelled it.’ I didn’t tell her anything about that Cassandra stabbed me or anything like that. Besides if it was really Cassandra who stabbed me, I wouldn’t have cancelled the AVO.” 
        
       
      
    38 In cross-examination on behalf of the appellant the fact that her husband had been charged as an accessory, and had pleaded guilty, was elicited. 
     
      
    39 Mr Chand also gave evidence in the trial. His evidence was unremarkable, and in accordance with what he had previously told police. Mr Deo did not give evidence. His statement was read to the jury. It was generally accepted that the woman they had seen, and described, was the woman who attacked Mrs El-Sobky. 
     
      
    40 The photographs that had been shown to Mr Chand and Mr Deo were in evidence. These included a photograph of the appellant. The photograph showed the appellant as having a dark or olive complexion, and dark hair and eyes. 
     
      
    41 Mr Amjad Oweis, an officer of the State Rail Authority, also gave evidence. Mr Oweis conducted a search for any record of travel by the appellant from Kendall to Sydney between 19 and 21 January. Using a number of different searches, he checked every train travelling from north to south towards Sydney. He found no record of the appellant having travelled. Only one person by the name of Collins had travelled during that time. That was not the appellant. 
     
      
    42 The appellant’s father, Terrence Collins, was also called. He was not a satisfactory witness. Contrary to what (on the Crown case) he had told Senior Constable Blick, he said that he had seen the appellant both in Sydney and in Kendall during December 2002 and January 2003. He could not be precise about the dates. He denied having told Constable Blick that the appellant had not been to his home for the past seven or eight months. 
     
      
    43 Accordingly, leave was granted under s38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Mr Collins. This cross-examination did not make any inroads on his evidence in chief. Leading Senior Constable Blick was then called and gave evidence as set out above: that is, that Mr Collins had told him that the appellant was not at his home between 18 and 23 January 2003, that the last time he had seen her was in December 2002 at Cabramatta, and that the appellant had not been to his home for the past seven or eight months. He said that Mr Collins had declined to provide a written statement, saying that was because he was her father and there were family considerations. 
     
      
       
      the grounds of the appeal against conviction 
       
       
      ground 2: unreasonable verdict 
       
      
    44 I have outlined above the two grounds advanced on behalf of the appellant. Because, if it were to succeed, it would result in a verdict of acquittal, it is convenient to deal first with the second ground, that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. It can be dealt with succinctly. The principles on which this Court will set aside a verdict on that ground are well known and do not need restatement. They are to be found expressed in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; and many other cases. On behalf of the appellant it was put: 
     
      
       
        
        “Conviction required acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of Mrs El-Sobky’s nomination on 18 and 23 January 2003 of the appellant as her attacker, such evidence being adduced for a hearsay purpose. The jury had no advantage over this Court in assessing such evidence, as it did not see or hear Mrs El-Sobky make such nominations.” 
        
       
       
      No point has been taken that the evidence could not properly be used, under the hearsay provisions of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , as evidence of the truth of what Mrs El-Sobky asserted on the occasions in question. It was plainly admissible for that purpose. The focus of the ground of appeal lay in the inherent and obvious unreliability of Mrs El-Sobky as a witness. There is no doubt that her credibility was minimal. But it was open to the jury to conclude that her lack of credibility affected the evidence she gave in the trial as distinct from what she had said to Senior Constable Bell. 
       
      
    45 I do accept that, before the jury was entitled to convict, it was necessary that it accept beyond reasonable doubt that the nomination of the appellant as her attacker by Mrs El-Sobky on those dates was both truthful and correct. What I do not accept is the appellant’s second proposition, put by counsel, that the jury had no advantage over this Court in assessing that evidence. The jury had the advantage of observing Mrs El-Sobky give her evidence denying knowing or having met the appellant, and her tortured explanations for her earlier statements to police and other aspects of the Crown case. It was not necessary, for the jury to reach a view about which of Mrs El-Sobky’s two accounts was truthful, that it see her give each of them. It was sufficient that the jury could see, as it could, Mrs El-Sobky retracting her earlier version. In this respect it was well placed to make an assessment of Mrs El-Sobky’s credibility, and certainly better placed than this Court. 
     
      
    46 Counsel then set out nine features of Mrs El-Sobky’s evidence which, she argued, showed that the crucial evidence (of identification and nomination) lacked credibility, displayed inadequacies, and has been demonstrated to lack probative value. 
     
      
    47 It may be accepted that the evidence directly given by Mrs El-Sobky did bear those characteristics. But the evidence that she gave which bore those characteristics was the evidence of denial and retraction. It was not the original statements made by Mrs El-Sobky to Constable Bell. I have no doubt that this was how the jury perceived it. There were, indeed, some (sometimes subtle) pointers in the evidence to support what she had earlier said. For example, she gave the appellant’s date of birth as 23 March 1983; in her recorded interview (which was in evidence) the appellant gave her date of birth as 22 March 1983, suggesting that Mrs El-Sobky was indeed more familiar with the appellant than she claimed to be. It was plain that the retraction came after Hesham El-Sobky had been charged as an accessory. The appellant in her interview confirmed that the two women knew each other. 
     
      
    48 Even a reading of the words on the transcript gives a clear impression that it was Mrs El-Sobky’s later version, not the earlier, that was riddled with doubt and inadequacy. The jury were entitled to contrast the two accounts and determine which of the two was correct. They were entitled, as they clearly did, to opt for the earlier, and immediate, account as representing the true state of affairs. They were entitled, as they clearly did, to reach this view beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    49 The appellant’s acknowledgement, in the second of her interviews, that she knew Mrs El-Sobky was another circumstance relevant (and adverse to the appellant) to the jury’s evaluation of Mrs El-Sobky’s two versions. 
     
      
    50 The appellant could not, in this respect, have been helped by the evidence concerning what her father told Senior Constable Blick, or his (her father’s) obvious lack of cooperation in the trial. This evidence cast serious doubt upon her answers in her interview. 
     
      
    51 There is no basis for concluding that the conviction was unreasonable or was not supported by the evidence. In my opinion the second ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      ground one: directions on identification 
       
      
    52 This ground is framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour’s directions regarding identification evidence and the victim’s out of court representations were inadequate in part, and included evidence which should not have been the subject of a warning, thereby giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    53 Some provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 are relevant to the consideration of this ground. They can conveniently be set out here. They are:  
     
      
    (i) the definition of “identification evidence” contained in the Dictionary, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where: 
         
          
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or 
           
          (ii) an act connected to that offence was done, 
          
         
         
         at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time; or 
         
         
        (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion.”; 
        
       
       
      (ii) S116, which provides as follows: 
       
       
        
        “116  
        Directions to jury 
         
         
        (1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury: 
         
          
           
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence, and 
           
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
          
         
         
        (2) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.”; 
        
       
       
      (iii) S165, which is relevantly in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “165  
        Unreliable evidence 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
         
          
           
          (a) ..., 
           
           
          (b) identification evidence, 
          
         
         
        ... 
         
         
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
         
          
           
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
           
           
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
         
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
         
         
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
         
         
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.” 
        
       
      
    54 The directions given by Neild DCJ were: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the evidence of identification, and this is the evidence of the complainant that Cassandra Collins was her attacker,  
        and the description given by Mrs El-Sobky of her attacker, and the descriptions given by Mr Chand and Mr Deo of the woman who they saw getting into Mrs El-Sobky’s husband’s car 
        , I give you this warning. You must scrutinise the evidence of identification with special care and caution before you decide to accept it. 
        
       
       
        
        I give you this warning because in past trials witnesses have made mistakes in the identification of persons and objects, even though those witnesses have been completely honest people. Furthermore, in past trials, more than one witness in the trial have made mistakes about the identification of person and objects. ... 
        
       
       
        
        So, members of the trial (sic), in trials where the Crown relies upon witnesses’ identification of persons or objects the presiding judge must, and I emphasise ‘must’, give a warning to the jury to scrutinise the evidence of identification with special care and caution. That is one reason for my giving you this warning. You must not think that I have given you this warning because of a view that I have formed about the evidence of identification. 
        
       
       
        
        The other reason for my giving you this warning is obvious, and it is this. Mrs El-Sobky has withdrawn her identification of the accused as her attacker. This means that you have the complainant’s statements, that is Mrs El-Sobky’s statements, identifying the accused as her attacker given to police on 18 January 2003, there were two such statements on that day, which were confirmed to police on 23 January 2003 and repeated to police in the 000 call on 24 January 2003, and Mrs El-Sobky’s withdrawal of that identification by her letter of 10 March 2003, and perhaps by the letter of 13 February 2003. The conflict in the statements of Mrs El-Sobky may mean that Mrs El-Sobky’s evidence is unreliable. So, members of the jury, for these two reasons, (1) that the evidence of identification may be mistaken and (2) that Mrs El-Sobky’s identification may be unreliable, I tell you that you must scrutinise the evidence of identification and particularly that of Mrs El-Sobky with special care and caution.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    55 His Honour went on to tell the jury that, having scrutinised the evidence appropriately, they were entitled to act upon it. He then dealt in more detail with a number of specific questions which he formulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “... did the person making the identification know the person or recognise the object? 
        
       
       
        
        “... what was happening when the identification was made?” 
        
       
       
        
        “... how long did the person making the identification have to observe what was happening?” 
        
       
       
        
        “... what was the distance between the event, what happened, and the person making the identification at the time when the event was observed?” 
        
       
       
        
        “... what was the light at the place when the event was observed by the person making the identification?” 
        
       
       
        
        “... was there anything about the person who or object which was identified which was distinctive?” 
        
       
       
      His Honour gave detailed directions in relation to each of these questions and returned to the description originally given of her attacker by Mrs El-Sobky.  
       
      
    56 Counsel for the appellant drew a distinction between two categories of evidence, which may broadly be characterised as “identification evidence” (although not necessarily within the meaning of the Evidence Act definition). The first category is what she termed the general descriptive evidence – that is, the description of her attacker given by Mrs El-Sobky, and the descriptions of the woman they had observed given by Mr Chand and Mr Deo. The second category was the identification, by Mrs El-Sobky only, of Cassandra Collins as the woman who had perpetrated the robbery. This was identification evidence, properly so called, within the meaning of the definition. 
     
      
    57 As will be seen from the italicised passage in the summing-up, the trial judge treated the two kinds of evidence in the same way, as requiring the same kind of caution on the part of the jury. In a nutshell, the ground was that only Mrs El-Sobky’s identification should have been the subject of the cautionary directions. The descriptive evidence, which counsel sought to turn to the appellant’s advantage, ought not, she argued, to have been the subject of such directions. 
     
      
    58 On behalf of the appellant the submission was (correctly in my opinion) made that the descriptive evidence alone would have been insufficient to sustain the conviction. The conviction depends upon the positive identification by Mrs El-Sobky. 
     
      
    59 Counsel contended that to treat the two kinds of evidence in the same way was erroneous. This was because of the explanation given by Mrs El-Sobky for having wrongly (as she then claimed) nominated the appellant. Her explanation was that, knowing of the appellant’s association with her husband, she had made an assumption that she later learned to be wrong. To support the submission counsel pointed to some common elements between the appearance of the appellant and the descriptions of the woman. These were to do with her body size and build and colouring. She argued that the descriptive evidence assisted the defence because it made it more probable that Mrs El-Sobky’s explanation was correct – that because of the consistency between the descriptions of the woman and the appearance of the appellant, the jury might more readily accept that Mrs El-Sobky had wrongly jumped to a conclusion about the identity of her attacker. Succinctly, counsel submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “With the knowledge that she [Mrs El-Sobky] had of such a woman, it would have been unlikely she would presume the assailant to be Cassandra Collins had she been blonde, pale and petite.” 
        
       
      
    60 There is nothing in the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act that requires a warning to be given in relation to the descriptive evidence. That is for the simple reason that that evidence does not come within the Dictionary definitions of identification evidence. Ss116 and 165 are directed to identification evidence within that definition. S116 did call for a warning in respect of Mrs El-Sobky’s identification. No complaint is made about the terms in which that was given. Counsel complained that to include the descriptive evidence in the warning had two different impacts upon the appellant’s defence. The first she specified as the likelihood that the direction weakened the impact of the warning that was required in relation to the identification evidence properly so called, and genuinely in dispute; the second as the potential of the direction to undermine the exculpatory capacity of the evidence in question (the descriptive evidence). In making this latter submission, counsel relied upon the descriptions of the woman by both Mr Chand and Mr Deo as of middle-eastern (not islander or Fijian) appearance, and the failure of both of these men to identify the appellant’s photograph from the array presented to them. These circumstances favoured the appellant, by suggesting that she was not the woman they had seen, or, at least, that the jury ought to experience a reasonable doubt about whether she was. But the direction given to the jury invited caution in the approach to the descriptive evidence. 
     
      
    61 It is correct, as counsel argued, that neither s116 nor s165 obliged the trial judge to give a direction to the jury to exercise caution in relation to the descriptive evidence. But neither is there anything that prevents a trial judge giving such a direction where it is appropriate to do so: see R v Rose [2002] NSWCCA 455; 55 NSWLR 701, per Wood CJ at CL and Howie J. It was perfectly appropriate, in this case, for the judge to draw to the jury’s attention any potential weaknesses in the descriptive evidence. Recognition of such weaknesses might explain to the jury the description of the woman as of middle-eastern rather than islander or Fijian appearance, and the failure of Mr Chand and Mr Deo to identify the appellant from the photographs. It has often been said that the requirements concerning directions to a jury are designed to ensure a fair trial to all parties. The task of judges in directing juries is to assist them to reach the correct verdict. Pointing out potential weaknesses in evidence that may appear to favour the defence, provided it is done with restraint, is a proper approach to that task. 
     
      
    62 While I accept that the direction had some potential to undermine the exculpatory capacity of the descriptive evidence, I do not see that it was in any way unfair to do so. I am unable to accept that including in the direction a reference to the descriptive evidence had any likelihood of weakening the impact of the warning given in respect of Mrs El-Sobky’s identification of the appellant. 
     
      
    63 I would reject that aspect of this ground that complains that, in respect of the descriptive evidence, warnings which should not have been given were given. 
     
      
    64 There is another aspect to this ground of appeal. It was submitted that the identification evidence direction required reference to a number of specified circumstances. These were said to be: 
     
      
       
        
        “- the direct and circumstantial evidence as to the general description of the woman who attacked Mrs El-Sobky; 
         
         
        - that the descriptive evidence was not of itself sufficient to convict the appellant; 
         
         
        - the failure of both Mr Chand and Mr Deo to recognise the appellant when shown her photograph amongst a number of others; 
         
         
        - that the evidence of what Mrs El-Sobky had initially said to police was, within s165, evidence which may have been unreliable both because it was identification evidence and hearsay evidence; 
         
         
        - inconsistencies in Mrs El-Sobky’s different versions of events.” 
        
       
      
    65 It may be that the directions given did not specifically incorporate all of these matters. However, I am satisfied that the directions given were adequate for the purposes of the case. All that was required was a direction that drew to the jury’s attention any weakness in Mrs El-Sobky’s initial identification of the appellant. This was done. The other evidence in the case, as I have already pointed out, was overwhelmingly in support of that initial recognition and identification. It was overwhelmingly in support of the appellant’s guilt. I would also reject this aspect of this ground of appeal. It follows that I would reject ground 1. I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      the application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    66 A sentencing hearing took place on 1 April 2005. By that time Hesham El-Sobky had entered a plea of guilty to the charge of having been an accessory after the fact of the armed robbery of his wife. The sentencing proceedings in relation to the appellant and Hesham El-Sobky took place together. Mrs El-Sobky gave evidence. Her evidence was primarily related to her husband’s proceedings. In particular, she gave evidence about her state of health. She said that she had arrived with her husband from Egypt in Australia in January 1987. Shortly after her arrival she had been involved in a motor vehicle accident in which she suffered fractures to two spinal discs and both ankles. As a result she was left in a state of disability. Subsequently, in December 2004, she suffered another back injury. This evidence was directed to demonstrating her dependence upon her husband. However, as will become apparent, it is relevant to one of the grounds upon which the application for leave to appeal against sentence was advanced. 
     
      
    67 The appellant was arrested on 4 February 2003, and was refused bail. On 11 June 2003 she was released on conditional bail. In May 2004 she was again arrested on unrelated matters and spent about a month in custody specifically in relation to those matters. She was again released on bail on 9 June 2004 and remained at liberty until 16 February, the date of the jury’s verdict. During the course of sentencing submissions, counsel who appeared for the appellant advised his Honour that the appellant had spent about four months in custody before being granted bail. At that time, it appears, precise information as to the period of time she had spent in custody was not available. His Honour appears to have indicated that he proposed to take the pre-sentence custody into account, because he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, I might be able to do it by reference to the papers. There’s bound to be the bail undertaking in the court papers, so I’ll know the date of charging from the charge sheet, and the date of release on bail. And that will come also from the – and I don’t have it – custodial record.” 
        
       
      
    68 The appellant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Nield DCJ had available to him a pre-sentence report, a report from a “Services and Programs Officer” of the Department of Corrective Services, and a report from a psychologist. All were dated March or April 2005. 
     
      
    69 From these reports Nield DCJ was given a picture of the appellant’s personal circumstances. She was, as has already been mentioned, born on 22 March 1983. She was therefore about two and a half months short of her twentieth birthday at the time of the offence. She had, considering her age, a significant criminal history which included many offences of dishonesty, two of common assault, and another of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In January 2002, in relation to one count of common assault and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, she was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, with the sentence suspended on her entering into a two-year bond pursuant to s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). In February 2002, in respect of an offence of larceny, she was subjected to a bond under s9 of the same Act, for twelve months. Accordingly, she was subject to both bonds at the time of the offence against Mrs El-Sobky. She was born of a Fijian mother and Australian father. Her parents separated while she was a small child, and her father subsequently remarried. For many years she had no contact with her mother. She lived with her father and stepmother for some time and was there well cared for. Notwithstanding that, and devoted care given to her by her stepmother, she began using drugs, beginning with cannabis and progressing to heroin, at about the age of 14. She became addicted to heroin. She gave up using the drug for about two years from 1999, but relapsed after the breakdown of a relationship. She worked as a prostitute for a time. She has attempted methadone rehabilitation but has not met with great success. She met Hesham El-Sobky (under his alias of Mark David) in 2001 at the time she was working as a prostitute and was drug dependent. She made a suicide attempt in late 2002. 
     
      
    70 The psychological report disclosed an unusual and concerning personality profile, combining a high level of dependency with symptoms consistent with paranoid personality disorder. This combination, the psychologist said, created “an uncomfortable construct and dynamic”. The psychologist wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Someone who has strong elements of dependent and paranoid behaviours would be in a constant state of conflict and fear about interpersonal relationships – wanting to trust and depend on others yet at the same time fearing they could be harmed or damaged in relationships.” 
        
       
      
    71 In her discussion with the psychologist, the appellant maintained her innocence of the charge. 
     
      
       
      the remarks on sentence 
       
      
    72 The appellant and Hesham El-Sobky were sentenced together. 
     
      
    73 Nield DCJ outlined the chronology relevant to the commission of the offence and also the chronology relevant to the charge against the appellant. This demonstrated that considerable delay had occurred before the trial was brought on. The appellant was arrested and charged on 4 February 2003, but was not brought to trial until 9 February 2005. The reason for the delay does not clearly emerge. Hesham El-Sobky entered a plea of guilty on 2 February 2005. Until then it was anticipated that both would enter pleas of not guilty. On 31 May 2004 the appellant applied for a separate trial, which was refused on 2 June. The joint trial was then fixed for 6 September 2004. However, three days before that, the trial date was vacated because of Hesham El-Sobky’s ill-health. The trial was re-fixed to commence on 7 February 2005. 
     
      
    74 Having recounted those chronologies, Nield DCJ observed that the offence was very serious, and was planned (as shown by the appellant’s possession of the knife). He did, however, also observe that the planning was “without sophistication”. He noted that at the time of the offence the appellant was on two forms of conditional liberty, and that the offence resulted in Mrs El-Sobky being injured and her property being stolen. His Honour then said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was committed upon a vulnerable victim, as, to the knowledge of Ms Collins, Mrs El-Sobky was disabled by her spinal injury and used her crutch to aid her walking.” 
        
       
       
      This observation gives rise to the principal basis of the application. 
       
      
    75 His Honour then referred to the subjective materials that had been placed before him and then turned his attention to s21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. He took into account, as aggravating factors: 
     
      
    (i) that the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty (s21A(2)(j));(ii) that the victim was vulnerable (s21A(2)(l)); and(iii) that the event was part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s21A(2)(n)). 
     
      
    76 He said that he took into account, as mitigating factors, those identified in s21A(3)(a) and (k). S21A(3)(a) requires to be taken into account as a mitigating factor the fact that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial. S21A(3)(k) relates to a plea of guilty. It is obvious that the reference to s21A(3)(k) is a mistake. It is not possible to determine if his Honour intended to take into account some other mitigating factor, although it is not easy to identify any that applies. He specifically referred to the need for the sentence to reflect principles of specific and general deterrence. His Honour then imposed the sentence I have already set out. He made no mention of the period of pre-trial custody. 
     
      
       
      the grounds of the application 
       
      
    77 On behalf of the appellant it was contended that two specific errors could be identified in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    78 The first concerned his Honour’s decision to take into account, as an aggravating factor within s21A(2)(l), that the offence was committed upon a vulnerable victim. This was, his Honour said, because the appellant knew that Mrs El-Sobky was disabled by spinal injury and used a crutch to aid her in walking. 
     
      
    79 It was argued that no evidence to this effect was before the court. The evidence given by Mrs El-Sobky in the sentencing proceedings was given in the proceedings relevant to her husband. During the course of that, in another context, his Honour made it clear that, although the proceedings were heard jointly, he regarded the evidence in each as entirely separate from the other. 
     
      
    80 There was, however, evidence in the trial from Mrs El-Sobky that her husband was her carer. And there was evidence from Detective Sergeant Harding, who saw Mrs El-Sobky at the Liverpool Police Station on the evening of 18 January, that she needed crutches to walk. There was also evidence that the contents of her handbag included taxi vouchers. These were in fact in evidence, although they have not been produced to this Court. 
     
      
    81 It may be that the observation, as expressed by his Honour, that the appellant knew that Mrs El-Sobky was disabled by spinal injury, was something of an overstatement. But it must have been obvious to the appellant that Mrs El-Sobky was disabled to the extent that she used a crutch to aid her walking. I do not think it was incorrect to say that the offence was committed upon a vulnerable victim; nor do I think it was incorrect to say that this was known to the appellant. The most that could be said to be incorrect in the observation is that the appellant knew that the cause of the disability was spinal injury. Even that, in the circumstances, is unlikely – his Honour was entitled also to take into account the relationship between Hesham El-Sobky and the appellant, and draw such inferences as seemed appropriate. 
     
      
    82 In my opinion this error has not been established. 
     
      
    83 The second ground on which the application is advanced concerns the appellant’s pre-trial custody. His Honour specified that the sentence was to commence on 16 February 2005, the date the appellant was taken into custody following conviction. There is no reference in the remarks on sentence to the period of pre-trial custody. In the ordinary course of events a sentence will either be reduced by a term equivalent to the amount of pre-trial custody, or made retrospective to incorporate that period of time. Neither was here done. I accept that this error has been demonstrated. Accordingly, the commencement date of the sentence should be adjusted so as to take account of that period. 
     
      
    84 I would otherwise grant leave to appeal against the sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    85 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
      
      
      (ii) leave granted to appeal against sentence; 
       
        
       
      (iii) appeal against sentence allowed to the extent only that the sentence of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years to commence on 16 February 2005 be set aside. The appellant be re-sentenced to a period of imprisonment for eight years, commencing on 8 October 2004 and expiring on 7 October 2012, with a non-parole period of five years, expiring on 7 October 2009.

      FACTS 
       
      The appellant had committed a number of indictable and summary offences to which he pleaded guilty and was determined to be eligible to participate in a Drug Court programme. “ 
      Initial sentences 
      ” for the offences were imposed by the Drug Court but were suspended so that the appellant could participate in the programme pursuant to the  
      Drug Court Act  
      1988 (NSW) (the  
      Drug Court Act 
      ). The programme was terminated on 31 August 2004 due to the appellant’s non-compliance with its conditions. 
       
       
      The appellant came before the Drug Court again for reconsideration of the “ 
      initial sentences 
      ” and the imposition of “ 
      final sentences 
      ”: s.12  
      Drug Court Act 
      . The appellant also came before the Drug Court for sentencing in respect of further offences that he had committed both during the programme and following its termination. 
       
       
      The appellant appealed against the severity of the final sentences pursuant to s.5AF of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act  
      1912 (NSW). He has separately appealed against the sentences imposed in respect of the further offences. The s.5AF appeal is on the grounds that: 
       
       
        
        1. The trial judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor that certain of the ‘break, enter and steal’ offences committed in a particular block of units involved a series of criminal acts and that  
        ""there [were] multiple victims across this range of offending"" 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in his treatment of the appellant's record in that he: 
         
         (a) had regard to the appellant's record of “ 
         prior like offences 
         ” when the appellant’s prior offences were of a dissimilar and less serious nature; and 
          
         (b) took into account the appellant’s prior convictions as an aggravating factor. 
         
        
       
       
       
       
      HELD per Beazley JA: 
       
      (i) The ‘break, enter and steal’ offences committed at a block of units did not involve “ 
      multiple victims 
      ” within the meaning of s.21A(2)(m) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 (NSW) as required to count as an aggravating factor. The multiplicity of victims and criminal acts was a feature of the multiplicity of offences, which is not an aggravating factor:  
      R v Tadrosse 
       [2005] NSWCCA 145 (followed) 
       
       
      (ii) The trial judge was entitled to take account of the appellant’s prior criminal record, particularly prior like offences, as a factor enhancing the seriousness of the offending. The appellant had no convictions for ‘break, enter and steal’ offences prior to the offences dealt with in accordance with the  
      Drug Court Act 
      . However the trial judge’s reference to “ 
      prior like offences 
      ” 
        
      as a factor increasing the seriousness of the offending was an accurate description if it was used in reference to those offences not subject to sentencing under the  
      Drug Court Act 
      . From the context that appears to have been the intended reference:  
      R v Ponfield 
       (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 (followed) 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) The list of potential aggravating factors in the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 (NSW) are subject to the rule of law: see s.21A(4). Prior convictions are not prima facie an aggravating factor unless other circumstances are satisfied. The prior convictions in this case did not heighten the significance of retribution, deterrence and the protection of society and therefore should not have been taken into account as an aggravating factor:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellant appeals against the severity of sentences imposed on him by the Drug Court of New South Wales (the Drug Court) on 8 March 2005 pursuant to s.12 of the Drug Court Act 1988 (NSW) (the Drug Court Act). The appeal is brought pursuant to s.5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The power of the Criminal Court of Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under that section is exercised by a single judge of the Court: s.5AF(3). 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 On 2 July 2003 the appellant was sentenced by Judge Milson in the Drug Court, exercising the jurisdiction of a District Court, for the indictable offence of ‘break, enter and steal’ contrary to the provisions of s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence of ‘break, enter and steal’ carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. At the same time, the appellant was sentenced by Judge Milson, exercising the jurisdiction of a Local Court, in relation to the following summary offences: ‘resist police’; ‘escape police’; ‘drive whilst disqualified’; ‘break, enter and steal’ and ‘malicious damage’.  
     
      
    3 The appellant had satisfied the requirements of s.5 of the Drug Court Act, including pleading guilty to the offences and was thus an ‘eligible person’ for the purposes of the Act. He had been referred to the Drug Court under s.6 of the Act and, pursuant to s.7, had been accepted into participation in a rehabilitation programme under the Act. When an eligible person is accepted into a programme, the person is then sentenced in accordance with the provisions of s.7. That section provides that the Drug Court deals with a person in relation to an offence by convicting the person and sentencing the person in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act): see s.7(2A). A sentence imposed under sub-s.2A is referred to as the ""initial sentence"": see definition provision in s.4. Section 7(3) then provides that the Drug Court must make an order suspending the execution of the sentence for the duration of the person's programme. An order made under this provision is called the person’s “suspension order”. 
     
      
    4 Judge Milson sentenced the appellant, by way of initial sentence, to a term of imprisonment of one year three weeks in respect of the indictable offence of ‘break, enter and steal’. His Honour took into account a period of pre-sentence custody of five months one week. His Honour sentenced the appellant to the same or shorter concurrent terms of imprisonment in respect of the remaining summary sentences. Those sentences were respectively: ‘resist police’ - seven days; ‘escape police’ - two months; ‘drive whilst disqualified’ - two months; ‘break, enter and steal’ - one year three weeks; ‘malicious damage’ - six months.  
     
      
    5 While the appellant was undertaking the programme, a number of further offences that he had committed prior to entering into the programme came to light. These offences were committed over a four-day period between 21 January and 24 January 2003 and comprised a series of seven ‘break, enter and steal’ offences committed in separate units in an uncompleted residential unit development. Each of the seven offences were charged on indictment and a further seven offences were listed on a Form 1 pursuant to s.33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    6 The appellant was sentenced in respect of these offences in the Drug Court by Judge Orchiston on 19 April 2004. Judge Orchiston imposed a sentence of four years imprisonment in respect of the break, enter and steal charge in respect of which the Form 1 offences were considered (the principal offence). The sentence was reduced to take account of the period of pre-sentence custody that the appellant had served. A term of imprisonment of 30 months was imposed in respect of each of the other six offences, to be served concurrently with the principal offence. All sentences were to be served concurrently with the initial sentences imposed by Judge Milson. The sentences, which were also initial sentences pursuant to s.7(2A) were then suspended pursuant to s.7(3) of the Drug Court Act. 
     
      
    7 On 31 August 2004, the appellant’s Drug Court programme was terminated due to his non-compliance with its conditions. The appellant was arrested on 6 November 2003 and remained in custody until he came before the Drug Court again on 8 March 2005 for sentencing pursuant to the provisions of s.12 of the Drug Court Act.  
     
      
    8 Section 12 provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “Imposition of final sentence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) On terminating a drug offender’s program, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offenders initial sentence. 
         
         
        (2) In reconsidering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) …  
         
        (b) … 
         
          
          (c) any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates, including time during which the person has undergone imprisonment: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) under the sentence, … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) After considering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by making an order setting aside the initial sentence and taking such action under Part 2 of the  
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
          as it could have taken for the offence to which the initial sentence related, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by making an order confirming the initial sentence 
          
         
         
        (4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence.” 
        
       
      
    9 On 8 March 2005 the appellant came before Senior Judge Dive in the Drug Court. Pursuant to the provisions of s.12(3)(a), the Court was required to set aside the initial sentences imposed on 2 July 2003 and 19 April 2004 and to determine the appellant’s final sentences in respect of those offences. For the purpose of understanding the sentences which were imposed and their relativity with the initial sentences, it is convenient to reproduce a table helpfully provided by counsel for the appellant setting out the offences, the initial sentence and final sentence (Tables 1 and 2). The column headed “S/I” indicates whether the offences were dealt with on indictment or summarily.

    10 In addition, the appellant was before the Court in respect of a further five indictable offences of ‘break, enter and steal’, four of which had been committed whilst he was on the programme and one which had been committed after its termination, together with two summary offences of ‘state false name’ and ‘resist police’. The appellant also requested the Court to take into account seven further offences by way of a Form 1, when sentencing in respect of the first of the individual ‘break, enter and steal’ offences. The sentences imposed in respect of these offences are set out below in Table 3.

    11 The combined effect of the sentences imposed by Senior Judge Dive by way of final sentence together with the further sentences referred to in Table 3 was that a total effective sentence of six and a half years with a non-parole period of five years from 22 September 2004 was imposed. Having regard to the fact that a period of pre-sentence custody of five months one week was taken into account, the real sentence imposed upon the appellant was three weeks short of seven years with a non-parole period of five and a half years.  
     
      
    12 The appellant appeals against the final sentences imposed in respect of the Drug Court matters (offences 1-13 in Tables 1 and 2 respectively). The appellant has separately appealed against the sentences imposed in respect of the further offences set out in Table 3. It was acknowledged by both the Crown and counsel for the appellant that that appeal must be determined subsequent to the determination of this appeal. 13 The final sentences imposed in respect of offences 1-13 in Tables 1 and 2 total three years four months with a non-parole period of two and a half years. In imposing the sentences, Senior Judge Dive allowed for a 25 per cent discount for the appellant's pleas of guilty. Accordingly, his Honour commenced with a starting point of four years five months with a non-parole period of three years four months. 
     
      
    14 In determining the sentences that ought to be imposed, Senior Judge Dive had regard to the purposes of sentencing: see s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; the aggravating and mitigating circumstances specified in s.21A of that Act; and the objective and subjective factors that affected the relative seriousness of the offences. His Honour found the following were aggravating factors: the offender's record of previous convictions; the damage done, especially to the block of home units; the fact that those offences were committed when the defendant was on conditional liberty on the Drug Court programme; that in relation to the block of units, a series of criminal acts were committed; and that there were multiple victims across this range of offences. His Honour referred to the matters that had been taken into account by the sentencing judge when imposing the initial sentences. In relation to the first set of offences (see Table 1), he noted the pleas of guilty, the appellant's criminal record (which revealed few offences of a like nature) and the aggravating circumstance in relation to offence number 1, namely, that it was committed only days after offence number 5 - another ‘break, enter and steal’ offence that was dealt with summarily. His Honour noted that Judge Milson, when sentencing in respect of the first group of offences (offences 1-6 in Table 1), had not taken into account any mitigating circumstances, leaving those for consideration at final sentence, should that come about. His Honour observed that Judge Milson had taken his approach prior to the decision of this Court in R v Rice (2004) 150 A Crim R 37; [2004] NSWCCA 384, where Smart AJ, at [103], stated that the subjective features of the offender were required to be taken into account at the stage of initial sentence.  
     
      
    15 His Honour then referred to the second group of offences (offences 7-13 in Table 2) in respect of which the appellant was sentenced by Judge Orchiston on 19 April 2004. His Honour recorded that most of those offences had involved breaking into a block of home units that were under construction and close to completion and that the appellant had stolen a large number of white goods from 12 different units in the complex. His Honour noted that a wedding ring had also been stolen and that had been treated by Judge Orchiston as an aggravating circumstance. He noted the further aggravating circumstances that had been taken into account by Judge Orchiston, namely the fact that these were multiple offences of ‘break, enter and steal’ committed at the same time, the appellant's record for dishonesty, the high degree of planning involved in relation to these offences, together with the significant amount of damage done to the units. His Honour further observed that Judge Orchiston had correctly taken into account, in the appellant’s favour, the fact that the offences could have been dealt with summarily: see R v Crombie [1999] NSWCA 297. 
     
      
    16 Senior Judge Dive also took into account the appellant's participation in the programme, the 31 days he had served on the programme and the 13 days he had been in custody under s.8A of the Drug Court Act. His Honour had regard to the time the appellant was on the programme (a period of 14 months), although he noted that he had not progressed beyond Phase 1. His Honour also noted that the appellant apparently had little time during that period when he was free of drug use. 
     
      
    17 His Honour then turned to the additional offences that were before the Court (offences numbered 14-20 in Table 3). As has already been indicated, this appeal is not concerned with those matters. Accordingly, his Honour's consideration of those offences needs to be put to one side for the purposes of this appeal.  
     
      
    18 Although his Honour had made reference to imposing ""final sentences"", which would seem to be a reference to re-sentencing under s.12 of the Drug Court Act, it is arguable that his Honour was referring to the non-Drug Court matters as well as the Drug Court matters. It will be important in due course to determine precisely what his Honour was doing at this point in his sentencing remarks because the appellant claims that his Honour erred in taking into account matters relating to the non-Drug Court offences as aggravating features. I will deal with this in considering each of the grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    19 His Honour then had regard to the objective and subjective considerations, including the appellant's long history of drug and alcohol abuse and a diagnosis of major depression. His Honour made reference to further personal circumstances and to the decision of the Court in R v Crombie to which I have already referred. He noted however, that the Crown had undoubtedly elected to proceed by way of indictment because of both the nature and repetition of the offences. His Honour then imposed the sentences that are set out in the Tables. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 The appellant appeals against the final sentences imposed by Senior Judge Dive in respect of the offences referred to in Tables 1 and 2 on two essential bases: the first relates to the manner in which his Honour had regard to certain aggravating circumstances; the second relates to the manner in which his Honour dealt with the prior record of offences. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: whether the trial judge correctly had regard to the aggravating factors referred to in s.2A(2)(m) 
       
      
    21 The appellant contends that his Honour erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor pursuant to s.21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that the offences of 21 January 2003 (offences 7-12 in Table 2) involved a series of criminal acts and that ""there [were] multiple victims across this range of offending"". 
     
      
    22 Section 21A(2)(m) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         ... 
        
       
       
        
        (m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts"" 
        
       
      
    23 Section 21A(2)(m) was considered by this Court in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 where Howie J (Grove and Hall JJ agreeing) said at [29]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""...the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(m) is concerned with the situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct. A charge of this nature will be frequently found in cases of fraud or dishonesty perpetrated against a single victim such as a charge of embezzlement or larceny as a servant. It is also common to charge multiple instances of supplying drugs over a lengthy period of time as one offence under s.25 of the 
         Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    24 In his Remarks on Sentence, Senior Judge Dive referred to the provisions of s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which specify the aggravating and mitigating factors that the Court is to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. His Honour then listed the aggravating factors that he found to be relevant in this case. Included in those factors was a finding by his Honour that ""… there was certainly a series of criminal acts involving the same block of units, and there are certainly multiple victims across this range of offending"". This finding echoes the words of s.21A(2)(m). 
     
      
    25 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge appears to have taken para (m) into account as an aggravating factor in his assessment of the penalties to be imposed with respect to the individual offences. This submission has to be understood in the context of the charges laid in this case. His Honour stated that he had to have regard to para (m) in relation to the offences committed at “the block of units"". However, the appellant was charged separately with the offence that related to the block of units. These were multiple offences, but there was not, in relation to each offence, multiple victims. Rather, there was an individual victim in relation to each specific offence. Likewise, each offence involved a ‘break, enter and steal’ from a particular property. There was a single criminal act in relation to each offence, and a single victim. The multiplicity of victims and criminal acts were a feature of the multiplicity of offences. 
     
      
    26 It follows that the trial judge erred in his application of s.21A(2)(m). Before determining whether this error will result in this Court re-sentencing the appellant it is appropriate to consider the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: treatment of the appellant’s prior criminal record 
       
      
    27 The appellant contended that the sentencing judge erred in his treatment of the appellant's record in that he: 
     
      
       
      (a) had regard to the appellant's record of prior like offences; and 
       
      (b) took into account the appellant’s prior convictions as an aggravating factor. 
       
       
      Ground 2(a): the sentencing judge erred in having regard to the appellant’s record of prior like offences 
       
      
    28 The appellant contends that his Honour's finding that he had a record of “prior like offences” was simply wrong. It was submitted that although he had an offence for ‘larceny’ in 1993 (a Children's Court matter) and a further offence of ‘larceny and receiving or disposing’ dealt with by the Local Court in 2002, these were not ""like offences"" to the ‘break, enter and steal’ offences with which he was charged on this occasion. 
     
      
    29 The context in which his Honour made the reference to the “prior like offences” appears from the following passages in the Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “When imposing these final sentences today, this Court has regard to the very purposes of sentencing as set out in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances set out in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the objective and subjective factors which affect the relative seriousness of the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        The aggravating factors are the offender’s record of previous convictions, the damage that was done especially to the block of home units, that the latter offences were committed when the defendant was on conditional liberty of a Drug Court programme, that in relation to the block of units, there was certainly a series of criminal acts involving the same block of units, and there are certainly multiple victims across this range of offending. 
        
       
       
        
        In mitigation, I note that there has been a plea of guilty and Mr McCabe is entitled to the full utilitarian value of that plea which I assess as being twenty five percent. Indeed, for the latter matters, there was no committal, the matters coming straight to the Drug Court and the plea being entered on the indictment being presented.  
        
       
       
        
        There are factors enhancing seriousness in accordance with  
        R v Ponfield & Ors 
         [1999] NSWCCA 435. Those are the conditional liberty aspect of being on a Drug Court programme, his record of prior like offences, the multiple counts and the matters taken into account on form 1, and the series of repeated entries into the block of units. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the matters dealt with previously by way of initial sentences, I have already noted the summations made by Senior Judge Milson and Judge Orchiston. I note that Judge Milson took into account the time served prior to the first sentence.”  
        
       
      
    30 In this passage, his Honour was dealing at different times with either the Table 1 and 2 offences, or the Table 3 offences, or sometimes with both. The reference to “final sentences” and “initial sentences” is clearly a reference to the Table 1 and 2 offences. The reference to the “latter offences” must be a reference to the Table 3 offences. When dealing with the aggravating and mitigating factors, it is apparent that his Honour was dealing with the entirety of the offences.  
     
      
    31 Likewise, it appears that when dealing with “factors enhancing seriousness” his Honour was again dealing with the entirety of the offences. Thus, the reference to being on conditional liberty whilst on the Drug Court Program can only be a reference to offences 14-18 in Table 3. That is also apparent from a like, but even more specific reference to this matter in the passage relating to “aggravating factors”.  However, the reference to the “repeated entries into the block of units” appears to be a reference to offences 7 to 12 in Table 2. Although it is possible that his Honour could have been referring to offences 14 and 15, that is not probable. A reference to “repeated entries” does not easily relate to entries into two units, particularly when there was a series of offending that did involve “repeated entries”. The reference to “multiple counts and the matters taken into account on form 1” would appear to relate to all of the offences.  
     
      
    32 That leaves the reference to “prior like offences”. This reference accurately describes the appellant’s offending if it relates to the earlier ‘break, enter and steal’ offences for which the appellant had been sentenced under the provisions of the Drug Court Act – that is, the Table 1 and 2 offences. Not only is the language accurate when used in that context, his Honour had previously used different language when dealing with the appellant’s criminal record. In that regard, when dealing with “aggravating factors” his Honour referred to the appellant’s “record of previous convictions”. It ought be accepted, therefore, that when his Honour used different language in referring to “prior like offences” he meant precisely what he said. In doing so, he must therefore have been referring to those factors that increased the seriousness of the later offending, that is the Table 3 offences. For that reason, I do not think that the appellant has established that his Honour erred in his reference to “prior like offences”.  
     
      
    33 There is, of course, another possibility and that is that by failing to keep distinct those factors that were relevant to the re-sentencing for the purposes of imposing final sentences and those that were relevant to the latter offences, his Honour applied all the factors that he took into account to all of the offences. If he did so, then he would have erred. However, that point was not argued and for the reasons otherwise given in relation to error and my opinion in relation to re-sentencing, such an argument would have no effect on the outcome of the appeal. 34 I should add that there is another response to the appellant’s contention on this issue. If Senior Judge Dive, in using the expression “prior like offences” did intend to refer to the appellant’s record prior to the matters for which he was before the court, then the appellant’s submission is correct in the sense that he had no prior convictions for ‘break, enter and steal’ offences contrary to the provisions of s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The earlier larceny and receiving offences were property offences involving dishonesty as were the ‘break, enter and steal’ offences but they were not of the same seriousness as those offences.  
     
      
    35 However, the relevant principle to be applied when considering whether there are factors that enhance the seriousness of an offence was stated in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, to which Senior Judge Dive referred on this issue. In that case, Grove J stated at [48]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s.112(1) of the 
         Crimes Act  
        as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. ... 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) the offender  
        has a prior record 
         particularly for like offences."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    36 The appellant in fact had a prior criminal history extending over a period of approximately ten years prior to the commission of the ‘break, enter and steal’ offences which first brought him to be dealt with under the Drug Court Act. However there were only two offences involving dishonesty. Otherwise, there were a series of driving offences, a ‘malicious damage’ offence, a number of ‘resist arrest’ and ‘resist officer in the execution of duty’ offences and an offence of ‘sexual intercourse without consent’ for which the appellant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. These are not “prior like offences”. However, his Honour was entitled to take his prior criminal record into account in relation to the Table 1 and 2 offences, although given its nature, it ought not to have been treated as significantly enhancing the seriousness of the offending for which he was being sentenced by way of final sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2(b): the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the appellant’s prior convictions as an aggravating factor 
       
      
    37 In his Remarks on Sentence the trial judge included as an aggravating factor the appellant's record of previous convictions. His Honour's finding was intended to reflect the specification in s.21A(2)(d) that the Court is to take into account as an aggravating factor the fact that ""the offender has a record of previous convictions"". 
     
      
    38 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his Honour erred in doing so because s.21A(4) specifically provides that the list of aggravating factors is subject to ""the rule of law"". In R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78 Grove J (James and Barr JJ agreeing) at [53] said in relation to s.21A(4): 
     
      
       
        
        “... it is unfortunate that the legislature has included ‘a record of previous convictions’ in the list of aggravating factors, because it invites, as appears to have happened here, overlooking the qualification in s 21A(4) that a court does not have regard to any such factor as specified if it is contrary to ‘rule of law’ to do so. ‘Rule of law’ is construed to include common law principles:  
        R v Johnson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 76. It is the common law that [a] prior conviction does not operate to aggravate an offence but may deprive an offender of leniency or indicate that it is appropriate to give more weight to factors such as retribution, deterrence or community protection:  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2) 
         1998 164 CLR 465;  
        R v Wickham 
         [2004] NSWCCA 193."" 
        
       
      
    39 Counsel for the appellant also referred to R v McQueeney [2005] NSWCCA 168 where Latham J (Grove and Howie JJ agreeing) said at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is therefore strictly incorrect for a sentencing Judge to refer to an offender's criminal history as an aggravating feature of the offence for the purposes of s.21A of the 
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    40 In Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 Gummow J said at [67] that whilst good character might operate in mitigation, the bad character of an offender did not aggravate the offence ""because a person is not to be punished or punished again for crimes other than that for which sentencing is passed"". 
     
      
    41 The Crown submitted that the appellant's criminal record was such that he had manifested ""a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law so that retribution, deterrence and the protection of society indicated that a more severe penalty was warranted"". It followed, on the Crown's submission, that the Court was entitled to take the appellant’s criminal record into account when imposing sentences for the offences for which he was then before the Court. It was submitted that the appellant's reliance upon the statement by Latham J in R v McQueeney was misguided in the sense that it failed to have regard to her Honour's further comments that the offender’s antecedent criminal history in that case ""considerably heightened the significance of retribution, deterrence and the protection of society in the formulation of an appropriate penalty"" (at [18]). 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, the sentencing judge failed to understand the manner in which an offender’s previous criminal history is relevant to the sentencing process. When dealing with this matter his Honour referred first to the purposes of sentencing set out in s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and then to the ""aggravating and mitigating circumstances set out in s.21A"". His Honour then listed the aggravating factors relating to the offender, including his record of previous convictions. His Honour did not at any stage refer to the provisions of sub-s.4 nor did he have regard to the statements of principle relating to the use to which prior criminal history may be put. It follows, in my opinion, that this ground of appeal has also been made out.  
     
      
       
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    43 As the appellant has established error, it is open to this Court to re-sentence the appellant. The Court will only do so if it considers that the sentence or sentences imposed were excessive. It remains open to the Court to confirm the sentence or sentences imposed notwithstanding that it has been established that the trial judge erred if the Court considers that the sentence imposed was not, in any event, excessive: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ss.5AA(4), 5AF; see R v Astill (1992) 64 A Crim R 148 at 303-4; R v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311 at [22]. 
     
      
    44 There are before the Court 13 offences for which the appellant has been sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of three years four months with a non-parole period of two and a half years. The 13 offences with which this appeal is concerned were serious offences and involved a number of aggravating features to which the Court is required to have regard: see s.24 of the Drug Court Act; s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Those aggravating features include: one offence of ‘break, enter and steal’ occurring while the occupant of the premises was asleep in bed; there was a considerable loss of property involved in each offence; each offence was accompanied by damage to the property; each offence was planned. 
     
      
    45 The appellant's prior criminal history does indicate that personal deterrence and the protection of society is a relevant consideration in the sentences that ought to have been imposed. Although the offences with which the Court is concerned occurred over a relatively short period of time (except for offences 3 and 4 in the Tables above) it demonstrates a period of what can only be called intense criminal activity. Further, the appellant’s criminal activity was not isolated to a particular area or a particular physical location. There was a considerable degree of planning involved at least in relation to the offences that were committed at the home unit block at Caringbah. In that case, the appellant had transported the goods in a large truck which was parked in an underground carpark. 
     
      
    46 The sentencing judge imposed concurrent sentences in respect of the 13 offences. In doing so, he did not give any express consideration to the question whether the sentences imposed ought to be served concurrently or whether there should be some accumulation of the sentences in part or in whole. In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at 624: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality."" 
        
       
      
    47 Their Honours further pointed out in Pearce that error might also be revealed in making sentences concurrent ""… in that to do so [there may be a failure] to take account of the differences in the conduct which were the subject of punishment on each count"". 
     
      
    48 The Crown submits, correctly in my opinion, that Senior Judge Dive failed to apply the principles in Pearce and in this sense fell into error. The point of the submission, however, there being no Crown appeal, was that the sentences imposed overall, even having regard to the principle totality, indicated that, if anything, the sentences imposed were inadequate. 
     
      
    49 In my opinion, the sentences imposed by his Honour were, at least, extremely lenient. They may well have been inadequate. This is so, even though it was relevant, as his Honour correctly acknowledged, to have regard to the fact that the charges could have been dealt with summarily, so as to attract a maximum sentence for each offence of ‘break, enter and steal’ of two years: see R v Crombie. No objection has been taken to the objective and subjective considerations to which his Honour had regard and to which this Court also must give due weight. 
     
      
    50 In all of the circumstances, I am of the opinion that although his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence reveal error in sentencing principle in the respects I have found, I am of the opinion that this Court should not re-sentence the appellant and his Honour's sentence should be confirmed. I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Confirm the sentences imposed on the appellant on 8 March 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Crown appeals the sentences imposed on the respondents pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Both respondents were sentenced with the benefit of a finding of past and prospective cooperation with the authorities in relation to the drug importation enterprise in which they were involved. The Crown submitted that in relevant respects both respondents failed to cooperate in accordance with the undertaking which they gave and a new sentence should be substituted for that which was imposed. 
     
      
    2 The respondents were convicted after pleading guilty to a charge contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), that between 1 January 2004 and 30 April 2004 they conspired with each other and others namely Thi Ming Dang, Van Det Nguyen, Thanh Thi Kim Phuong Vu, Lenhi Paek and Trevor Paul Holloway to import into Australia a traffickable quantity of heroin. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is imprisonment not exceeding 25 years and/or a fine not exceeding $550,000. 
     
      
    3 Both respondents gave an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) promising to provide future assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    4 The form of that undertaking was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I Cam Thi Vo, do hereby undertake to co-operate with law enforcement agencies, pursuant to section 21E Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and in particular to do the following things: 
        
       
       
        
        1. To give full and frank evidence for the Crown and in accordance with my statement dated 7 April 2005 which is attached and marked ‘A’ and any other statement to be given in furtherance of this undertaking, in any court proceedings, including confiscation proceedings, that the Crown may nominate, in respect of any person including: 
        
       
       
        
         Thi Ming Dang, Trevor Paul Holloway, Lenhi Paek, Van Det Nguyen, Tung Thanh Tran and Thi Thanh Kim Phuong Vu. 
        
       
       
        
        2. To provide to Detective Sergeant Joon Hong, or any other officer nominated by the South East Asian Crime Squad, State Crime Command, New South Wales Police Service, any further full and frank voluntary statement in writing regarding my knowledge of and participation in any matter relating to the charge for which I am being sentenced, reasonably required by the South East Asian Crime Squad, State Crime Command, New South Wales Police Service. 
        
       
       
        
        3. To confer with the South East Asian Crime Squad, State Crime Command, New South Wales Police, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and counsel briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, in relation to any court proceedings referred to above, and to provide upon request a supplementary voluntary statement(s) of any further evidence in relation to matters arising from any such conference.” 
        
       
      
    5 The undertaking of Tung Thanh Tran was in similar terms, except the name of Cam Thi Vo appeared in para 1 in place of his. Section 21E is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where a federal sentence, or a federal non-parole period, is reduced by the court imposing the sentence or fixing the non-parole period because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies in proceedings, including confiscation proceedings, relating to any offence, the court must: 
         
         
          
          (a) if the sentence imposed is reduced—specify that the sentence is being reduced for that reason and state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction; and 
           
          (b) if the non-parole period is reduced—specify that the non-parole period is being reduced for that reason and state what the period would have been but for that reduction. 
          
         
         
        (2) Where: 
         
         
          
          (a) a federal sentence is imposed or a federal non-parole period is fixed; and 
           
          (b) the sentence or non-parole period is reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies as described in subsection (1); and 
           
          (c) after sentence, the offender, without reasonable excuse, does not co-operate in accordance with the undertaking; 
          
         
        the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the offender is under sentence, if the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so, appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or of the non-parole period. 
         
         
        (3) Where an appeal is begun under this section against the inadequacy of a sentence, or of a non-parole period, that was reduced because of a person’s undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement agencies, the court hearing the appeal: 
         
         
          
          (a) if it is satisfied that the person has failed entirely to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking—must substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period the sentence, or non-parole period, that would have been imposed on, or fixed in respect of, the person but for that reduction; and 
           
          (b) if it is satisfied that the person has failed in part to co-operate in accordance with the undertaking—may substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non-parole period such a sentence, or such a non-parole period, not exceeding in length the sentence that could be imposed, or the non-parole period that could be fixed, under paragraph (a), as it thinks appropriate. 
          
         
         
        (4) In subsection (1): 
         
        confiscation proceedings 
         includes: 
         
         
          
          (a) proceedings for forfeiture orders, pecuniary penalty orders, literary proceeds orders and restraining orders under the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 
          ; and 
           
          (b) proceedings for forfeiture orders, pecuniary penalty orders and restraining orders under the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 
          ; and 
           
          (c) proceedings for restraining orders and pecuniary penalty orders under Part XIII of the  
          Customs Act 1901 
          .” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 The respondents were sentenced on 30 August 2005 as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Cam Thi Vo – nine years imprisonment to date from 30 April 2004 and to expire on 29 April 2013. A non-parole period of six years imprisonment was imposed to date from 30 April 2004 and to expire on 29 April 2010. The sentence was reduced from 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years on the basis of her cooperation with authorities. 
       
       
      (b) Tung Thanh Tran – six years imprisonment to date from 30 April 2004 and to expire on 29 April 2010. A non-parole period of two years and six months imprisonment was imposed to date from 30 April 2004 and to expire on 29 April 2006. The sentence was reduced from seven years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and three months on the basis of his cooperation with authorities. 
       
      
    7 Dang, Nguyen and Vu went to trial. Tran was called to give evidence on 14 November 2005 and Vo to give evidence on 23 November 2005.  
     
      
    8 When sentencing Vo and Tran the sentencing judge found that Vo was a principal, together with Nguyen, in the enterprise to import heroin from Vietnam into Australia. Tran, who is Vo’s partner, was described as an assistant to Vo and was found to have engaged in a degree of organisation and management. However, it was found that he acted on and conveyed instructions and did not play a role as a principal.  
     
      
    9 In relation to the three persons facing trial Nguyen was found to be a principal in the enterprise with Vo. Dang was found to have been used by Vo to recruit couriers to be involved in the enterprise. This included recruiting Vu and Holloway. Vu acted as a courier and recruiter. 
     
      
    10 The criminal enterprise was discovered following investigation by the South East Asian Crime Squad. The investigation was focused on the activities of Vo and Tran. Vo employed a number of people to recruit drug couriers on her behalf. These couriers would travel to Vietnam, usually in pairs, where they were put in contact with a source of heroin established by Vo and Nguyen. The couriers would then smuggle the goods into Australia concealed in various ways. 
     
      
    11 Holloway was one of the drug couriers recruited by Vo. During each trip made by Holloway he maintained communication by telephone with Vo and Tran. Vo travelled to Vietnam on a number of occasions. 
     
      
    12 The Crown case was substantially built out of evidence of conversations lawfully intercepted over the telephone. These conversations included Vo and Tran and others involved in the importation. During the conversations coded words were used in order to attempt to disguise the illegal nature of the activities. For example, heroin and its importation were described in terms such as “attending a wedding”, “returning with wedding present”, “pair of pants”, “rolls” and “motorbike.” 
     
      
    13 The sequence of events which gave rise to the particular charges was in summary that on Sunday 4 April 2004 Vo travelled to Vietnam. Prior to her departure she spoke to Paek, one of the co-offenders. Following her arrival in Vietnam there were a number of telephone calls between herself and Tran. Tran assumed the role of lieutenant during Vo’s absence from Australia and became the point of contact not only for Vo, but for others who were a party to the conspiracy. 
     
      
    14 On 6 April 2004 there was a telephone conversation between Tran and Paek which referred to an importation which was to have occurred some days earlier. There was a reference in that conversation to Nguyen and his annoyance at the change of plans. This conversation also included a reference to the particular means which would be used for the next importation namely a blue/green bag and a rice-cooker. The rice-cooker was to contain “whole fish” referring to a quantity of heroin to be imported. 
     
      
    15 On Friday 9 April 2004 Holloway returned to Sydney from Vietnam. He was carrying a rice-cooker in a large blue nylon carry bag. His luggage, including the rice-cooker, was subjected to a full examination by Customs officers upon arrival. An x-ray inspection of the rice-cooker showed an object wrapped around the inside liner of the cooker. Prising the rice-cooker open the officers found the insulation lining intact. As a result Holloway was allowed to leave the airport with his luggage including the rice-cooker. 
     
      
    16 Nguyen and Paek were waiting at the airport. Holloway was followed from the airport to the home of Vo and Tran. He was still in possession of the bag containing the rice-cooker. Shortly after arriving at that address there was a telephone call between Tran and Paek in which Tran said “they’re back from the wedding can you come over to my place right away to get the gift.” Arrangements were made for Paek to attend. There was then a series of telephone conversations between Tran and Paek as to why it was taking so long. During those conversations Nguyen could be heard in the background giving instructions. Ultimately Tran told Paek to meet him in Chipping Norton and he gave her the relevant directions. Tran said “you can make your way there and I will carry it with me.” This was a reference to the rice-cooker. 
     
      
    17 Tran left his house with Holloway and received a telephone call from Paek saying they had arrived in the park and further directions were given to arrange the meeting. Nguyen and Paek left the park and were followed to Liverpool. The large blue nylon carry bag containing the rice-cooker was located by the police in the back of their vehicle. It bore the airline tag “Trevor Holloway.” 
     
      
    18 An examination of the cooker revealed there were four blocks of heroin located inside with a gross weight of 750 grams. These blocks were taped inside the lining of the rice cooker in the same position as the insulation which had been revealed by the x-ray by Customs officers. A subsequent analysis of the drug found it to be 678.4 grams of heroin with a purity of 75%. The estimated street value of the drug was $750,000. 
     
      
    19 On Sunday 11 April 2004 Vo returned to Sydney from Vietnam. On the following days there were a number of conversations between Vo and Vu in relation to organising couriers for future importations. There were also conversations between Vo and Tran relating to whether Nguyen and Paek had been arrested. Again these conversations were in code. 
     
      
    20 On Wednesday 21 April 2004 Holloway again travelled from Australia to Vietnam. Vo instructed a female in Vietnam to collect him. There were a number of conversations between Tran and Vo in relation to the arrangements in Vietnam. If the earlier importation was successful Vu was to bring to Australia a second rice-cooker containing heroin. On Monday 30 April 2004 Vo and Tran were arrested. 
     
      
    21 The respondents were sentenced at the same time. The present relevance of the remarks on sentence is confined to the question of assistance to the authorities. In this respect the sentencing judge said that assistance to the authorities was a matter of “some substance in all of the cases” before him. In relation to Vo his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has agreed to give evidence at the trial of the co-accused, which is still to take place, who have pleaded not guilty. She has, after some initial resistance, been of substantial assistance to the police, in the course of which she has made a number of frank disclosures about the level of her own involvement and the involvement of others in this enterprise, far more frank than she has been about her personal problems, which are in such acute need of attention. 
        
       
       
        
        Detective Senior Constable Hong from the South East Asian Crime Squad, who has had a significant role in the investigation of this offence, gave evidence that she will be of great assistance to the prosecution at the trial of the co-accused. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no doubt – and I will come back to this in the context of protective custody - she has placed herself at risk because of the degree to which she has ultimately been prepared to cooperate. In those circumstances, while it is also noted that the investigation was substantially completed before her offer of assistance was forthcoming and therefore she has not, for example, contributed to the apprehension of any other person who was not already well under investigation by the police, substantial effect should be given to the assistance which she has provided to the investigating authorities. The appropriate effect is the subject of the observations of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Cartwright  
        (1989) 70 NSWLR 149, a case to which I have given due regard on this aspect of the matter.” 
        
       
      
    22 Ultimately his Honour said in relation to Vo: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as assistance is concerned, I accept what Detective Hong has said. He did value the assistance offered by Ms Vo as of some substance. However, I think there is reason to believe on all of the evidence before me that consistent with much of the history of this case she might not have been as comprehensively forthcoming as she could have been, but nonetheless the assistance was of substance, and therefore that should be reflected in a further reduction of a percentage in the vicinity of 25%.” 
        
       
      
    23 In relation to Tran the sentencing judge determined that a discount of 20% should be allowed for the assistance “which was offered.” His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question of the extent of assistance which Mr Tran offers remains a somewhat controversial one on the evidence. I acknowledge that on his part Detective Hong was not particularly impressed with the assistance he obtained from Mr Tran in comparison to that from Ms Vo. However, my own understanding of the history of the matter and of Detective Hong’s own evidence, particularly under cross-examination, would suggest that he was somewhat overly unsympathetic to Mr Tran in comparison to Ms Vo, and that while I accept that in the case of both of these offenders they were not as helpful to the police as they might have been – and I say that in comparison to Mr Holloway, who I will come to in due course – that, nonetheless, assistance offered by Mr Tran, while to some extent compromised, was nonetheless real and it was certainly genuine, and in those circumstances a reduction of 20% against the sentence otherwise appropriate will be applied.” 
        
       
      
    24 Both Vo and Tran gave evidence at the trials of the other offenders. However, their evidence was quite unsatisfactory. At the outset of her evidence Vo gave a speech to the Court which included exculpatory matter in relation to all three of the accused then on trial. She repeated that assertion throughout her evidence. In this respect her evidence was contrary to the witness statement attached to her s 21E undertaking. It was also contrary to the objective evidence tendered at the trial which was available from the telephone intercepts and surveillance material. 
     
      
    25 At the trial of the other offenders the judge concluded that Vo was an unfavourable witness pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Although she continued to answer questions she suggested that in many respects matters in her original statement were false in so far as the three accused may have been involved in the criminal enterprise. When asked about the true meaning of the telephone calls Vo on occasions claimed she did not remember what was meant by the conversation and denied the meaning suggested to her by counsel. 
     
      
    26 Vo gave evidence that she had not read her statement in its entirety before signing it. She also claimed that she had given a false statement implicating others simply to obtain a reduced sentence. The trial judge criticised Vo during the course of her giving evidence and had occasion to point out to her the difficulties which she faced if she failed to give truthful evidence. Although she was offered the opportunity of seeking legal advice she declined to do so.  
     
      
    27 A perusal of Tran’s evidence reveals a number of problems. Although he had pleaded guilty to the offence he claimed that he did not know that there were drugs in the rice-cooker. He also sought to down-play Vu’s role in the enterprise. The trial judge found that he was an “unfavourable witness” pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Although like Vo he continued to answer questions his evidence was unsatisfactory and he appeared to avoid answering any question that would implicate the accused Van Det Nguyen. Many of the answers which he gave were in direct contradiction with the statement which he had provided and which was annexed to his s 21E undertaking. His answers are also inconsistent with the objective evidence. 
     
      
    28 When sentencing the other offenders the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tran, Holloway and Cam Vo offered to assist the police and each gave a number of statements about their involvement and the involvement of the others in the conspiracy. Paek (who had also pleaded guilty) gave no assistance. 
        
       
       
        
        Holloway kept to his agreement and gave evidence implicating Phuong Vu, but could give no evidence of the involvement of Nguyen and Dang as he had nothing to do with the arrangements with either of them, apart from delivering the rice-cooker to Nguyen in the park. 
        
       
       
        
        Cam Vo and Stephen Tran gave evidence at the trial, which contradicts the statements they had made implicating the three accused. They each attempted to give evidence exculpating Nguyen and Dang. I gave leave to the Crown to cross-examine each of them on their prior inconsistent statements, and generally. Each of them told lies, sometimes contradicting versions earlier given. Cam Vo, in particular, told lies and acted in a contemptuous manner in the court.  
        
       
       
        
        The trial was a difficult one, since it involved playing many hours of intercepted telephone calls, most of which were in the Vietnamese language, and then the cross-examination of Tran, Vo and Holloway about those calls. In each of the calls, code words were used to describe heroin. For example, heroin was described as ‘wedding cakes.’ ‘motorbikes’, ‘trousers’, ‘pockets.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Each of the offenders adopted different tactics at the trial. Van Det Nguyen’s case was that he was not the man, An Bha who was with Lenhi Paek, when she met Stephen Tran and Cam Vo and that reference to An Bha by any person in the telephone intercepts was not a reference to him. His case on this point was put by way of cross-examination of Cam Vo and Stephen Tran and to some extent, by cross-examination of Mai Loc Dang. He did not give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Cam Vo tried very hard to assist Van Det Nguyen and frequently claimed that An Bha was another man altogether. The jury, by its verdict rejected this claim. In my opinion, the jury rightfully convicted Van Det Nguyen. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender, Mai Loc Dang, by her cross-examination of Cam Vo and Stephen Tran and by her own evidence, put forward a claim that she was not engaged in arranging for women to go to Vietnam to put heroin in their vaginas and bring it back to Australia; rather, she was arranging for women to go to Vietnam to put credit cards in a particular bank machine in Saigon for the purpose of getting money out of it. One of her claims was that a credit card, which had no more credit available in Australia, could be used to get money from this bank in Saigon. Her story made very little sense. It was impossible to understand, with the expense of sending someone to Vietnam by aeroplane, how any money could be made by taking a credit card to Vietnam, which had been used to its limit. After all, the holder of the credit card would still have a debt to the bank. 
        
       
       
        
        Both she and Cam Vo falsely claimed that references in the telephone intercepts to ‘pockets’, ‘trousers’ and ‘credit cards’ were not references to heroin, but references to sewing and to the credit card scheme. The jury by its verdict rejected this false version and correctly convicted the offender. She has maintained this false version in what she has said to a probation and parole officer since the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        Phuong Vu gave no evidence and essentially relied on cross-examination. I found it difficult to see what her case was, since she frequently was recorded in the intercepted conversations, talking to Cam Vo and discussing what she was going to do. 
        
       
       
        
        Essentially, she sought to join in the case of Mai Loc Dang and assert that she, like Mai Loc Dang was involved in a credit card scheme and that she went to Vietnam, only for the purpose of obtaining cash from this particular bank ATM. Mai Loc Dang was a disastrous witness, an obvious liar.” 
        
       
      
    29 Both respondents conceded that the evidence which they gave was unsatisfactory and failed, at least in part, to honour the undertaking which they had given. Accordingly, this Court must intervene and resentence. 
     
      
    30 However, the respondents submitted that although the evidence of the respondents may have been unsatisfactory they nevertheless gave evidence which would have been of some assistance to the Crown in proving its case. I do not accept this submission. Although it is true that the respondents gave evidence, and at some length, the evidence was so unsatisfactory that the jury must have found it unreliable. This was the position taken by the Crown Prosecutor in final address. In my opinion it is most likely that the guilty verdicts were obtained having regard to the objective material, including the respondents’ statements, and that the oral evidence of the respondents at the trial was of no assistance. Accordingly, in my view although allowance should be made for the assistance which had been given before sentencing any allowance for the assistance thereafter should be wholly disregarded and the respondents resentenced accordingly. 
     
      
    31 In that respect s 21E provides for the circumstances where there has been an entire failure to cooperate, s 21E(3)(a), or a part failure s 21E(3)(b). In my opinion the appropriate finding in respect of both respondents is one of an entire failure to cooperate in accordance with their undertakings.  
     
      
    32 When sentencing the judge was required to specify that the sentence was being reduced because the offender had undertaken to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction. The same statement of reasons was required in relation to the reduction in the non-parole period: (s 21E(1); R v Hodgson (2002) 135 A Crim R 92).  
     
      
    33 In the present case, the process followed by the sentencing judge was not faithful to the section. Rather than identify the reduction provided in relation to the undertaking to cooperate his Honour provided a reduction which reflected both past cooperation and prospective future cooperation. 
     
      
    34 At the conclusion of his remarks on sentence his Honour was reminded of the need to quantify the reductions having regard to s 21E. Although his Honour took a short adjournment to consider the matter, when he resumed his remarks on sentence he failed to state the reduction which he was providing by reason of the undertaking to cooperate. 
     
      
    35 His Honour should not be criticised for this oversight. There are many demands upon the time of a District Court judge who is required to deal with many problems during the course of a busy list which may include multiple matters for sentence. The obligation of ensuring that a sentencing judge is aware of and provides remarks on sentence which respond appropriately to the complexities of the sentencing legislation falls significantly on the prosecutor. That obligation was not discharged in this case. 
     
      
    36 Provision is made for reductions in sentence when assistance is offered to the authorities by a person under both state and Commonwealth legislation. The Commonwealth Crimes Act provides in s 16A(2)(h) that when sentencing a court must take into account “the degree to which the person has cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or offences.” This may conveniently be described as “past cooperation.” Section 21E provides for the court to reduce the sentence where an offender has undertaken to cooperate with law enforcement agencies usually by giving evidence against another accused although there may be other cooperation which is offered. This may conveniently be described as “prospective cooperation.” 
     
      
    37 The two bases for a discount in sentence are distinct and should not be confused: Bogdan Tomasz Gladkowski (2000) 115 A Crim R 446. This is important, if for no other reason than to ensure that if the promised cooperation is not forthcoming the Court of Criminal Appeal is able to identify the component of the sentence which may require to be substituted by another sentence pursuant to s 21E(3)(a) or (b). 
     
      
    38 The purpose of s 21E(3)(a) or (b) is not to punish the offender for failing to cooperate but rather to restore the sentence which would have been imposed if the offer of cooperation had not been made. If a person has failed entirely to cooperate the appeal court must restore the original sentence. If the failure is as to part the court has a discretion. However, that discretion is confined so that the court may not impose an additional sentence which exceeds the maximum by which the original sentence was reduced. In my opinion the additional sentence should so far as the appeal court is able reflect an increase in the sentence which reflects the extent to which the offered cooperation has not been forthcoming. 
     
      
    39 I am satisfied that when sentencing both respondents his Honour determined that their cooperation with the authorities before sentencing was significant. Although the evidence which they ultimately gave was effectively worthless, their presentencing cooperation enabled the Crown to obtain statements which were ultimately tendered at the trial. These statements were of value, both in explaining the involvement of other offenders and in providing confirmation of the code used in communication. 
     
      
    40 The sentencing judge used varying expressions when describing the cooperation of Vo. At one point he described her cooperation as “having been of substantial assistance to the police” and refers to her “frank disclosures.” His Honour also found that Det Snr Const Hong gave evidence that “she will be of great assistance to the prosecution of the trial for the co-accused.” As it happens the anticipated form of that assistance did not materialise, although the statement made before sentencing was of real value and was tendered at the trial. 
     
      
    41 At a later point in his remarks, his Honour accepted that Det Hong valued the assistance offered by Vo “as of some substance.” He repeats that the assistance was “of substance” and determines a reduction of 25%. 
     
      
    42 In relation to Tran his Honour appears to have been less inclined to accept the assessment of Det Hong. His Honour found that the assistance offered by Tran “while to some extent compromised was nonetheless real and it was certainly genuine.” 
     
      
    43 In these circumstances it falls to this Court to consider the percentage which his Honour attributed to past assistance and identify the percentage his Honour allowed for prospective cooperation. This is not a task which may be carried out with mathematical precision. However, it seems to me that the prospective cooperation offered by each of them must have been the same ie to give evidence consistent with their statement at the trial. Having regard to the fact that the statements had already been made I am satisfied that the allowance for prospective cooperation which his Honour provided should be assessed to be 10% in each case. 
     
      
    44 Accordingly, in my opinion the following orders and sentences should be imposed. 
     
      
       
      In relation to Vo: 
       
       
      1. The Crown appeal is upheld and the sentence quashed. 
       
      2. In lieu of the sentence imposed the respondent should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years to date from 30 April 2004 and to expire on 29 April 2014.  
       
      3. Set a non-parole period of six years and six months from commencement of the sentence to expire on 29 October 2010. 
       
       
      In relation to Tran: 
       
       
      1. The Crown appeal is upheld and the sentence quashed. 
       
      2. The respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and eight months from 30 April 2004 to expire on 29 December 2010. 
       
      3. Set a non-parole period of two years and ten months from the date of commencement of the sentence to expire on 1 March 2007.

     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J.HISLOP J: 
     
      
      Introduction 
      
    2 On 6 February 2006 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 7 June 2005 he did break and enter a dwelling house and commit therein a serious indictable offence namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 112(1). The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment.3 On 16 February 2006 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court for that offence to a term of imprisonment which consisted of a non parole period of 18 months with a total term of 2 years which was to date from 5 September 2005 with the applicant to be released on parole on 4 March 2007.4 The victim of the offence was a young woman. She had been a friend of the applicant. She had agreed that the applicant could stay at her home from 4 June 2005 pending a Court hearing on 6 June 2005. The Court hearing was adjourned on 6 June 2005 and the applicant returned to the victim’s home that day. He became intoxicated. The victim asked him to leave. He did so on the following day. Shortly before 10.30pm on 7 June 2005 the applicant returned to the victim’s home. The victim was in the house with a 16 year old female neighbour. They refused to open the door when the applicant knocked. What then happened was described by the sentencing Judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The (applicant) was heard to bang on the door and yelled out “Let me in or I’ll kill you”. 
         
        (The victim) had a short conversation through the closed door and agreed to place (the applicant’s) personal belongings out at the front door, which she did. (The applicant) then forced open the front door causing the locking device to break from the door jamb and the glass door panel to crack. He then entered the lounge room. 
         
        (The victim), by this stage, had contacted the police. (The applicant) knocked the phone from her hands before hitting her to the left side of the face. The young neighbour has run into the bathroom in an attempt to escape but without success. The (applicant) has then grabbed (the victim) thrown her from side to side and he has bitten her on the face around her mouth. She attempted to pull away but he refused to let go. Her nose and her face have bled. She was screaming. A neighbour heard screams, entered the flat and the (applicant) left. 
         
        I have heard a tape which was activated at the 000 number after her call and it reveals a very frightening scenario. 
         
        She received a small cut to the base of her nose along with a bite mark above her top lip and soreness to the left side of her body. She is, I am told, still in fear of him. 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The proposed grounds of appeal, which are set out in the applicant’s written submissions and argued on the application were: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the effect of cumulation in determining the non parole period; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant’s mental illness; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
     
     
      
      Subjective factors 
      
    6 The applicant was born on 28 July 1973. His criminal record comprised a large number of driving offences including three PCA’s, custody of a knife in a public place (x2), possessing an offensive weapon, destroying or damaging property (x4), possess stolen property (x2), offensive language, resist or hinder police officer in execution of duty, assault (x2), intimidate witnesses, contravention of an AVO and assault police officers in the execution of their duty.7 The applicant was on bail and on a bond at the time of the subject offence. He was arrested and taken into custody on 8 June 2005. He has remained in custody since that date, initially serving a 3 month gaol sentence for unrelated offences and, since 5 September 2005, in respect of the subject offence.8 The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. There was tendered on his behalf the report of a psychiatrist, Dr Lucas, dated 11 June 2002. Dr Lucas had examined the applicant in 1999. On that occasion he obtained a history that the applicant had a problem with alcohol and was a regular user of cannabis. He considered the plaintiff was a somewhat unusual man but there were no clear signs of psychosis. 9 Following his examination on 14 May 2002 Dr Lucas wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        He has abused amphetamines and developed a severe psychotic illness.  
        
       
        
       
        
        [He was] clearly psychotic, delusional and with elevated mood and pressure of speech. 
         
        … 
         
        Dr Lean and I agreed that Mr Turner is suffering from a quite severe psychosis. It is not clear whether he is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia or from a bipolar disorder or perhaps schizo-affective disorder. I believe that time, further observation and monitoring of his response to treatment will clarify diagnosis. 
         
        … 
         
        His history of substance abuse is of considerable concern when contemplating his future – it could precipitate or exacerbate psychotic symptoms or interfere with his treatment or compliance with it. 
        
       
      
    10 Dr Lucas recorded in his report that since the applicant’s consultation with him his medication had been altered and his mental state had improved remarkably.11 Also tendered were discharge summaries from the Chisholm Ross Centre, the acute psychiatric unit of Goulburn Base Hospital. The copies of these documents are difficult to read but it seems the applicant was admitted to the centre in April 2004 with a diagnosis of substance abuse disorder. Psychotic illness. He was discharged on 4 April 2004. The summary records “It remains unclear if he has an underlying mental illness and/or personality disorder.”12 He was again admitted to that centre on 16 May 2004 and discharged on 17 May 2004. The diagnosis was alcohol abuse. He was scheduled after reportedly trashing someone’s flat. A long history of alcohol and illicit drug use was noted. He has been described as bizarre and psychotic at times. The applicant was thought disordered and delusional and was transferred to Canberra Hospital. 13 The applicant was readmitted to the centre on 14 May 2005 intoxicated, aggressive and had injured himself falling onto a glass coffee table. He was reported to be irrational. He was discharged on 17 May 2005.14 No up to date psychiatric report was tendered. Unsuccessful efforts had been made to obtain such a report for the sentencing hearing. The applicant elected to proceed in the absence of such a report. 15 There was evidence in a statement of the victim that the applicant constantly talked to himself and talked strange, and from a neighbour of the victim that on 4 June 2005 the applicant seemed to be talking in riddles and didn’t make too much sense.16 Reliance was also placed upon a letter from the applicant’s mother which noted that since the applicant had been in the correctional centre: 
     
      
       
        
        The change (for the better) had been nothing short of a miracle. 
        
       
      
    The applicant’s mother and step father were each prepared to have the applicant live with them. 17 His Honour found the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was entitled to a 25% discount on sentence. 
     
      
      Ground One – The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the effect of cumulation in determining the non parole period. 
      
    18 On 19 September 2005 the applicant was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 3 months expiring on 5 September 2005. His Honour had regard to that fact in commencing the sentence for the subject offence on 5 September 2005.19 It was submitted for the applicant that his Honour should have found the resultant cumulation of the sentence amounted to special circumstances which should have been taken into account by him in adjusting the non parole period on the sentence for the subject offence and that his Honour’s failure to refer to the effect of cumulation suggests it was overlooked by his Honour.20 I do not agree. His Honour was well aware that the sentence for the subject offence was to commence immediately following the expiration of the previous non parole period. The finding of special circumstances is discretionary. The other offences were totally distinct and separate. The non parole period for the earlier offences had expired when his Honour came to sentence. His Honour considered the question of special circumstances. He held there were none. In my opinion no error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
     
     
      
      Ground Two – The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant’s mental illness. 
      
    21 His Honour accepted the applicant suffered from a mental illness.22 The applicant submitted his Honour “…failed to give any proper consideration as to how (the mental illness) was relevant to the instant sentencing exercise”. In particular it was submitted his Honour did not consider whether the illness affected the applicant’s culpability or the weight to be given to general and specific deterrence or whether it may affect him during his incarceration.23 However the medical evidence of Dr Lucas did not go beyond establishing that the applicant was suffering from a psychosis in 2002 which responded to drug treatment. The later evidence from the Chisholm Centre was suggestive that the condition may have been alcohol induced or exacerbated. There was no up to date psychiatric evidence that established the contribution the mental illness made to the commission of this offence or otherwise permitted of a close analysis of the effect of the psychiatric condition.24 His Honour’s remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore. He regarded the offence as a very serious one and one where he was inclined to impose a much higher sentence than that which he ultimately did. 25 However his Honour was persuaded by the address of counsel for the applicant to have significant regard to the applicant’s mental illness. His Honour acknowledged in exchanges with counsel the principle that a mental condition may impact upon general and specific deterrence. He accepted the mental problems may very well effect the applicant’s response to situations such as occurred. He also had regard to the countervailing danger presented to the community by the applicant. His Honour considered those matters and took them into account in reducing the sentence to a much lower level than that which he would otherwise have imposed.26 The submission that incarceration may have an adverse impact on the applicant by reason of his mental illness was based upon a history give to Dr Lucas of difficulties encountered by the applicant in the Goulburn Correctional Centre some years before. No evidence was presented that the applicant had encountered any similar problems in respect of his imprisonment following the subject offence. No submission in this regard was made at the sentencing hearing. Indeed the inference from the evidence of his mother was to the contrary.27 In my opinion error has not been demonstrated in respect of this ground of appeal. 
     
      
      Ground Three – The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
      
    28 It was submitted that the sentence and in particular the non parole period were manifestly excessive. It was submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        That there were significant factors going to the issue of special circumstances in addition to the issue of cumulation. They include the fact that it is the applicant’s first substantial sentence of imprisonment, the applicant’s mental illness and the need for rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    29 In my opinion it has not been demonstrated that the sentence is manifestly excessive. The sentence is not such as would lead me to conclude some other, more lenient, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
      Orders 
      
    30 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
         
         
        (2) Appeal dismissed.

     CONRAD PENGILLEY v R 
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCOLL JA: The appellant Conrad Eugene Pengilley was convicted by a jury in the District Court of New South Wales of maliciously wounding Adrian Pira contrary to s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.2 He seeks to challenge his conviction on the basis that the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to the meaning of “maliciously” by failing to explain the concept of recklessness. 
     
      
      Circumstances of the case 
      
    3 The Crown’s case at trial was, in short, that the appellant had maliciously wounded the victim, Adrian Pira, by smashing a beer glass into his face, near his eye, at the Royal Hotel at Queanbeyan on the evening of 6 February 2003.4 On that evening the victim went to the Hotel with two friends, Mark Tierney and Sue Byrne at about 9.30 pm. They were sitting at a table having drinks when a man in a white shirt approached the victim, pushed him to one side, then asked Ms Byrne for a game of pool. The victim fell back, got up and asked the man why he could not have gone around him. The man then spoke aggressively to the victim, but returned to his table near the pool table. He continued to abuse the victim however, including calling him a “little black prick”. 5 There were two other people at the table with the man wearing the white shirt, one wearing a blue shirt and denim pants who, on the Crown’s case, (not now disputed) was the appellant. After the abuse had continued for a couple of minutes, the victim got off his chair and walked towards the group. He asked the man in the white shirt “what his problem was” and he said “no problem”. (T 35). The victim’s voice was raised during this exchange. 6 After the man in the white shirt said “no problem”, according to the victim he got up off his chair, pushed the victim away and then: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I hit him, he hit me and punch was going on, punch for punch and next minute I just felt a glass in my eye. I mean I couldn’t see or anything … I just – the glass was put in my eye at the same time I was arguing with the guy in the white… “. (T 39). 
        
       
      
    7 The victim was taken to hospital by his friends and received about sixty stitches to his facial injuries.8 Mr Plummer, the hotel publican, gave evidence that he saw the man in the white shirt having a scuffle with the victim and that, as he approached them, the man in the blue shirt on the other side of the table picked up a schooner glass and hit the victim in the left forehead with a “full swing of a punch”. He observed the glass shatter on impact and saw the victim grab hold of his face. Mr Plummer had not had anything to drink that evening, he being a teetotaller.9 Another witness, Patrick Monsall, heard the abusive exchange between the man wearing the white shirt (to whom he had been introduced and who he knew as Matt) and the victim. He had also been introduced to the appellant who had been identified as Matt’s brother. As Mr Monsall was playing a pool shot, he heard the crashing of glass and a few loud words and looked up to see Matt punching the victim and: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [the appellant] actually just got back from the bar with a full schooner of beer and he’s launched over the table and struck Adrian in the face with a full schooner of beer.” (T 73). 
        
       
      
    10 Mr Tierney also observed the fight breaking out and said he saw the victim get hit with a glass by “the guy in the blue shirt with the white stripes.”11 Ms Byrne did not see how the victim suffered his injuries.12 The appellant admitted hitting the victim with a glass but said in an ERISP interview conducted on the evening of 6 February 2003, that he had acted in self-defence of his brother. The ERISP recorded the following exchanges: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q 38 What’s happened when you’ve put your hand out in front of him? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Well, obviously he’s run into my hand and while this has happened other people have, like, jumped on me from behind… 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 39 What was in your hand? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A I was drinkin’ my beer at the time, I think I was havin’ a cigarette, drinkin’ a beer. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 41 Which hand was the beer in? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Right hand. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 43 Did the, did the beer glass hit the person? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Well, I imagine it did. I mean, you know, it all happened pretty quick ۥ‘cause other people jumped on me as well, but  
        basically what I did was put me hand out quickly to try and stop someone getting’ hit so, it was just a gut reaction. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 44 Did the glass break? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A It may have done. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 45 What do you mean by that? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Well can’t really recall exactly what happened.  
        Basically, I put me hand out and tried to stop someone from hittin’ someone else and got stuck in the middle of it. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [After saying he could see the victim coming to hit his brother with his left fist closed] 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 58….and then what happened? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A  
        I just intervened thinkin’, oh, well, you know, I don’t want him to get hit. I can see, ’cause my brother probably couldn’t see him comin’, so I’m thinkin’, oh, well, best thing to do is just try and, you know, stop the guy from bowlin’ someone over, so I’ll stick my hand out. Did it pretty quickly though, like, it was a gut reaction, so it’s put me hand out quick. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 147 Now, do you think by putting your arm out with the glass near that person’s face was a reckless thing to do? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A I don’t think so, I think I was tryin’ to prevent any injuries, not incur them, so, or cause them, you know, it’s purely, like I say, a gut reaction tryin’, you know protect someone else, and do it the most, you know, effective way to not hurt anyone else. The fact that, you know, it slipped me mind that there’s a glass in me hand’s a secondary issue. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 148 Well, would you think that if someone was to push a glass or a schooner glass towards someone’s face that it may cause injury? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A Well, there’s nothin’ good about it, but like I say, you know, I wasn’t thinking about a glass even being in me hand, 
         I was quite happy with the conversations I was having, and having a good time, you know, the last time [sic] on me mind was other people tryin’ to invade our space by being violent. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 151 Do you think a glass pushed into someone’s face at force would cause injury? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A I guess it would, but you know, my intentions were nothing like that. Like I say, it was purely a gut reaction. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q 152 Do you think your reaction was reckless? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A I don’t think so um, like I say, you know,  
        I was protecting someone else, not tryin’ to cause injury, probably, if anything trying to prevent it. 
        ” (emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    The appellant did not give or call evidence at trial.13 The appellant agreed he was wearing a blue t-shirt with white stripes on the sleeves and that it had a considerable amount of blood on it. He described himself as “a total non-aggressor towards the whole thing”.14 Police Officers Ronald King and Daniel Black attended at the Hotel after the incident. They saw three men at the front arguing with hotel security, including a man who was not wearing a shirt and another wearing a blue t-shirt with a large amount of blood on it. They heard both men say on numerous occasions: 
     
      
       
        
        “We smashed them brother. Those Maori cunts didn’t know what hit them.” 
        
       
      
    15 It was put to the victim in cross-examination that he had moved quickly over to the man in the white shirt with the intention of punching him in the head, a proposition he denied. It was also put to him that the man in the blue shirt (the appellant) had “stuck his hand out to try and stop you”, a proposition he also denied.16 Messrs Plummer, Tierney and Monsall were all cross-examined on the basis that they were mistaken in their observations of the incident, propositions they denied. 
     
      
      The Crown case at trial. 
      
    17 The Crown Prosecutor opened the Crown case to the jury by telling it that there were two elements of the offence of malicious wounding: 
     
      
       
        
        “That the accused maliciously by any means which means that the accused either did what he did deliberately with intent to cause some injury, not necessarily the injury caused. Or he did so recklessly. That is knowing that it was possible that some injury could occur and in both cases without lawful excuse. That is, in acting maliciously he either did it deliberately or recklessly.” (19/7/05, T pp12-13). 
        
       
      
    18 Counsel for the appellant also opened to the jury and said (19/7/05,T p26) that what was in dispute was how the victim was injured.19 In his final address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor repeated that the Crown’s case was that the accused had maliciously wounded the victim by shoving a glass into his face: 
     
      
       
        
        “… either deliberately with intent to cause injury, not necessarily [the next portion of his address was not transcribable] but deliberately to cause injury, or did so recklessly. That is knowing that it was possible that some injury might occur, recklessly went ahead anyway.” 
        
       
      
    20 He concluded his address by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the Crown’s submission the accused did it deliberately. He struck Mr Pira deliberately with that glass and you might think even on the accused’s version he says he had the glass he wasn’t sure what had happened to him but you might think that what he did in view that he was holding a glass was reckless at the very least. In the Crown’s submission a deliberate act, a deliberate act. And that you would have no difficulty after careful analysis of the evidence being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted maliciously.” 
        
       
      
    21 Counsel for the appellant addressed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “There’s no dispute about wounding. We know that Mr Pira got wounded, the question is was it the accused wounded him, I suggest that there’s some real doubt about that and even if you can resolve that doubt and come to a conclusion  
        beyond reasonable doubt that those injuries were inflicted by Mr Pengilley, the accused, then the other element of the offence, maliciously, which has been described by the learned Crown as either deliberately or recklessly comes into play. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In the course of my submissions I’m going to be submitting to you that you’ll have some real difficulties working out what happened on this night, really. There’s only about one thing that you can be sure of, I suggest and that’s that Mr Pira was coming over to belt his brother. As to what happened after that it’s very hard to piece together but maliciously and deliberately, well there’s a few hoops to get through in my submission to the Crown before you could find Mr Pengilley guilty. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … If you can be satisfied that all of those things happened, that Mr Pengilley did put his hand out striking deliberately not accidentally, because accident has been raised by Mr Pengilley,  
        that what he did, he did reflexively, not being aware or conscious of the glass, or taking it into account or having any intent with it 
        . That’s effectively what he said, so that the glass I just stuck my hand out, I wasn’t thinking about the glass, I don’t know what happened to the glass. Self defence by sticking his arm out you would think would be reasonable, but even if you could come to the conclusion on the factual circumstances as described that he did that deliberately, having the opportunity to think about the glass and going ahead anyway, in the circumstances, self defence arises.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The summing up 
      
    22 In the course of his summing up the trial judge read to the jury s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the definition of “maliciously” in s 5 of the Crimes Act.  He reminded the jury that the Crown’s case was that the appellant had acted recklessly.23 At the conclusion of the summing up, in the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant asked the trial judge to give a direction to the jury which would explain the concept of recklessness. The following exchange then took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: There is no statutory definition of it, is there? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Counsel: No, there’s no statutory definition, your Honour, but the jury needs, in my submission to have explained to them what reckless is and in the circumstance of this case, in my submission, given that there is an explanation given by the accused which they are entitled to consider, the question of – and you[r] Honour has indicated deliberately does that act, your Honour did direct the jury that deliberately does that act. In my submission that needs to be clarified as to what they need to determine, because it is raised by the accused that he deliberately did an act of swinging his hand, they may find that he had a glass in it, in my submission that is the act that they need to find he deliberately did, deliberately swung with a glass as opposed to what he had claimed and raised as a defence in effect, accident or reflex which goes directly to the issue of intent. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR; Yes, I see what you are putting. Well as I am going to bring them back I will remind them that the Crown opened deliberate act and I will tell them that for the Crown to succeed on that limb of it, they must be satisfied that he knew he had the glass in his hand when he made the movement he did. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Counsel: Yes. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: What do you say recklessness involves. 
         
         
        Counsel: Recklessness in the commentary in the Criminal Procedure, under the actual definition of maliciously, there is a short section which deals with -  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR; Yes. 
         
         
        Counsel: -- there foresight of the consequences. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I will put that. I should have done that. All right, bring them back please. Is there anything else?” 
         
         
        
       
      
    24 The jury was brought back into court after argument not presently relevant. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “First of all, I read to you the definition of maliciously and it referred of course to acts done with intent to injure and it referred to acts done recklessly. Thereafter, I said that the Crown had opened to you that his allegation was one of recklessness. That is indeed correct but I failed to tell you that the Crown also opened that what the accused did was deliberate. So you have those two matters to consider.” 
         
        
       
      
    25 His Honour did not give the jury the direction about the concept of recklessness as he had said he would. Neither counsel drew that omission to his attention.26 During the course of its deliberations the jury asked a number of questions, including seeking a copy of the definition of malicious. His Honour then appears to have given them a copy of the definition in s 5 of the Crimes Act.27 The jury delivered its guilty verdict after deliberating for approximately three hours. 
     
      
      Submissions 
      
    28 The appellant complains that the trial judge’s direction as to the meaning of “maliciously” was inadequate. He submits that it was not sufficient for his Honour to read out the definition of “maliciously” in s 5 but, rather, that he had to explain the concept of “recklessly”, and his failure to do so meant the jury was left to work out what “recklessly” meant. He contends his Honour ought to have given the jury the directions on “maliciously” set out in the Bench Book, in particular that he ought to have directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused is reckless if at the time the act was done there was a realisation on the part of the accused that some physical harm – but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done – may possibly be inflicted yet he or she went ahead and acted. The accused cannot be found to have acted recklessly if the accused did not apply his mind to the consequences of his/her act.” 
        
       
      
    29 The appellant submits that it was that direction which his counsel sought at trial. He argues that if the jury had been properly directed there was a real possibility it would have found he had not applied his mind to the consequences of his act. He contends that the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury properly led to a miscarriage of justice bearing in mind that the major issue at trial was the cause of the victim’s injuries.30 The Crown relies on the fact that after the trial judge brought the jury back and directed it that in addition to the Crown case being based on recklessness, the Crown had also opened that what the accused did was deliberate, counsel for the appellant had not complained again as to the adequacy of his Honour’s direction in relation to recklessness. 31 Further, the Crown contends that the appellant’s case at trial was not that he did not realise it was a possible consequence of his act that some physical harm might be occasioned. Accordingly there was no need for a direction on recklessness. The Crown drew attention to the fact that the appellant had not suggested in his ERISP that he did not realise some injury might possibly have flowed from his act, but claimed he had put his hand out to stop his brother from being hit (see Q/A 37, 43, 45 and 58). While the appellant had suggested that he did not realise he had a glass in his hand at the time he raised it, the Crown submits there was no evidence it did not cross his mind that raising his hand would carry a risk of harm. The Crown submits that in the absence of evidence that the appellant did not realise that some injury would flow from his act, a direction on the meaning of recklessness was not required. The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s claim of self-defence suggested that he did realise some injury would flow from his act.32 The Crown also relies upon the fact that the trial judge gave the jury clear directions about the appellant’s claim of self-defence about which no complaint is made and that once, as is apparent from the verdict, the jury rejected the claim of self-defence, there was ample evidence that at the very least the appellant realised the possibility of some physical harm but went ahead anyway.33 Finally the Crown contends that if the Court concluded that the trial judge’s direction on “maliciously” was inadequate, this was not a case where a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred: s 6, Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Crown relies upon the fact that although the jury sought a copy of the definition of “maliciously” it did not seek further directions on either the meaning of that term or the term “recklessly”. Secondly, the Crown submits, once the appellant’s version of events given in his ERISP was rejected by the jury, the evidence of Mr Plummer, Mr Monsall, Mr Tierney and Senior Constable King and Constable Black overwhelmingly established that the injury was inflicted maliciously. 
     
      
      Consideration  
      
    34 Crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent: R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; (2002) 55 NSWLR 80 at [60] per Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and Kirby J concurring.35 In R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 at 472, Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed) described the concept of “malice” as calling for “meticulous analysis and fine and practical decisions to be made by the jury (for which task such a body is quite ill-suited).”36 In Coleman the accused was charged with maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The jury was directed (see 471) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The malicious infliction of injury was established if the appellant had wielded the bottle either with the intention of causing some injury such as was in fact caused or if he did so recklessly.” 
        
       
      
    The judge defined the concept of recklessness as  
     
      
       
        
        “… a realisation of the possibility that some such injury might result but nevertheless proceeded to act.” 
        
       
      
    37 Hunt J (at 471) said that was the correct direction as based on R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396 at 399-400. He rejected (see 471-472, 476) the appellant’s argument that realisation of the possibility of injury was insufficient and that the accused had to realise the probability or likelihood of injury in order to have acted recklessly for the purpose of malice.38 In this case the Crown contended the appellant was guilty of maliciously wounding the victim because he injured him, either deliberately or recklessly.39 The appellant’s case, in part, was that he put his arm out “reflexively, not being aware or conscious of the glass, or taking it into account or having any intent with it”. While his counsel put that proposition to the jury in the context of advancing his self-defence argument, the argument also squarely raised the issue whether the appellant had the intent, let alone foresight of the consequences, essential to a finding he had acted recklessly.40 In such circumstances it was, in my view, essential that his Honour explain to the jury that to establish the appellant had acted recklessly, the Crown had to prove he acted as he did, realising the possibility that some injury might result from his action.41 It was not sufficient for the trial judge to read the s 5 definition of “maliciously” to the jury, nor to give the jury a copy of the definition. In R v Safwan, (1986) 8 NSWLR 97 Street CJ (with whom Lee and McInerney JJ agreed, subject to a qualification not presently relevant) said, in substance, (at 102) that, in some circumstances, quoting a section of a statute may mislead a jury. More recently in R v Micalizzi [2004] NSWCCA 406 at [36] Simpson J (with whom Hulme and Howie JJ relevantly agreed) expressed the opinion that “it is not good practice to read legislation to a jury” and that “were it necessary to refer to a legal principle derived from a statute, it is the effect of the provision, so far as it is relevant to the issues before the jury, and not its precise terms, that should be conveyed.”42 The Crown draws attention to the fact that counsel for the appellant did not complain, at trial, about the trial judge providing a copy of the statutory definition to the jury so that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 applies. This is so, but the success of the appeal does not turn upon the sole issue of providing a copy of the definition of “maliciously” to the jury. The question is whether the jury was properly instructed having regard to the facts and the issues to be decided: R v Chai [2002] HCA 12; (2002) 76 ALJR 628 at [18]. It was essential that his Honour’s direction conveyed to the jury what was necessary to enable it to discharge its function: R v Williams (1990) 50 A Crim R 213 at [222] per Badgery-Parker J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Wood J agreed).43 The significance of providing the jury with a statutory definition which does not address the concept of recklessness lies in its potential, in a given case, to mislead.44 The Crown has contended that the trial judge was under no obligation to explain the concept of recklessness to the jury relying on R v Safwan at [102]; R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 at [98]; R v Cato [1976] 1 All ER 260 at [268]; R v Williams (1990) 50 A Crim R 213 at [222]. In those cases, however, the trial judge had given a direction or indication as to the meaning of recklessness which was held to be sufficient in the circumstances.45 This was a case in which, in my view, (and as the trial judge himself recognised) a direction as to the concept of recklessness was required. The failure to explain that concept may well, as the appellant submits, have misled the jury, leaving them to believe, for example, that it was sufficient that the appellant, although not intending to inflict injury, had acted recklessly merely because he deliberately put his hand out with a glass in it. Absent a direction as to the concept of recklessness, the jury may well not have appreciated it was necessary, in order to find the appellant had acted recklessly, that in addition to putting his hand out with the glass deliberately, he had a foresight of the possibility that some injury such as was caused might result, but nevertheless proceeded to act.46 The Crown submits that the appellant did not suggest in his interview with the police that he did not realise that some injury might possibly have flowed from his act. In my view, the passages from the ERISP which I have underlined (at [12]) sufficiently raised the issue of the appellant not foreseeing the consequences of his act to require a direction from the trial judge.47 As to the Crown’s submission that counsel for the appellant did not complain following the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury as to the concept of recklessness in the manner he had indicated, I do not regard that as affecting the manner in which this point can be considered on appeal. The Crown does not suggest that r 4 arises in relation to this ground of appeal but, rather, appears to contend that, in some fashion, counsel had abandoned the complaint about the adequacy of the trial judge’s direction in relation to recklessness. It is possible to conceive of an argument that trial counsel’s silence at this stage indicates that, in the atmosphere of the trial, he did not consider this issue to have been important so that there was not, in the circumstances, a miscarriage of justice: see Saffron (No 1) v R (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 at 434. In the circumstances of this trial, however, I do not so understand trial counsel’s conduct. A better explanation is that having asked once, been told by the trial judge that his submission had been successful but then not hearing the direction emerging from his Honour, he regarded that as a reversal of his Honour’s earlier decision. I think it would have been desirable for trial counsel to have pursued the matter however that failure is not fatal to the appeal.48 Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge’s direction on “maliciously” was inadequate and, subject to the Crown’s submissions as to the application of the proviso in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the appeal should succeed.49 In my view this is not a case for the operation of the proviso. In R v Whittaker (1993) 68 A Crim R 476 at 484 the Court held that an important consideration as to the application of the proviso was whether the appellant had lost a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him. In particular, the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Grove J) observed “there is a diminished inclination in recent times to invoke the proviso (even in otherwise very strong Crown cases) where misdirection has been shown upon an important ingredient of the law applicable to the trial.” In my view that is this case. 
     
      
      Orders 
      
    50 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Quash the conviction of the appellant for malicious wounding and the sentence imposed upon him following that conviction. 
       
       
      3. Order a new trial. 
      
    51 ADAMS J: I agree with McColl JA and Latham J52 LATHAM J: I have had the opportunity of reading Justice McColl's judgment in draft and I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons in support of those orders. I wish to add a few remarks on the adequacy of the summing up, particularly in relation to the case advanced on the appellant’s behalf at trial. 53 Before doing so, it is helpful to review the meaning of ""maliciously"" as expounded in the course of Justice Hunt's judgment in R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25 at 40: 
     
      
       
        
        “In Kenny’s ‘Outlines of Criminal Law’ (19th edition, 1966) at 211, the author stated : 
         
        ‘The principle is that in any statutory definition of a crime ‘malice’ must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general, but as requiring either (1) an actual intention to do  
        the particular kind of harm that in fact was done 
         or (2) recklessness as to whether  
        such harm 
         should occur or not (that is, the accused has foreseen that  
        the particular kind of harm 
         might be done, and yet has gone on to take the risk of it.)’ 
         
        That statement in the 16th edition (1952 at 186) was approved by the (English) Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Regina v Cunningham 
         [1957] 2 QB 396 at 399 -- 400. See also  
        Regina v Mowatt 
         [1968] 1 QB 421 at 426 -- 427. This Court has also approved of that statement:  
        Regina v Coleman 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 at 477. In the same case (at 475), it was said: 
         
        ‘ …in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that  
        the particular kind of harm in fact done 
         (that is, some physical harm -- but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted.’ 
         
        That was a statement of the law generally accepted in Australia at the time of the High Court's decision in  
        The Queen v Crabbe 
         (1985) 156 CLR 464. In  
        Regina v Coleman 
         (at 476), it was held that the decision in  
        The Queen v Crabbe 
         should not be interpreted as requiring any change in that generally accepted law. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    54 Applying these principles to the instant case, the recklessness allegedly inherent in the appellant’s conduct was recklessness as to the wounding of Mr Pira, not recklessness as to whether the appellant had a glass in his hand. The evidence upon which the Crown relied at trial was capable of establishing that the appellant deliberately struck Mr Pira in the face whilst holding a beer glass, intending to wound him. There was cogent evidence to that effect from other patrons of the hotel that night and from two police officers who overheard the appellant and his brother boasting, in effect, about the assault. However, the Crown also relied on recklessness as to the wounding, namely, that the appellant struck Mr Pira by extending his arm whilst holding a beer glass, realising the possibility that Mr Pira might be wounded, but choosing nonetheless to so act. Both required an awareness by the appellant that he was holding a beer glass at the relevant time. This was a feature of the Crown case that his Honour seemed to entirely overlook. 55 His Honour’s misunderstanding is evident from the exchange set out at par 23 above. His Honour seems to think that only proof of intentional wounding required satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s knowledge of the glass in his hand. Regrettably, this misunderstanding was compounded by the appellant’s counsel, who, it seems to me, also suffered from a degree of confusion on this score. A direction on recklessness would have done nothing to highlight for the jury the thrust of the appellant’s case as it was expressed in the ERISP. 56 The account given by the appellant in the course of his ERISP, and relied upon by the appellant’s counsel at trial, suggested that the appellant was unaware that he was holding a glass at the time that he extended his arm towards Mr Pira. Specifically, at Q 147 the appellant said that ""it slipped me mind that there’s a glass in me hand” and at Q 148 “I wasn't thinking about a glass even being in the hand”. Counsel’s address took up this theme :- 
     
      
       
        
        If you can be satisfied that all of those things happened, that [the appellant] did put his hand out striking deliberately not accidentally,  
        because accident has been raised by [the appellant], that what he did he did reflexively, not being aware or conscious of the glass, or taking it into account or having any intent with it 
        . 
        
       
      
    57 Leaving to one side the issue of self defence, there were two limbs to the appellant's defence at trial. Firstly, that the Crown had failed to prove to the requisite standard that it was the appellant who caused Mr Pira's injuries, and alternatively, that the appellant had wounded Mr Pira accidentally. Self defence need not have been addressed unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant struck Mr Pira with the intention of wounding him, or that when the appellant struck Mr Pira with the glass in his hand, he applied his mind to the consequences of that act. Either way, the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant was aware he was holding the glass. If they were not so satisfied, the appellant was entitled to an acquittal.58 With respect to his Honour, the summing up completely failed to explain these distinct aspects of the appellant’s case at trial. The jury was never directed that they had to be satisfied that the appellant was aware of the glass in his hand when he struck Mr Pira, despite his Honour stating that he would so direct in relation to the intentional wounding. In many respects, the summing up failed to put the appellant’s case at all. His Honour referred to the evidence in the Crown case at length, before saying “you will of course have regard to what the accused told the police in the course of his interview. You will give such weight to it as you see fit.” (SU 20) His Honour then repeated a number of the questions and answers in the ERISP (from Q 38 to Q 67 at SU 20-21), before saying :- 
     
      
       
        
        As I said before I went into that evidence, what you have got to do before you get to the accused’s state of mind is to satisfy yourself as to what happened. …. It is only then that you can come to the issues involving the state of mind of the accused. You will remember when you are doing that, that I directed you earlier about matters involving intention. In doing that, I pointed out that you may have regard to what a person says before, during or after the time that he acts, in order to determine his intention. (SU 21) 
        
       
      
    59 This passage at pp 20-21 of the summing up was virtually the entirety of his Honour’s reference to the appellant’s case, and even then, it occurred in the context of a discussion about fact finding and intentional wounding. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the trial fundamentally miscarried.

     REGINA v Hien Phuoc TANG 
     
     
      
      Facts 
      
    The Appellant was convicted of one count of robbery when armed with an offensive weapon. The robbery occurred in a convenience store and was videotaped by a surveillance device. The tape showed three offenders but was not of sufficient quality to enable clear identification of the offenders. Two of the offenders were arrested forty minutes after the offence. The car in which they were travelling contained property like that stolen from the convenience store. DNA evidence connected the co-offenders to hats in the car, which matched those worn by two of the offenders on the surveillance video. The co-offenders pleaded guilty.The Appellant came to the attention of the police eight months after the robbery and was linked to the offence through fingerprints found on some of the stolen goods. At trial the Appellant gave evidence that he had met the co-offenders some months prior to his arrest in order to purchase marijuana. As part of this transaction he said he had purchased some cigarettes, in the course of which he handled various packets within the bag of stolen goods. The Crown case turned to a significant degree on opinion evidence from Dr Meiya Sutisno, who identified points of resemblance between the surveillance images of the third offender and photographs of the Appellant based on facial mapping and body mapping techniques. Dr Sutisno expressed three kinds of opinion: first, that the two bodies of photographs depicted the same person; secondly, that there was a level of support to this conclusion by application of a six point scale; and, thirdly, that certain characteristics were “unique identifiers”. 
     
      
      Held (allowing the appeal): 
       
      1. Admission of the curriculum vitae  
      
    Dr Sutisno’s curriculum vitae was correctly admitted and did not lead to unfair prejudice. [92] 
     
      
      2. Directions as to the ultimate issue 
      
    The use of the phrase “ultimate issue” in the trial judge’s directions did not lead to a miscarriage of justice, particularly as the witness did eventually give evidence of identity. [97] 
     
      
      3. Expert evidence regarding co-accused 
      
    The expert evidence identifying the co-accused from the surveillance video was relevant. It was a significant part of the Crown’s case to establish that the co-accused were two of the offenders pictured in the video tape. The Crown was not restricted in how they established that fact. This evidence reinforced the witness’ methodology and expertise. [99]-[100], [102]-[104]. However, the Appellant did not at trial, or on appeal, seek to rely on the discretion to exclude unfairly prejudicial evidence. Rule 4 applied. [104] 
     
      
      4. The jury question 
      
    When putting a question from the jury to Dr Sutisno, the trial judge did not invite a self-serving answer or impermissibly descend into the arena. [107], [109]. 
     
      
      5. The trial judges’ directions 
      
    The trial judges directions were not confusing or inadequate. In one respect raised on appeal, his Honour directed the jury in accordance with the submissions of the Appellant’s legal representative at the trial. [113], [117]-[119]. 
     
      
      6. Admissibility of expert opinion evidence 
      
    Evidence of similarities between the photographs of the Appellant and the photographs of the third offender was admissible. This evidence was based on the witness’ specialised knowledge and on experience gained through multiple viewing of the two sets of images. [120](Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict.) (1987) 164 CLR 180; R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405; R v Li (2003) 139 A Crim R 28 cited.)The three kinds of opinion expressed by Dr Sutisno were not admissible. [121](In the matter of the appeal of BLM (District Court of New South Wales, unreported, 14 September 2005) and The Queen v Murdoch (No 4) [2005] NTSC 78 considered.)In order to be admitted under s79 Evidence Act 1995 an opinion must satisfy the two limbs of the section. First, an area of “specialised knowledge” derived from either “training, study or experience” must be identified. Second, the opinion must be shown to be based “wholly or substantially” on the identified area of specialised knowledge. [134]The focus of attention must be on the meaning of the statutory phrase “specialised knowledge”, rather than by invoking extraneous ideas such as “reliability”. In the context of “specialised knowledge”, the word “knowledge” connotes more than subjective belief and unsupported speculation.(Velevski v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 402, Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v George (New South Wales Supreme Court, unreported, 19 November 1997), Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia [1999] NSWSC 828 cited; Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc 509 US 579 (1993) considered.)On the evidence at trial there does appear to be an area of specialised knowledge based on facial identification. However, no foundation was lain that evidence of body mapping constitutes an area of specialist knowledge. (R v Li (2003) 139 A Crim R 28 referred to.) Because this technique formed an important part of the three opinions set out above, they fail to satisfy the first limb of s79. [135]-[136], [140]. With respect to each of the three opinions expressed, the witness did not reveal her process of reasoning and therefore failed to satisfy the second limb of s79.

     Judgment 
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was charged with one count of robbery when armed with an offensive weapon. An offence occurred on 14 March 2003 at about 3.55am at a convenience store in Ultimo, Sydney. The Appellant was tried before Finanne DCJ and a jury. He was found guilty. 2 The robbery had been videotaped by means of a surveillance device installed on the premises. The videotape showed that three offenders were involved. However, it was not of sufficient quality to enable viewers to clearly identify the offenders. Two co-accused, Hai Dang Nguyen and Qouc Toan Nguyen, pleaded guilty on the first day of a joint trial. The issue in the trial that proceeded was whether the Appellant was the third offender. The Crown case was that the Appellant was the person who appeared on the tape wearing black clothing and, at one stage, had a gun in his right hand. 3 The property stolen from the convenience store comprised $910 in cash, 202 packets of cigarettes of different brands and a quantity of chewing gum of a particular type and brand. The co-accused were arrested about 40 minutes after the offence. In the car in which they were travelling there was located a plastic garbage bag containing 44 packets of cigarettes and eight packets of chewing gum of the type and brand taken in the course of the robbery along with cash in the form of $53 in coins. One of the co-accused had $300 in bank notes in his pockets. The clothing worn by the co-accused at the time of their arrest and/or located in their car matched that worn by two of the participants in the robbery as displayed in the surveillance video. The connection was reinforced by DNA found in the distinctive caps of the co-accused.4 The Appellant came to the attention of the Police some eight months after the robbery. His fingerprints were found to match fingerprints located on three of the packets of cigarettes found in the car driven by the co-accused on the day of the robbery.5 At his trial the Appellant gave evidence that, on an occasion some months before his arrest, he had arranged to meet Dang Nguyen and Qouc Toan Nguyen in order to buy a quantity of marijuana. He said that he met them, in company with a third man, in a vehicle corresponding to the description of that in which the co-accused were arrested, which was parked in a laneway in the City of Sydney. He said it was in the early hours of the morning. He got into the car and bought some marijuana and four packets of Winfield Gold cigarettes at a discount price. His evidence was that, in the process of making this purchase, he handled a number of objects in the black garbage bag, while looking for his preferred brand of cigarettes.6 The person working at the convenience store at the time of the robbery gave evidence that the offender, being the man in a black shirt who produced the gun, asked for Winfield Gold cigarettes. That is the brand that the Appellant said was his brand. However, the person was not able to give positive identification evidence from the photographs shown to him. Instead he chose three photographs saying that they “might be” the third offender. 7 The Crown case turned to a significant degree on the expert testimony of Dr Meiya Sutisno. Dr Sutisno’s qualifications to give evidence and his Honour’s directions with respect to this evidence is the critical issue in this appeal.  
     
      
      The Voir Dire 
      
    8 The admissibility of the evidence of Dr Sutisno was challenged on a voir dire. His Honour viewed the videotape of the robbery and still photographs taken from that videotape. His Honour said with respect to the photographs of the third offender:  
     
      
       
        
        “Still photographs have been prepared of that particular view of that particular robber's face and photographs of him and the others at various stages have also been obtained. It is my opinion, looking at that photograph, that the jury could not determine who that photograph actually showed; it is too blurry; the facial features are quite hard to see; it is not possible to see if the person is of any particular racial composition.” 
        
       
      
    9 On the basis of the material before him, his Honour concluded with respect to the expertise of Dr Sutisno: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Sutisno is clearly an expert in the field of forensic anatomy and she has a particular specialty within that quite broad field of facial identification; that is, analysing faces from surveillance images and face reconstruction from the skull. I am satisfied from her curriculum vitae and the examples she has given of analysis she has done that she has on numerous occasions performed face analysis to assist police with possible identification of persons who have committed crimes. She has also considerable experience in identifying people from skulls and parts of their body. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        For the purpose of determining whether a particular person is a person whose face she is looking at, she on occasions examines the whole of the body movements, posture, walking, the way in which hands are held and other features which indicate the way in which particular people stand and move and look. She is much more than an artist or someone qualified by long experience of doing something. She is someone who has very high qualifications in anatomy and extensive experience in applying those qualifications. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
        As part of her technique of identification of persons, she studies videos of the type I have mentioned that have been shown in this court and still photographs and compares them with photographs taken of particular suspects. She uses computer programming to enhance the video images to determine what characteristics there are of the particular face, looking for distinctive features, eyes, nose, cheek bones, mouth and so on.” 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour described Dr Sutisno’s proposed evidence in the present case as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [S]he looked for features of the face. What she discovered were a number of features in the video when she played it back and forth and enhanced the photo to determine what the main features were. It showed distinctive features of the person in the video. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She then got the photographs supplied by the police, ensured that they were of correct dimensions and using a technique with which she is familiar, superimposed one photograph on the other and determined that there was a match - four out of six characteristics, or four out of six was her determination. Her view was that the person in the video was the person in the photograph. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In my opinion, no juror looking at the video could come to any such conclusion and if the best evidence and only evidence were the video evidence, if there was no other evidence linking the accused to the case, it would be my view I would have to exclude that evidence altogether as being too unreliable. Without an expert, it would be impossible to determine what the video material showed.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour concluded that Sutisno had the expert knowledge to give the expert opinion and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have looked carefully at the way in which she expresses her opinion. She appears to me to express her opinion based on facts made known to her and entirely within the field of her own expertise. I do not accept that she can be regarded as an expert anatomist and could give evidence of morphology, but when she uses computer enhancement photographs, she is in some way going outside her field as an expert.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In my opinion her field as an expert requires her to use technology which includes placing photographs through scanners on to computers and using appropriate software to bring those photographs up and enhance them so that she can see the features. I see no difficulty in her being regarded as doing that within her expertise. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is no requirement, as such, that she establish to a jury by producing the computer images, exactly what she did. She might choose to do that. The Crown might choose to do that. It is a matter for the Crown. Her evidence of course is subject to attack. The fact that in my opinion it is admissible, does not mean it is not subject to attack, and it is a matter for the jury to evaluate that evidence and decide, if they accept it. It has to be said that she is much more than an artist or a person whose expertise has been obtained merely by looking at photographs over many years. She is someone whose expertise comes from her knowledge of anatomy, that is, of the body, features of the body underneath the skin.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour was asked to exclude the evidence in the exercise of discretion. 13 With respect to s135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), his Honour said that he was of the view that the evidence was of “very substantial value” and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing, in my opinion, unfairly prejudicial to the accused in the admission of this evidence. I am unable to come to the conclusion that the evidence might be misleading or confusing. At least in theory as to whether in fact, as it is given that occurs, is a different matter, but I cannot prophesy for the purpose of determining whether something should be excluded, whether in fact it could be misleading or confusing, as given to the jury. That may be so. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        If that occurred, and I came to the conclusion that the evidence itself, as presented, was misleading or confusing, I would revisit the question of exclusion of it and would exclude the evidence, even though it had been given.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour also referred to the s137 discretion and concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. His Honour indicated that he would reconsider the issue of unfairness if raised again after the evidence was given. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the opinion, to make it perfectly plain, that without this evidence, the jury would be unable to come to any conclusion about the identity of the person in the black garb as shown in the video. It would require a guess on their part and I do not think that any jury can be asked to guess.” 
        
       
      
    15 It will be necessary below to outline some of the evidence given on the voir dire as to the qualifications of Dr Sutisno and the area of expertise which she professes. Further evidence in this regard was given during the course of the trial.  
     
      
      The Course of the Trial 
      
    16 Dr Sutisno was supplied with the videotape of the offence and stills extracted from it, together with forensic photographs of the Appellant and his two co-offenders. Dr Sutisno played the video at different speeds, froze the video and magnified the images on her computer. She used a magnifying glass to further enhance the images.17 Facial and body mapping employs three techniques: photo-anthropometry, morphological analysis and photograph superimposition.18 A list of definitions became an exhibit at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “

        Morphology analysis [facial and body mapping] 
         
         
          
          The feature by feature approach to evaluating faces, heads and bodies. It involves the comparison of two images – one from the crime scene and one of the suspect. It involves subdividing the face, head and body into components to obtain a thorough qualitative analysis and to determine visual similarities or differences. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Photograph superimposition 
         
         
          
          A process of overlaying two comparably enlarged images to provide a visual display through the use of video or computer technology of the definitive similarities or differences between the offender and suspect. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Unique identifiers 
         
         
          
          These are features distinctive to an individual [the most recognisable features] such as deformities, blemishes, tattoos or habitual characteristics [for example, posture, limp or fidgeting]. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Photo-anthropometry 
         
         
          
          Photo-anthropometry is a technique that attempts to metrically compare the proportional relationships of one photo to another rather than determine absolute visual similarities, as is done in morphological comparisons. It involves the analysis of anthropometric landmarks, dimensions and angles [simply] to quantify facial characteristics and proportions from a photograph. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Adobe Photoshop 6.0 
         
         
          
          Visual graphic software that enables the operator to magnify, enhance, adjust opacity or contrast or brightness, sharpen, rotate or tilt a photographic image.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 Dr Sutisno compared measurements and dimensions of faces (photo-anthropometry) and individual facial and body features (morphological analysis). She magnified photographs of the offender to the same size as the suspect, changed the opacity of one before putting it on top of the other, in order to see whether the features aligned or one could be overlayed over the other (photograph superimposition). Furthermore, she identified distinctive individual characteristic and habits, which she called “unique identifiers”. 20 Dr Sutisno used photo-anthropometry as a first step in facial and body mapping, but did not rely solely on the findings of this procedure because of the possibility of two or more people having the same dimensions. She regards morphological analysis as more accurate than photo-anthropometry, because it compares individual facial and body features and takes into account distinctive characteristic habits of the individual. She asserts that morphological analysis provides results sufficient to show whether two sets of photographs people were of the same person or not. 21 Ms McSpedden, who appeared for the Appellant at trial, made an application to discharge the jury based on the fact that the photo boards used by Dr Sutisno in giving her evidence did not contain the material she had herself used in order to come to her conclusions. The particular mechanisms of computer-generated images which she had employed could not be replicated in the court. His Honour rejected the application on the basis that it was often not possible to reproduce in court the precise tests used by an expert. There is no appeal based on this issue.22 A substantial proportion of Dr Sutisno’s evidence consisted of identifying comparable features between the two sets of material, i.e. of the offender and of the suspect. The videotape, or the stills derived therefrom, was not in a fit state to be compared by the jury with the photographs of the three suspects. The Appellant does not challenge the admissibility of this part of the evidence about himself. 23 The focus of the appeal is Dr Sutisno’s positive evidence that the Appellant was the person depicted in the video. This was given in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now after you had conducted all of those comparisons and all of those things that you do as part of your method were you in a position to form a view as to the identity of the person in the black shirt on the surveillance video as compared to the person identified as Mr Tang in the forensic procedure photographs? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. What opinion did you reach? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A. The results of the analysis lends support to positive identification. Given my experience in looking at faces and analysing them, matching them, etcetera and building them up as well, I formed the opinion that given that number of matches I’m of the opinion that they’re of the same, one and the same. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. One and the same person? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    24 Dr Sutisno said that the quality of matches of comparable features, not the quantity, were key to her findings. A lot of points which did not uniquely or distinctly characterise a person carried, in her view, less weight than a small number of what she called “unique identifier” points. She said that this type of analysis required an understanding of anatomy, including the interrelationship between bone (a constant) and the gross dimensions of the face. Dr Sutisno confirmed that, in her analysis of the Appellant and the co-offenders, she took into account their underlying skulls and skeletal make-ups. She said morphological analysis was not affected by the height or distance from which a surveillance photograph may have been taken, as long as both photographs used for comparison were of similar perspective (angle). In cross-examination she said that only a gross distortion of the angle (a completely different angle) would make a difference to such analysis. 25 With respect to the Appellant, a photo board containing the two sets of photographs was tendered, along with a Morphological Features Chart. Dr Sutisno outlined her mechanism of adjusting the photographs so that they had the same angle. Her evidence included a comparison between the two sets of material in terms of identifying similarities such as the thickness of the lips, the existence of a dimple on the chin, the fact that each chin was “squarish” and the jaw structure “angular”. She also identified, in accordance with her classification that was before the jury, that the two facial forms were “pentagonal”, that the facial height was “medium”, and there was a “lateral projection” of the cheekbones, meaning a projection to the side. She referred to a wide chin and visible lips seam, a slight projection of the ears and what is described as a “mezzo-cranic head shape”, meaning a short, broad and high head with a flattened occipital region, being the back of the head. She also identified a number of the features in both sets of material as characteristics of an Asian person. She referred to similarities in terms of the “upright posture of the upper torso”. Dr Sutisno also identified three “unique identifiers”: the lips, the wide square chin with a dimple and the posture. 26 In her Statement, Dr Sutisno summarised her morphological analysis of photographs of the Appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[22] Morphological Analysis of the face and body revealed definitive resemblance of the most noticeable features (i.e. pentagonal face shape, pronounced projection of cheekbones, wide and thick upper and lower lips, wide square chin with dimple and relatively upright posture) and several details of additional morphological features such as slight ear projection and black coloured hair with visible sideburns. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [23] More significantly were the definitive resemblance of the wide and thick upper and lower lips, wide square chin with dimple, and relatively upright posture which constitute as ‘unique identifiers’ or most distinctive features, enhances the support for positive identification.” 
        
       
      
    27 With respect to the process of Photographic Superimposition Dr Sutisno summarised her more detailed report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] When enlarged still frame images of the offender were superimposed onto an identically sized forensic photographs of Hein TANG, definitive resemblances were discovered with respect to the facial outline, lateral projections of the cheekbones, form and projection of the chin, jaw line, width and shape of mouth, thickness of upper and lower lips, placement of nose (i.e. right nostril), and placement of eyes.” 
        
       
      
    28 Dr Sutisno concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[34] Based wholly and substantially on the above knowledge, it is my opinion that the multiplicity of  
        common morphological features 
        ,  
        unique identifiers 
         and  
        Asian characteristics 
         to  
        lend support 
         that the offender and the alleged suspect Hien TANG are one and the same.” 
        
       
      
    29 It is noticeable from these extracts that the only reference to aspects of the comparison which go beyond the face and head, of the two sets of material being compared, is the reference to “relatively upright posture” in [22] and [23], referred to in the statement as a “unique identifier”. This reflects the more detailed report where under the heading “Summary of the morphological features that have been matched” there were nine characteristics relating to face, cheekbones, jaw, chin, mouth, ears, head and body, of which only one went beyond the face and head and was described in terms only of “posture, upper torso”. The process of photographic superimposition did not involve anything beyond the head and face. 30 Dr Sutisno said that she had adopted a mode of expressing conclusions from an article by MC Bromby “At face value?” (2003) 153 New Law Journal: Expert Witness Supplement 302-304. He advanced six categories:· Level 1: lends no support;· Level 2: lends limited support;· Level 3: lends moderate support;· Level 4: lends support;· Level 5: lends strong support;· Level 6: lends powerful support.31 The article was directed to facial identification only. Nothing in this article supports the expression of an opinion that the person depicted in the two sets of material were one and the same person.32 Dr Sutisno produced two reports in the case of the Appellant. Her first report concluded that there was “limited support”. The second drew the conclusion of “support”. She indicated that she had changed her view in this respect recently. She said that the evidence enabled her to draw a conclusion at a higher level. 33 Dr Sutisno gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Q. What do you mean by limited support or what do you mean by support? 
         
        A. Limited support is, there isn’t enough to suggest they are one and the same person. I made a mistake with the first one, for whatever reason I can’t remember, but previous to coming to court this time round when I was reviewing the material, the results and basically my material, my testimony, I was very surprised towards the end when, I was very surprised that I concluded limited support. I thought no, because that’s not right. Given the number of matches including the unique identifiers including the Asian characteristics and how it was able to be superimposed, there is support there, there is suggestive that, you know, support for me to say yeah it’s one and the same. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. At my request did you, once you’d realised you had made a mistake, you prepared your fresh statement and report? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. You put in your more recent report, lends support. What’s lends support mean when you use it? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A. … [W]hen you have support, lends support or lends strong support or lends powerful support, it noting the evidence as showing that they are one and the same. The difference in the classification is just basically noting the number of angles views available. So the powerful support is more or less relating to the more angle view of the perspective you have. But that doesn’t mean that at the level of lends support that it’s not the same person. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. What is your current opinion? 
         
        A. My current opinion is they are of the same person.” 
        
       
      
    34 In the course of her evidence before the jury, Dr Sutisno outlined her background, qualifications and her approach. As had occurred during the voir dire, the questioning by the Crown Prosecutor referred without distinction to both “facial and body mapping”. No attempt was made to distinguish between the two. The Prosecutor went on to ask detailed questions about morphology which concentrated only on matters of facial form. 35 Dr Sutisno gave evidence applying her technique to the circumstances of the two co-offenders, who were also depicted on the videotape. Although the jury was not informed that the two co-offenders had pleaded guilty, the circumstances of their apprehension 40 minutes after the offence had been committed, in possession of the material found on that occasion, was before the jury. Furthermore, the jury heard evidence that DNA found in the caps worn by the co-offenders confirmed their participation in the robbery. This body of evidence clearly reinforced the evidence which Dr Sutisno gave about the Appellant, and its admission is in issue in this appeal. 36 The detail that Dr Sutisno gave about the facial mapping of the two categories of material about the Appellant was of a different order to that which she provided about body mapping. The same was true about her evidence with respect to the two co-offenders.37 In the case of the two co-offenders she indicated that one had a medium build upper torso and appeared “rather stocky” and was “broad shouldered” with a “physical slouch” (T114). She concluded with respect to that co-offender that the two sets of materials were “of the same person” (T124.47).38 With respect to the body of the second co-offender she said that there was a similar kind of proportion between a longer body and shorter legs but wider shoulders together with a curvature of the shoulders (T128-129) and a “slouching of the shoulders and the upper torso and the … bulkiness of the chest”.  
     
      
      The Trial Judge’s Directions 
      
    39 His Honour had directed the jury on the issue of the expert evidence in the course of Dr Sutisno’s evidence in chief. His Honour then said (T 122): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have determined before you became involved that this particular witness was qualified to give this evidence. It is for you to decide whether you accept her evidence. The fact that she’s extremely well qualified and expresses views based on her qualification and experience and her study does not relieve you of the liability to decide whether or not there is evidence that satisfies you that the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt to be the person in black carrying the gun who was one of the robbers in the shop.” 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour then referred to the evidence then being given by Dr Sutisno with the use of the photo boards and added (T 123): 
     
      
       
        
        “You should understand that she is giving opinions and her opinions - and she’s giving you the process and what it is she looked at and then how she arrived at her opinion. She cannot give you a magnification of the particular photos she looked at. It’s not possible in this Court to do because the equipment is not here.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        This is not unusual with expert witnesses, I have to say. Medical practitioners often give evidence in Court about operations they conduct. It is very rare for video footage to be given of the actual operation. There may be a description of what was done. It is very rare indeed for some film to be shown of precisely how it was done. Engineers give evidence, all sorts of experts give evidence and sometimes they are able to show in exact - very exactly, everything that they did. Other times they can explain a process. They can give examples of what they did and they can show you a process of reasoning.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You then have to evaluate that in the end. It is for you and for you alone to decide whether the accused has been correctly identified. That task is not the doctor’s task. She’s giving you her expert opinion. You must take that into account, but you decide whether you accept it or you reject it in the end.” 
        
       
      
    41 After the evidence had concluded, his Honour provided the jury with written directions which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case in this aspect relies on the identification evidence of Dr Sutisno and fingerprint evidence linking the accused to goods stolen from the premises during the robbery. It is for you to assess the expert evidence and to decide whether you accept it. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You alone decide the facts and no expert, even if highly qualified can take that role away from you. Naturally, you take into account the learning, training and experience of the experts in determining if you accept their opinions. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Dr Sutisno is a witness who has expert qualifications in forensic anatomy. She has a PhD in that field from the University of Sydney. Whilst it is for you to decide if she is an expert and has the qualifications she claims to have, I would direct you that it would be perverse of you to conclude that she is not qualified as she says. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Her evidence is directed to establishing the identities of each of the robbers. Her evidence as to the identities of the other two robbers is supported by other evidence identifying them as the robbers. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The question is whether her evidence identifying the accused as the person, as the robber dressed in black, is correct. You must scrutinise her evidence carefully. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has correctly identified the accused as the robber, you are entitled to find him guilty at the very least of robbery. If you find beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the robbery he had in his possession a dangerous weapon, namely a gun, you should find him guilty of the offence charged.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        If you are not satisfied that her evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is the robber in black that does not conclude the matter, because you must also consider the fingerprint evidence.” 
        
       
      
    42 In his oral directions, his Honour introduced the evidence of Dr Sutisno in the following way (SU 9-10): 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown says it has to assist you with expert evidence of a person who is trained in anatomy and whose speciality is facial and body identification and reconstruction. That is why she is called. She has an expertise in examining faces and bodies and determining whether that person is identical with this person or that person. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You have seen her curriculum vitae. You have been addressed about it by both counsel. You have heard her evidence. You have heard evidence that she has given about getting sculls and building them up into a face. You heard her give evidence she goes to Indonesia and is used to identify bodies, no doubt with other evidence such as DNA evidence. That is her expertise. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The question here is, not is she an expert able to express an opinion? It is a view of the fact, I suppose, that it would be ridiculous, perverse, to come to any conclusion other than the fact that she is an expert. The question is, has she correctly applied her training and experience and knowledge in comparing photographs and going through the processes that she went through to draw the ultimate conclusion that the Accused is the person in black in the store? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now you examine that issue. You must determine the facts in the case. As I say here, it is not just a matter for an expert. If trials were just decided on the basis of expert evidence we would not have juries, we would just call experts and let them decide.” 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour said (SU 11-12): 
     
      
       
        
        “… [I]n determining her evidence you should take into account a number of factors. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Firstly, she has given evidence not merely about the Accused, but about two other men. Two other men were apprehended in a car about an hour after the robbery and were found with goods that links them to the robbery. Amongst those goods were three packets of cigarettes which has the Accused’s fingerprints on them; fingerprints from his left hand. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She has given evidence identifying, using the same process, each of those persons as being the persons in the shop, and has given evidence as to which one is wearing what sort of clothing. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is DNA evidence that links one of the caps to one of them and one of the caps to the other one, and it just so happens that those persons who are linked by DNA evidence to the wearing of those caps are the persons that she says were wearing those caps and wearing those clothes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        So her evidence in relation to those two is supported to some extent by other evidence, DNA evidence, supporting what she says. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Coming then to the Accused, there is no DNA evidence as such supporting what she says. It is purely a question of her expert opinion. She is giving this opinion not as a person used to looking at photographs or comparing faces, but as someone who certainly does those things, but does it from the point of view of a person who is skilled in anatomy. That is, she understands the bony structures underneath the skin. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She uses magnification and various processes to come to her conclusion. She cannot and did not purport to bring a laboratory along here and show you precisely how she did it and with all the equipment that she had. She had a magnifying glass which I think you asked for at one point. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I doubt that it would have assisted terribly much unless your eyes are much better than mine, but she did not say she used that magnifying glass. She had some other sort of equipment, and she described the process of doing it. She says that that enabled her to reach this opinion that it was the Accused who was the man in black. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        As with the other two men, it was not just his face. It was his body type, his racial origin, the way he held himself and other aspects that she considered important. You heard from both counsel the number of points of identification she made. You consider that. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You also must consider, as Ms McSpedden put to you, the fact that she had earlier expressed an opinion, earlier this year, which is much more doubtful about this identification than currently is her opinion. She has given evidence to you as to how she expressed this earlier view and why she expressed the later view. Basically she has said earlier she made a mistake. Her later view is the correct view. In fact she said it is just the way she expressed it rather than a difference of view.” 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour also made reference to the two co-offenders in his summing up in the following way (SU 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that the circumstances point inevitably to those two men, Phuoc Nguyen and Hien Nguyen, being two of the persons who were the robbers. They are found within an hour, they are Asian, they are the same body types that Mr Maqapleh described. They have got some of the objects that appear to be consistent with the objects taken from the store. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The Crown, in relying on circumstantial evidence I suppose, says that the circumstances point inevitably to their being involved, and them not just being two innocent men who just happened to have this material in their car. Their identification with the scene is assisted by the evidence of Dr Sutisno that they indeed were two of the men at the scene. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now how does this all fit in? Well the Crown has also produced evidence about fingerprints. If indeed the packets of cigarettes were those taken from the store, and the Accused’s fingerprints are found on them, that is a circumstance that links him to the robbery. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        So if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances establish that those two men and what they had linked to that robbery, well they were the robbers and this was part of the loot, and the Accused’s fingerprints are on some of the loot, there is a circumstance linking him to the robbery.” 
        
       
      
    45 Although this part of the summing up was directed to the fingerprint evidence in terms, it is pertinent to note what his Honour had said only a few moments before, in the passage already quoted above, about Dr Sutisno’s identification of the co-offenders, when he drew attention to her use of the same methodology in the case of her identification of the Appellant.46 In the course of giving the jury directions on the issue of circumstantial evidence, his Honour said (T 10/12/04 SU 10-12): 
     
      
       
        
        “… [O]n all that circumstantial evidence there is built the evidence of Dr Sutisno, and if you accept her evidence then you should convict. If you are not sure whether you should accept it or not, you should find him not guilty. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You have to look at everything. I think the clearest example of something that could be consistent with guilt or innocence, to give you an example of that circumstantial evidence, is the fingerprint evidence. On its own it could point to either. If, however, the other two men are in the store, you accept that they have been shown to be in the store by a combination of the other circumstantial evidence and Dr Sutisno’s evidence that they were the men in that video, then the men in the video shown to have cigarettes in their possession which were stolen from the store and the accused’s fingerprints are on three of those packets. That would be a combination of circumstantial evidence of the evidence of Dr Sutisno which would entitle you to come to the conclusion that the accused was the third man. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Dr Sutisno’s evidence goes further because she also says he was the third man; just as the other two were there so was he. Now if you don’t accept her evidence then you have got a whole lot of circumstances pointing to suspicion but you haven’t got anything else. You should think long and hard about rejecting the evidence of an expert. It has to be said, of course, it is not like fingerprint technology, it is not something that has been going on for a hundred years, it is a new field and she has given an opinion. Maybe in a hundred years time, like fingerprint evidence, identification of this type will be so common place no one will question it. But anyhow, that is how we put together circumstantial evidence.” 
        
       
      
    47 In response to the jury’s request that they be given a transcript of his Honour’s directions on circumstantial evidence, he indicated that he could not do that but would repeat the circumstantial evidence direction if requested. The foreperson of the jury indicated that the jury wished that to occur. His Honour then proceeded to refer again to the evidence, including the oral evidence of the employee in the convenience store on the night of the robbery and the fingerprint evidence. He referred again to the video evidence involving the two co-accused but warned the jury not to speculate as to why the two co-accused were not on trial in the proceedings before the Appellant. He outlined the evidence about their arrest and what was found in their possession within 40 minutes of the robbery occurring. His Honour then repeated directions about the finding of the Appellant’s fingerprints on the cigarette packets. 48 He then said (T 13/12/04 SU 11-12): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown then puts before you evidence to show that the other two men were in fact the robbers, two of the robbers. Now if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the other two were the robbers then their possession of the bag with the cigarettes in it obviously is a very closely linked circumstance isn’t it. If the Crown establishes they are the robbers and within an hour they are found with items that were taken from the shop, well there is something that is more than just a coincidence, on the Crown case.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now the Crown seeks to prove they are robbers by relying on a number of things. First of all there is the direct evidence of Mr Maqapleh as to their general descriptions. Secondly there is the video evidence of how they stood and looked and walked and so on. And thirdly there is the evidence of Dr Sutisno. Because she says that each of them was in fact one of the people in that store. And she nominates which one is which, which one is wearing this cap and which one is wearing that cap. And in that case her evidence is supported as to the wearing of caps by DNA evidence, which is not disputed, there is no query about it. There is DNA evidence linking each of those two men separately to wearing a particular cap. So obviously they took the cap off and they left traces of themselves inside the cap, as I am sure my DNA is inside this wig. They tested it and they said “right, that man wore that cap - that man wore that cap”. Her evidence using visual comparisons, the way they stood, you may remember her evidence as to one stands with a concave sort of a look about him and one stands in a slightly different way, their physical stature and their faces. She said that man was wearing that clothing in the video and that cap and that man was wearing that clothing, and that man was at the scene and so was that man. That is expert evidence and of course it is based on a number of things. First of all photographs were taken of both of them. You have seen the photographs. She describes what the photographs mean to her, as to how they were standing and looking and so on. Well you take into account what she has said. If she has in fact established to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that those two men were two of the robbers then that evidence supports the circumstantial evidence pointing to that and the circumstantial evidence pointing to that is the evidence of them being found with the cigarettes in the bag and the other things in that bag within an hour and wearing these particular clothing. Throwing the baseball caps in the back of the car, everything they did at the time. All that circumstantial evidence points to their involvement. If you accept Dr Sutisno’s evidence, that involvement which is pointed to by the circumstances, is established by her evidence. Now if her evidence does establish that they were, to your satisfaction and beyond reasonable doubt that they were two of the people at the scene, then those two people at the scene had in their possession a bag with cigarettes in it that were stolen at the scene and on which there were the fingerprints of the Accused, he has left fingerprints. The Crown then says, look at the video. How was the man with the gun, the man wearing the dark clothes, putting cigarettes in the bag. He was putting them in with his left hand. That is the explanation about how his left fingerprints got onto those packets. If you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those two men were shown to be the robbers and they have in their possession with some of the stolen objects in it and his left fingerprints on those packets, there is circumstantial evidence linking him to the robber as the third man.” 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour then went on to say (SU 14-17): 
     
      
       
        
        “We have established to your satisfaction, says the Crown, that those two men were the robbers. We now wish to establish to your satisfaction that he also was the third man, the man in black and the man with the gun. Now, the photographs of him that were used to compare were obviously taken nine months afterwards, not on the night, because he was not arrested on the night. There was no DNA evidence to link him to any item of clothing because no-one could suggest that when he was arrested he was wearing the same clothing as the person in the shop on the night. So it then gets down to, really, Dr Sutisno’s science. Has she proved to you beyond reasonable doubt, or rather, has the Crown. She does not have to prove anything she is only a witness. Has the Crown proved to you beyond reasonable doubt that her evidence to you that that man in black is the Accused is correct? Because if the Crown has proved that, then the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It does not rely just on the circumstances, it does not rely just on the other two men were there and his fingerprints were in the bag. It relies on something more- direct, scientific evidence, scientific evidence that says: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘I have measured his face. I have looked at it, using equipment that I have access to but which you the jury do not have access to. I am a trained anatomist, I know all the bone structures underneath the skin, I reconstructed faces from skulls, I often identify people who are dead, using this process and I say that the man in black, shown in that video, is the same man as the man in these photographs. That man is the Accused.’  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now if the Crown establishes that, beyond reasonable doubt, then the Crown has proved its case. If you have some doubts about that particular aspect, you still have to consider if you are satisfied she has already established the identity of the other two men, you still have to consider whether, because of the circumstantial evidence in the case, and the proof that the other two men were there, taking into account his explanation, you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the Crown has proved the case anyway. So there are different levels in a sense in which you are asked to look at the case. You have to decide yourself whether you accept Dr Sutisno’s evidence or you reject it or you are not certain about it. If you are certain about it in relation to the identification of the other two men you can of course then look at that fact when assessing how certain are you of it in relation to the Accused. You may want to look at it globally, that is, all three at once. You may say that is not a process that appeals to you just looking at this bit and then that bit, you want to look at the whole thing. Now if you are satisfied, it comes down to this. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what she has said accurately identifies the accused as the man in black with the gun then you should find him guilty. If you have doubts about that then you must consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Crown has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, even if you are highly suspicious about the matter, you must find the Accused not guilty. If you totally reject Dr Sutisno’s evidence, you think it is unreliable, you do not like it, then of course you must find the Accused not guilty because there would be nothing to show the other two men were there, beyond reasonable doubt and the circumstances of a fingerprint in a bag would not be sufficient on its own, without more to prove the Accused was there and a robber.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        So a great deal depends on Dr Sutisno but all the other circumstances come into play. Her science operates on what she has given. She was not there, she is not giving direct evidence of what she saw. She is saying I am asked to compare what I can tell of a person’s body shape, size, face, lips, prominent features, with something seen in a video. I look at this and I look at this and I do my comparisons. I consider the anatomy of it and I come to this conclusion. Now you are not required to accept her conclusion. There is no requirement that a jury must accept an expert’s conclusion. An expert is like any other witness, the evidence has to be evaluated by you the jury. If you consider she has sufficiently established the identity of each of these three men then it must follow, I would have thought, that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. If you are satisfied she has established the identity of two of them, you have then got to look at the circumstances of how the fingerprints got into that bag, onto those cigarette packets. Do the circumstances point inevitably to guilt or could they point to some innocent explanation. If you think they point inevitably to guilt - you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that, well again you are entitled to convict him whether or not you then want to go on and consider whether Dr Sutisno accurately identified him.” 
        
       
      
    50 During the course of the jury’s deliberations, they formulated a question as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accepting Dr Sutisno’s qualifications should we therefore accept her methodology?” 
        
       
      
    51 The Crown asserted, and the person then representing the Appellant, who was not trial counsel, agreed that there was no challenge to her methodology during the trial but only to her conclusions. 52 His Honour told the jury (on 13/12/04 SU 20-22): 
     
      
       
        
        “Well first of all can I say this, that during the course of the trial Dr Sutisno was asked many questions, the attack that was made upon when if one call it that what the accused counsel put to her, seemed to be concerned, and you’ve got the transcript so you can look at this yourself, only with the conclusion she drew concerning the accused. Nothing was suggested to her that the method she chose when doing her work were erroneous. Nothing was put to her to suggest that the approach she took was untenable or wrong. Nothing was put to suggest that her conclusions in relation to the other two persons Phuoc Nguyen and Hai Nguyen were wrong. Nothing was put to suggest that the way in which she approached the conclusions in relation to the accused were wrong as such, rather she was attacked for the conclusions she drew.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Now she, you might think caused some complications herself by referring to the fact that in an earlier - she apparently did a couple of reports on this. Now we have not seen these reports they have not been tendered, so this only comes from questions that were asked of her by the Crown Prosecutor and by defence counsel. But it would appear she did a couple of reports presumably to the Crown the prosecuting authority. And in the first of these reports she claimed in relation only to the accused, not in relation to the other two men, in respect of whom she also did reports. But in relation to him she said what she had gave limited support and what she looked at gave limited support to his being the person in the store.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        She then said that she reviewed those conclusions and came to the conclusion that was wrong. She said that there was a sort of scale of six levels of support and in her second report she said that her investigations lent support to his being the person, and she in fact was of the opinion he was the person.” 
        
       
      
    53 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But the essence of her evidence you might think is this and I invite you go and read it all again for yourselves because you’ve got the whole lot of it. But the essence of her evidence comes does to this, she is an expert in forensic anatomy, she has developed a method of doing things, she is now in the process of patenting that method. Other people have expressed views over the years and she’s taken into account their views including Mr Bromby’s views. But she’s developed her own method of doing it, she is in the process of patenting it because no else has had this same method. And she then expresses her views as being certain views but acknowledges that on an earlier occasion in relation to her consideration of this accused she expressed her views in a way that were much less definite. She still expressed the opinion they were the same person but the reasoning process was less definite. She says it was a mistake and she’s now definite.” 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You can accept her qualifications and you can still reject her evidence if you honestly consider you should. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I’m not urging you to reject her evidence. I express an opinion as an opinion of fact and you’re entirely entitled to disregard it if you wish - But if a person is appropriately qualified and expresses opinions within that appropriate field and those opinions are not seriously in doubt, then perhaps considerable caution should be exercised before you’d reject that person’s evidence. Nevertheless, in the end you must decide whether you accept or you reject it or whether you are just not sure whether you should one way or the other. If you’re not sure one way or the other then you might come to the conclusion you should find the accused not guilty. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        But if you accept her evidence in relation to the other two men, - again I express an opinion, that you’re entitled to disagree with if you accept that in relation to the other two men she identified them correctly. And I tell you that if you look at the evidence that it was never suggested to her that, that identification was wrong, you should think carefully before rejecting her evidence about the accused. If you accept it in relation to the other two it might seem illogical not to accept it in relation the accused, you should think carefully about that issue.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The Evidence of Specialised Knowledge 
      
    55 The admissibility of Dr Sutisno’s opinion evidence turns on the application to her of s79 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “79 If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s, training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.” 
        
       
      
    56 In the present case there were certificates, relevant to each of the three offenders, in compliance with s177 of the Evidence Act, which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “177(1) Evidence of a person’s opinion may be adduced by tendering a certificate (expert’s certificate) signed by the person that; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) states the person’s name and address; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) states that the person has specialised knowledge based on his or her training, study or experience as specified in the certificate; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) sets out an opinion that the person holds and that is expressed to be wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.” 
        
       
      
    57 The opinion evidence in the present case had two quite distinct dimensions. The first was concerned with identification of the Appellant as the person in the videotape on the basis of facial characteristics, referred to in the case as “facial mapping”. The second dimension concerns the identification of the Appellant as the person in the videotape on the basis of physical characteristics of other parts of his body and of posture, referred to as “body mapping”. The evidence about specialised knowledge with respect to the latter is of a qualitatively different character to that relating to the former. 58 In each expert certificate under s177 of the Act, Dr Sutisno identified her area of expertise as a Forensic Anatomist specialising in Facial Identification. This is reinforced by her formal research. Her Honours thesis for a Bachelor of Science degree, in which she graduated with Honours in Forensic Anatomy in 1994, was on the subject: “An assessment of two methods of facial reconstruction”. Her PhD thesis at the University of Sydney was entitled: “Human facial soft tissue thickness and its value in forensic facial reconstruction”.59 Each of the original expert certificates under s177 of the Evidence Act had annexed to it a form of curriculum vitae which was not tendentious. It identified her as Forensic Anatomist with an Expertise of Facial Identification, under which the following particulars appeared:· Facial identification using surveillance images;· Facial reconstruction from the skull;· Determination of age, race and sex of human remains;· Casting bones and fossils.60 This curriculum vitae went on to outline her educational background, her theses, various awards, grants and scholarships, professional memberships and her employment history, including her role as an expert witness which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1998-2000 Forensic Anatomist (Freelance) Department of Forensic Medicine, Glebe 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Expertise: Assist Police with identifying suspects from surveillance images and individuals from their skeleton remains. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2002-current Consultant Forensic Anatomist 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Facial Identification Expert 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Particularly expertise using video surveillance, images, face reconstruction from the skull, determination of age, race and sex of human remains, duplicating bones and fossils.” 
        
       
      
    61 Examples of cases conducted for Police were two in each of 1994 and 1997 on the subject of “Face reconstruction from skulls” and six between 1998 and 2002 on the subject of “Face Identification from surveillance images”. 62 Reference was also made to a number of presentations, conferences, seminars and media interviews. There were no entries after 2003.63 During the trial there was tendered before the jury a different form of curriculum vitae, which updated information until 2004. Much of the information as to basic qualifications and presentations was the same, subject to updating. However, the nature of her expertise was set out in a different manner. There was no restriction of the area of expertise of the character that appeared in the original Expert Certificates to “Facial Identification”. Four separate “specialities” were identified in the following order:· Speciality 1: Face and Body Mapping;· Speciality 2: Facial Reconstruction;· Speciality 3: Human Remains Identification;· Speciality 4: Bones and Fossils Reproductions.64 Speciality 1 was described in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Suspects’ identification from surveillance evidence using principles of visual biometrics and morphological assessments of the face, head and body.” 
        
       
      
    65 Under this heading, a number of cases were identified, including each of the cases previously described in the former curriculum vitae as cases of “face identification”. To this was added a range of cases in the years 2003 and 2004, including the present case. All of these cases were described in terms of the location of the offence and the particular branch of the police force which obtained her assistance.66 Dr Sutisno produced an Expert Certificate with respect to the Appellant dated 27 February 2004. The final Certificate was dated 30 November 2004, being the date of the voir dire. It is sufficient to concentrate on this Certificate in its final form for purposes of this appeal. It was to this final Certificate to which Dr Sutisno appended what she described as the “updated curriculum vitae”, to which I have referred above. 67 The addition of “body mapping” to “facial mapping” is of significance. During the voir dire examination, when Dr Sutisno was explaining why she had upgraded her opinion from “lends limited support” in her February Certificate, to “lends support”, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now what I’ve experienced since that time and now I realise posture and discussions with other experts posture is quite a big unique identifier, because it’s habitual and it’s what we were born with or what our environment has – as in if we’re you know a sports person, so I mean its habitual, and it’s individual. So I wasn’t aware at the time that posture does have such a great weight.” 
        
       
      
    68 In this Certificate Dr Sutisno asserted that she was a Forensic Anatomy expert with speciality in Facial Identification and added the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Training 
        : My Honours and PhD research provided training in Facial Reconstruction from the skull, and Face and Body Mapping for suspect’s identification from surveillance evidence. I am also skilled in the following: forensic osteology, statistical data analyses, archaeological/anthropological excavation, sculpting, photography, visual graphics software (eg FACE, Adobe Photoshop), and bones and fossils reproductions. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Experiences 
        : I have given lectures, presentations, seminars, interviews and workshops in Australia and abroad on forensic anatomy and related areas. I have assisted exhumations for forensic, historical or archaeological purpose. I have assisted Police to identify suspects from surveillance evidence ( 
        Face & Body Mapping 
        ) or anonyms from their skull ( 
        Facial Reconstruction 
        ).” 
        
       
      
    69 Under the heading “Face and Body Mapping” the Certificate set out:

        Appendices B and C 
         for technical information.” 
        
       
      
    70 Appendix B to the Report was entitled “Morphological Analysis”, which is described in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Morphological analysis is the feature-by-feature approach to evaluate faces as used by the 19th and 20th Century anthropologists. The technique is better known today as  
        Visual Biometric Analysis 
         or  
        Facial Mapping 
         (Bromby 2003). It involves the ‘comparison of two images – one from the crime scene, and one obtained of the suspect’ (Bromby 2003: 302). In the past decade, the method has enabled experts in the United States (Iscan 1993; Halberstein 2001), United Kingdom (Bromby 2003), Japan, Malaysia (Hashimoto 2000), and Australia (Porter and Doran 2000; Sutisno PhD Thesis 2003) to produce reports to provide identification evidence, principally in criminal cases. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The philosophy behind the method is to ‘subdivide the face into components to obtain a thorough analysis’ (Iscan 1993: 58) and determine absolute visual similarities. This qualitative assessment prevents ‘complications arising from perspective and the distance from the camera to the subject’ and/or ‘the need for complicated statistical matching of population samples and thorny issues of probability’ (Bromby 2003: 302). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Generally for the images to be of comparative use, the ‘heads of the subjects must be of the same angle’ (Bromby 2003: 302). Furthermore, ‘the images can be cropped or scaled to allow the comparisons to be made’ ( 
        ibid 
        ). To assist with the analysis is a set of standards covering an entire range of examinable morphological characteristics of the head and facial features (eg Table 1). These standards have been ‘designed to make individual variation and population differences emerge from a seemingly unremarkable visage’ and thus guide ‘the expert in making a decision about the viability of the match’ (Iscan 1993: 58). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It is crucial to include the most noticeable features when selecting the standards. The addition of any deviations from the ‘norm’ such as disproportionately large nose or protruding ears can prove very useful as it creates distinctive appearances. Furthermore, the analysis commonly involves multiple comparisons of images taken from different angles. It is important to note relative similarities and/or differences between the images as well as the presence of any distinguishing ‘ 
        unique identifiers 
        ’ that would strongly support that the two people are likely to be one and the same.” 
        
       
      
    71 This Appendix also outlined in both written and graphic form the kinds of differences that can exist amongst different facial features, which is unnecessary to set out, it is pertinent to note that none of these referred to differences in body types or posture. The evidence was limited to the face and head of a person. 72 Appendix C was entitled “Photographic Superimposition”. It stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Photographic Superimposition 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Photographic Superimposition is a process of overlaying ‘two comparably enlarged’ images to ‘determine if facial features and dimensions can be correctly superimposed on each other’ (Iscan 1993: 67). It can be achieved through the use of either video or computer technology. The ‘video or computer system allows the expert to develop and demonstrate a series of visual effects and to focus on morphological details and [dimensions]’ and enable the viewers to ‘see the entire procedure and visualize exactly how the expert came to his or her conclusions’ (Iscan 1993: 68). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Using a computer system photo-to-photo superimposition is possible using Adobe Photoshop software. The first step would be to select the surveillance image and forensic photograph or similar tilt, roll and yaw of the head, and digitally transfer them to one canvas. Position the image and photograph side-by-side, crop and scale to achieve a size of one to one proportion. Using the  
        opacity 
         tool, reduce the transparency of the forensic photograph in the range of 30-50%. Using the  
        move 
         tool, move the forensic photograph and place it over the surveillance image to see if the facial features and dimensions are different or of a perfect match. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The superimposition can be visually displayed on hard copies by printing the surveillance image on high quality photo paper and the forensic photograph on a transparency film. The would allow the viewers to see the alignment of morphological features in form and dimensions by flipping the forensic photograph over the surveillance image. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Photo-to-photo superimposition is only possible with images of identical pose (Bromby 2003; Iscan 1993; Maat 1989). To maintain scientific objectivity the images are required to be of one to one proportion. Identification should not be based on this method alone. The method is most useful when coupled with the results of Morphological Analysis or Photo-Anthropometric Assessment to highlight and demonstrate important areas where there are marked differences or perfect matches.

    73 Dr Sutisno gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In order to do this comparative morphological study between photographs does that require any understanding of anatomy? 
         
        A. Greatly, yes. You need to know how the underlying bone gives rise to the overlying flesh, because how we appear in life and when we’re alive with our flesh and muscles and so forth, that is given rise by the formation of our bone. That’s why, for example, with a Caucasian with the protruding nose you can read that from the bone as opposed to an Asian with more flatter nose. So there’s this co-relationship between - or interrelationship between the bone as an underlying architecture that holds the surface, the gross dimensions of the face.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And when you’re talking about that, is that, for example where you’ve done facial reconstructions and building up from a skull and trying to work out what the person would have looked like? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. You have consideration to individual features on the skull, such as where the nose opening is, or an eye socket? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And to you, as someone who is trained in this area, for example a particular eye socket in a skull will indicate to you what sort of fleshy skin and muscle would have been around the eye and how, for example, deeply set an eye would have been? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. So when you are doing this morphological comparative study, is what you’re doing not only looking at what you can see by way of the skin but you’re in fact forming an assessment of, I look at the skin, I know what the muscle is underneath, I know where the bone is underneath? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And then you are thinking about the underlying anatomy when you’re comparing the two photos? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    74 After a luncheon adjournment during the course of Dr Sutisno’s evidence in chief, the jury asked the following pertinent, indeed perspicacious, questions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Was there any photo anthropometry performed in comparing the surveillance images and forensic photos of the accused, what were the results. How accurate is morphology analysis as a technique? What percentage of cases are correct matches of persons versus incorrect matches? Could we please ask Dr Sutisno how many matching morphological features she needs to form the opinion that two photos are the same person, what would be the minimum?” 
        
       
      
    75 This led to the following evidence being given, over objection, in the presence of the jury (T 138-139): 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Dr Sutisno just in relation to one of the questions asked by the jury about the number of matches required, is there any set number of comparable feature matches that you require before you make a conclusion that you’re identifying the same person in two different photos? 
         
        A. Not in that sense because it’s not a match of quantity, it’s a match of quality. Whether you have a lot of points but yet none of them uniquely or distinctly characterises that person it would weigh less than if you only have a small number of points but yet those are strong points, they are unique identifiers. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And is that something that you do in looking at the product, you look at the quality of the product and the quality of the comparative features? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: … [H]ow accurate is morphology analysis as a technique, are you able to answer that? 
         
        A. Yes. From my experience and from what I’ve studied I believe it can be fairly accurate in narrowing it down to whether or not they are one and the same person. Mainly because as I said, unlike just looking at the dimensions or proportion which some people may be similar but looking at the characteristics and habits, things that are generated individually as a person then more or less it tends to be more accurate than the previous one and as-- 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. What was the previous one? 
         
        A. The photo anthropometry.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Which is, just explain that again? 
         
        A. Which is just comparing the dimensions, measurements and proportions. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Of two photos? 
         
        A. Yes, of two faces. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Two faces? 
         
        A. Yeah. Usually that’s only of faces, not the rest of the body. In terms of morphology and the way I conduct it it’s more accurate in the sense that it gives you a more broader field of features to look at and not only just the features of the face, the body, that everyone can see such as the eyes, the nose and the mouth and so forth which you think well everybody has those, what’s so different about that person to another, but it’s the addition of those unique identifiers or distinctive characteristics which if you’re trained to look at - okay, this is because of the way they walk or the way they hold themselves, for whatever reason, whether they have a paralysis, whether they have deformities, you know, things that narrows it down and individualise the person and something that a lay person would then use as a point of recognition.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Now have there been any studies to indicate the percentage of cases where the matches are correct as opposed to incorrect? 
         
        A. From the literature that I have read in terms of looking at morphology they’ve always been more correct than - to identify a person than just looking at the measurements. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. That’s as far as you can go with that question, would that be right? 
         
        A. Yes and from-- 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. You say it’s more likely to be correct than merely looking at somebody’s features and measuring? 
         
        A. Mm mm - I don’t understand, what do you mean?  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Well the anthropometry is looking at somebody’s facial features and measuring it-- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. --and comparing it with another photograph and measuring the facial features there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. What you’re saying is morphology produces more correct answers in your opinion from that method? 
         
        A. Yes and that is supported in the literature as well.” 
        
       
      
    76 She then gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. You just mentioned then that in relation to morphology you believe it to be fairly accurate? 
         
        A. Well, enough to be able to provide in results that would be sufficient to show that there are matches or no matches. Basically to show that they are of the same person or disprove it altogether and say that they’re not of the same person.” 
        
       
      
    77 After she had completed her evidence, Dr Sutisno was given permission to add to her earlier answer about the accuracy of her technology. She said (T201): 
     
      
       
        
        “A. … my answer to you that it was fairly accurate was based on the literature of other experts. Now from my own opinion and experience and especially at the recent Jakarta bombing that I was called to in Indonesia, I find that with the innovative system of analysis that I apply is very accurate. It has been supported by DNA results …” 
        
       
      
    78 During the course of her cross-examination, Dr Sutisno rejected the suggestion that there was a degree of subjectivity in her assessment (T188.1-14). She said, more than once, that she had followed a “strict protocol” (T188.1-14). She acknowledged that this “protocol” had been developed by herself (T191.25).79 The following important evidence was given: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is that protocol something that has been assessed and put up to your peers for review? 
         
        A. It has been assessed and accepted through my PhD thesis. As to publication, I’ve been advised not to publish yet because I’m in the process of patenting my innovations.” 
        
       
      
    80 As noted above, her PhD thesis was on the subject of forensic facial reconstruction. 81 In re-examination she gave the following evidence (T200): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you made the protocol did you rely on anything to set the parameters of the protocol? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. What did you rely on? 
         
        A. I relied on my experiments and the studies that I had to conduct, and as well on the field experiences. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Are field experiences your experiences or other experiences? 
         
        A. Both. Well mainly mine personally, because it’s an innovation which I was developing, but knowing the limitation which other experts in the field have.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Issues on Appeal 
      
    82 The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour the learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Doctor Sutisno concerning the Appellant: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) generally, either because it was not evidence of opinion based on recognised and testable body of reliable scientific or specialised knowledge, training, study or experience or because it was a subjective opinion and that there was no means of determining objectively whether the opinion was justified or based wholly or substantially on such a body of knowledge; 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) generally in the exercise of discretion because the evidence was vague, could not be tested, and was presented in a manner and form which gave rise to a high degree of unfair prejudice to the Appellant the danger of which outweighed its probative value, or because it was misleading and confusing and unfairly prejudicial to the Appellant as result of the way in which it was presented to the jury. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in admitting the Doctor’s Curriculum Vitae (Exhibit C19). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Doctor Sutisno concerning purported ‘identification’ of the co-accused Hai Dang Nguyen and Quoc Nguyen in the trial of the Appellant. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4. His Honour erred in his directions to the jury in relation to the witness Doctor Sutisno on 2 December 2004. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        5. His Honour erred in asking Doctor Sutisno for her own assessment of the accuracy of her analysis, and further examining the Doctor on issues related to jury questions asked on 2 December 2004.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        6. His Honour erred in his directions to the jury in relation to the witness Doctor Sutisno in his summing up. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        7. The verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    83 At common law there is a distinction between evidence of resemblance and evidence of identification. (See R v Murphy (1994) 62 SASR 121 at 123-124; Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [10]-[11]; Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 69 ALJR 612 at 614 and 615-616.) Evidence of similarity may be relevant and admissible as part of a circumstantial case. There was no suggestion on this appeal that evidence of this character was not admissible. 84 It could not be said that the quality of the videotape and the stills taken from the videotape were such that Dr Sutisno was in no better position than the jury to compare the two sets of material. I do not intend to suggest that this is a requirement of admissibility under s79, but this was a case which fell within observations of the joint judgment in Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650 at [15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In other cases, the evidence of identification will be relevant because it goes to an issue about the presence or absence of some identifying feature other than one apparent from observing the accused on trial and the photograph which is said to depict the accused … If it is suggested that there is some distinctive feature revealed by the photographs (as, for example, a manner of walking) which would not be apparent to the jury in court, evidence both of that fact and the witnesses’ conclusions of identity would not be irrelevant. …” 
        
       
      
    85 In the present case, as his Honour held in his judgment on the voir dire, features displayed on the videotape or on the stills taken from the videotape were not such as the jury could themselves make a comparison. The process of computer enhancement and magnification of the images and the detailed comparison with undisputed photographic images of the Appellant, was evidence of similarity that was, in my opinion, relevant and admissible. Mr M Ramage QC, who appeared for the Appellant, did not suggest that this part of Dr Sutisno’s evidence was inadmissible.86 I should note that the Evidence Act contains a definition of “identification evidence” which includes evidence of resemblance. However, it was not suggested, either at trial or on appeal, that Pt 3.9 of the Evidence Act applied to the circumstances of this case.87 The grounds of appeal focus particular attention on the admissibility of the opinions expressed in the evidence and also on the quality of that evidence. It appears to me that there are three distinct pieces of opinion evidence given by Dr Sutisno with respect to the Appellant. These are: 
     
      
      (i) Dr Sutisno’s evidence that the two bodies of photographs depict the same person; 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) Dr Sutisno’s evidence that, on the six point scale she applied to the photographic evidence, “the similarities” did “lend support” to the conclusion that the offender and the Appellant were one and the same person; 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) Dr Sutisno’s characterisation of certain matters as “unique identifiers”. 
      
    88 The evidence of identity referred to in (i) is plainly an opinion. The “six point scale” in (ii) is derived from Bromby and has no scientific basis. It is no more than a series of convenient labels, arranged in an ascending hierarchy, that state a conclusion. As to (iii) the categorisation of an “identifier” as “unique” similarly has no scientific basis and is no more than an emphatic statement of an opinion.89 It is convenient to defer consideration of the grounds of appeal which are directed to this opinion evidence and deal with a number of the more specific grounds of appeal first. 
     
      
      Admission of the Curriculum Vitae 
      
    90 I have set out above the pertinent passages of the doctor’s “updated” curriculum vitae. At the trial an objection was taken to the document on the basis that it was more in the form of an advertising blurb than a curriculum vitae. On the appeal the Appellant submitted that the assertions of accuracy contained in the document were not appropriate for presentation as evidence and were unduly prejudicial to the Appellant. 91 The objection taken at trial was raised in advance by counsel for the Appellant in the absence of the jury. On the appeal the Crown said that subsequently, when the curriculum vitae was actually tendered, no further objection was put on the record at that stage. The Crown relied on rule 4. In my opinion rule 4 cannot be said to apply. A clear objection and a clear ruling were made at trial. 92 Some aspects of the curriculum vitae were tendentious, particularly the assertion of “Speciality 1” and its detailed description, which I have set out above. Nevertheless, these aspects of the curriculum vitae were open to cross-examination with the suggestion that Dr Sutisno was exaggerating her skills and technique in order to obtain additional work as a forensic expert. In cross-examination she was asked whether, save on one occasion, she had always been called by the prosecution and that, as her evidence had never before been admitted before a jury, she had a desire to have it admitted on this occasion (T 199). Although she was not cross-examined on her curriculum vitae as such, in the course of final address, counsel for the accused drew attention to the curriculum vitae, described it in disparaging terms and submitted that it lent support to the proposition that “the doctor was a little over keen to establish her credibility to you” (T 290). By the stage of addresses, of course, the objection had been overruled. Nevertheless it indicates the use to which a document of this character can properly be put.93 In the submissions in this Court no particular aspect of the curriculum vitae was identified as causing unfair prejudice. I can detect none. I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
      Directions as to the Ultimate Issue 
      
    94 As set out above, his Honour gave some directions to the jury during the course of Dr Sutisno’s evidence in chief. In addition to those observations, during the course of this part of the trial, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The doctor is giving an opinion, the opinion is in the sense an opinion about the ultimate issue in the case. But only you the jury can decide that ultimate question. If it were otherwise we wouldn’t have juries we’d just call experts and get opinions and that would be the end of it. And that is not the system at all. The system is you decide, you look at the witness.” 
        
       
      
    95 Ground 4 is directed to this passage in his Honour’s directions. The objection taken on appeal is the use of the terminology “ultimate issue” in this direction. The Appellant submitted that, at this stage of her evidence, Dr Sutisno had not in fact given the evidence that the Appellant was the same person as the person depicted in the videotape of the offence. That evidence came later.96 There had been such evidence during the voir dire. Although her written report had used the language of “lends support”, Dr Sutisno had answered a question from his Honour about “how certain” she was that it was “the same man”, by adopting his Honour’s terminology that “the two people are one and the same” (T VD 9 ll 24-29). His Honour referred to this evidence in his judgment on the voir dire (at p5.9). It was this evidence which the Crown Prosecutor no doubt thought helpful and, subsequently, adduced before the jury.97 The words “the ultimate issue” would be understood by lawyers, in the circumstances of this case, to refer to the identification of the Appellant as the person depicted in the videotape. It is by no means clear to me what a jury would have understood the words to mean that at the time the directions were given. In any event, as Dr Sutisno did eventually give the evidence of identity, I can see no miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
      Expert Evidence About Co-accused 
      
    98 Ground 3 is that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of Dr Sutisno about the two offenders who pleaded guilty. The Appellant submits that the evidence was irrelevant. The Appellant also submits that the principal effect of this evidence was to give unjustified weight to the evidence of Dr Sutisno. 99 The Crown submits, correctly in my opinion, that evidence to establish that the two persons identified were in fact two of the three co-offenders displayed on the videotape was relevant. It was a significant part of the case against the Appellant that his fingerprints were found on cigarette packets in their possession. Moreover he had, on his own admission, been in their company within 40 minutes of the offence occurring. He gave an innocent explanation as to his presence on that occasion. Nevertheless the link was an important one in the case. Accordingly, it was relevant for the Crown to establish that the two other persons were in fact two of the offenders displayed on the videotape.100 The other evidence admitted in these proceedings included evidence of the time and circumstances of their apprehension, the goods which were found in their possession, together with the baseball caps linked to them by DNA evidence and which matched the caps of the other two offenders displayed on the video. Dr Sutisno’s evidence also inculpated the two co-offenders. Plainly there were other ways of proving their guilt. Nevertheless, the Crown is not restricted from establishing the fact that the two persons were in fact offenders in a particular way, merely because there is other cogent evidence. 101 One way that the problem could have been averted was if the fact of their pleas of guilty had been before the jury. Indeed, Ms McSpedden in the course of the voir dire indicated that the Appellant was not in a position to dispute the assertion that they were the other two offenders (T VD p14 lines 51-56). The Crown was under no obligation to take up this offer and the matter does not seem to have been raised again.102 When Dr Sutisno’s evidence about the co-offenders came to be tendered before the jury there was no objection to the tender. Rule 4 applies. It may be that counsel for the Appellant at trial assumed that his Honour’s ruling on the admissibility of Dr Sutisno’s evidence with respect to the Appellant would determine this issue. However, that would only be the case on the general question of admissibility of opinions of this character, which I will discuss further below. On the question of the discretion to exclude evidence, most relevantly under s137 of the Evidence Act, quite distinct considerations arose with respect to Dr Sutisno’s evidence about the two co-accused.103 Whether or not this evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the accused had to be assessed in a context where there was no real issue about the fact that the other two persons were two of the three offenders. The strength of the circumstantial case against the two offenders, even without a formal admission that they had pleaded guilty, was considerable. The impact on the trial of the Appellant was to provide considerable, direct reinforcement of the validity of Dr Sutisno’s methodology. 104 As the extracts from the summing-up set out above indicate, his Honour made numerous, explicit references linking the evidence against the two undisputed co-offenders, as supported by other evidence establishing their participation in the crime, to Dr Sutisno’s evidence about the Appellant. The scepticism implicit in some of the jury’s questions may very well have been substantially allayed by this direct reinforcement of Dr Sutisno’s methodology and expertise. A real case of unfair prejudice could have been mounted at trial. It was not. Accordingly, as the Crown submits, r 4 applies. 105 The trial judge was never called upon to make the judgment for which s137, or for that matter s135, calls with respect to the admissibility of the evidence of Dr Sutisno concerning the two co-offenders. No doubt for that reason, no submission has been made that his Honour erred in any respect in this regard. Nor has any submission been made that this Court should make any such judgment for the first time. This matter can be revisited in any new trial. On the basis of the submissions made in this Court, in my opinion, r 4 should be applied and leave to argue Ground 3 should be refused.  
     
      
      The Jury Question 
      
    106 Ground 5 turns on the intelligent question posed by the jury which led to a series of questions, including some by his Honour. The question and the passage from the transcript are fully set out in [74]-[75] above. The questioning arising from the jury’s note was primarily pursued by the Crown Prosecutor. The ground of appeal relates only to a question by the trial judge.107 The Appellant submits that the question posed by his Honour to the witness was “not a response to the jury’s question nor did they address the issue that the jury note indicated”. This submission should be rejected. The question that was asked and answered was “How accurate is morphology analysis as a technique?”. That was precisely the second sentence of the jury note. It could not be suggested that his Honour had impermissibly descended into the arena by putting to the witness in terms a question that had been posed by the jury. 108 The second submission made in support of this ground was that the question invited a self-serving answer. There is no doubt that the answer that was given was self-serving. It amounted to no more than a statement that Dr Sutisno believed it was accurate, without any supporting material beyond her assertion. As noted above at [77], at the end of her evidence, Dr Sutisno was given leave to strengthen her evidence by replacing the words “fairly accurate” with the words “very accurate”. However, no objection was taken on appeal to this evidence. 109 Although the question did receive an entirely self-serving answer, it did not, in terms, invite such an answer. It was put in a manner which could have led to Dr Sutisno outlining such evidence of an objective character as may exist in support of a technique she purported to apply. That that was not forthcoming in any shape, manner or form would no doubt have been noticed by a jury that asked so pertinent and perspicacious a question. In any event the question as posed was relevant and did not necessitate an answer of the inadequate character which it received. 110 Ground 5 should be rejected.  
     
      
      The Trial Judge’s Directions 
      
    111 The Appellant submitted that the trial judge’s directions to the jury were confusing and unhelpful and on occasions contradictory. The submissions did not, however, descend to any level of particularity with respect to this proposition, save in two respects to which I will refer.112 One matter said to manifest “confusion” was his Honour’s reference, which this submission itself states was quite quickly retracted, that Dr Sutisno had to prove the Crown’s case beyond reasonable doubt. It appeared in the following passage at SU 14: 
     
      
       
        
        “So it gets down to, really, Dr Sutisno’s science. Has she proved to you beyond reasonable doubt, or rather, has the Crown. She does not have to prove anything. She’s only a witness. Has the Crown proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence to you that the man in black is the accused is correct.” 
        
       
      
    113 This was a minor and transient slip not manifesting any level of confusion, let alone any other inadequacy.114 The only other example given in the Appellant’s submissions was what was said to be “confusion” when the jury asked the question, that I have set out at [50] above, as to whether or not they had to accept Dr Sutisno’s methodology. The submission of the Appellant is that his Honour in some way erred in stating to the jury that Dr Sutisno’s methodology had not been challenged. However, the statement was made after that very proposition had been agreed to by the person at that time representing the Appellant. (See [51]-[52].)115 It may have been true, as the Appellant submits, that if trial counsel had been present at this particular moment she may have taken a different view. It is the case that in oral submissions trial counsel questioned the validity of the protocol. The Appellant in written submissions states that there was, in fact, a challenge to the way in which Dr Sutisno had developed what was referred to as the “Bromby Scale” in expressing her opinion. No doubt, this was a reference to her evidence that the two categories of photographs were of the same person.116 The passage in the oral submissions of trial counsel which refer to this matter is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “You might agree with the doctor that the comparison of the two and the features that are similar lend support to the proposition that the thief could be the accused. Lends support. But on a true valuation of the evidence and truly taking into account what the doctor says, and the limitations on the material that she had to make her analysis upon, and the limitations in her technique, protocol that’s not apparently shared by anyone else operating in this field, you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    117 What his Honour did say to the jury was in accordance with what the person at that point representing the Appellant had acknowledged. It does not appear to me that the submissions by trial counsel were of sufficient force or clarity so that his Honour could in any way be criticised for not himself remembering the element of challenge to methodology that may have been implicit in trial counsel’s address to the jury. 118 The submission of trial counsel I have set out is not of a character which would render inappropriate his Honour’s reliance on an express acknowledgement by the person representing the Appellant at the relevant time that there had been no challenge to her methodology. 119 There are some aspects of his Honour’s directions to the jury which could be understood as giving a significant level of judicial support to the evidence of Dr Sutisno. In the absence of specific submissions directed to these matters I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
      Admissibility of the Opinions 
      
    120 As indicated above, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence of particular similarities between the two categories of photographs of the accused and the third offender was admissible. The process of identification and magnification of stills from the videotape was a process that had to be conducted by Dr Sutisno out of court. Furthermore, the quality of the photographs derived from the videotape was such that the comparison of those stills with the photographs of the Appellant could not be left for the jury to undertake for itself. The identification of points of similarity by Dr Sutisno was based on her skill and training, particularly with respect to facial anatomy. It was also based on her experience with conducting such comparisons on a number of other occasions. Indeed, it could be supported by the experience gained with respect to the videotape itself through the course of multiple viewing, detailed selection, identification and magnification of images. By this process she had become what is sometimes referred to as an “ad hoc expert”. (See Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict.) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 195; R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 at [37]-[68]; R v Li (2003) 139 A Crim R 281 at [39]-[44].) In any event, as noted above, no complaint is made of this evidence. 121 However, the three opinions I have identified at [87] above, were not, the Appellant contends, admissible.122 The admissibility of Dr Sutisno’s evidence has been considered in previous cases. Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the District Court of New South Wales, rejected her evidence in In the matter of the appeal of BLM, (unreported) District Court of New South Wales, 14 September 2005. The facts of that case were closely analogous to the present. Three men robbed a post office. The robbery was video recorded. Although some DNA of the Appellant was found in the car used in the robbery, there was no other evidence to connect him to the scene. Additional material became available some two years after the robbery, being the evidence of Dr Sutisno. The case came before the Court some three years after the robbery.123 As in the present proceedings Dr Sutisno gave evidence that she had developed a previously established area of forensic anatomy into a “new area” and that this constituted an “innovation”. 124 Dr Sutisno had inspected the surveillance video and blown up still photographs from it, and compared it with photographs taken of the Appellant, although those photographs were taken some two years later. Blanch J set out her evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “She then gave evidence about a morphological analysis in which she compared various features of the appellant as shown in the photographs and features of the offender as shown in the CCTV. She identified an habitual gesture of side bending or lateral flexion of the neck. She also identified similarities in the nose and upper lip and she prepared a table which set out a significant number of features about the face as shown in the CCTV footage which could be compared to similar features in the face of the appellant. She came to the conclusion that they were the same person.” 
        
       
      
    125 His Honour then indicated that Dr Sutisno referred to her “new progression of a prior field of expertise” and: 
     
      
       
        
        “She then went on to indicate that she was not prepared to discuss precisely what she had developed or the protocols for using it. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In a case where it is necessary to establish that it is a proper matter for expert evidence obviously it is necessary to show what the area of expertise is and what the witness is doing in respect of that field of expertise. The failure in this case to identify what novel approach she had adopted makes it very difficult to make any assessment about whether it is a proper field for expert evidence or not. What is known about it of course is that she is the only person who does it and who knows about it. That might tend to suggest that it is not an established field of expertise.” 
        
       
      
    126 His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … it is also very difficult to know on the basis of the evidence that was given in the Magistrate’s Court how she applied that new area of what she calls her expertise to her conclusions in respect of any of the ways she came to a conclusion about the appellant’s identity.” 
        
       
      
    127 Blanch J concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in view of the fact that she was not prepared to disclose the protocols (by which she means all the points that you should look for) it is impossible to conclude that in respect of her identifications that they are free from the criticism that she has not disclosed the methods which can then be reviewed by a tribunal of fact.” 
        
       
      
    128 Dr Sutisno’s evidence was admitted by Martin CJ in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in The Queen v Murdoch (No 4) [2005] NTSC 78. Martin CJ indicated that there was no challenge to the expertise of Dr Sutisno or to the scientific basis upon which she worked in respect of both facial and body mapping (at [91]). The objections in that case were based on three propositions: that the “field of science should not be recognised in Australia”; that the jury is in as good a position as Dr Sutisno to make a comparison between the features and, alternatively, that her evidence should be limited to the comparison of features and she should not be permitted to express an opinion as to whether the accused is the person on the videotape.129 The scale of certainty adopted by Dr Sutisno in her evidence in Murdoch was not based on the Bromby Scale but on the following characterisation: 
     
      
       
        
        “[94] In her statement, Dr Sutisno identified the levels of identification that she adopts in the following terms: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘1. Unable to determine: Features not visible due to poor quality images for comparison or incorrect perspectives for comparison 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. Not the same person: No features match 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. Inconclusive: Incomplete or limited features for comparison with the lack of characterising or recognisable features, distinctive unique identifiers, or habitual characteristics. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        4. The same person: Multiple number of features match such as the most noticeable or recognisable features, distinctive unique identifiers, habitual characteristics and/or racial traits’.” 
        
       
      
    130 Martin CJ analysed at [97]-[106] the English decisions on the subject particularly R v Stockwell (1993) 97 Cr App R 260; R v Clarke [1995] 2 Cr App R 425; R v Hookway [1999] Crim LR 750.131 His Honour rejected the proposition that the jury could make the comparison themselves. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[108] Further, in my view, it is not appropriate to limit the assistance to merely identifying the relevant characteristics. When regard is had to the nature and detail of the characteristics and the methodology employed by Dr Sutisno, it is readily apparent that her knowledge and expertise in the area of anatomy give Dr Sutisno a significant advantage in the assessment of the significance of the features of comparison both individually and in their combination. Dr Sutisno possesses scientific knowledge, expertise and experience outside the ordinary knowledge, expertise and experience of the jury. This is not a case in which the jury, having been informed of the relevant features, would not be assisted by the expert evidence of Dr Sutisno as to her opinion of the significance of the features individually and in their combination. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [109] In my view, applying the language of King CJ in  
        R v  
        Bonython (1984) 38 SASR 45, facial mapping ‘forms part of a body of knowledge or experience which is sufficiently organised or recognised to be acceptable as a reliable body of knowledge or experience’. Further, by study and experience, Dr Sutisno possesses a sufficient knowledge of the subject matter to render her opinion of value in resolving the issues before the Court. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [110] Body mapping has received limited attention within the scientific community. For that reason it may be regarded as a new technique, but as Dr Sutisno explained it is merely an extension of the well recognised and accepted principles of facial mapping to the remainder of the body. I am satisfied that the technique has ‘a sufficient scientific basis to render results arrived at by that means part of a field of knowledge which is a proper subject of expert evidence’.” 
        
       
      
    132 Martin CJ, after having admitted the evidence, in his judgment added the following, which supported the admissibility of the evidence including evidence capable of satisfying the tests outlined in HG V The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 414 and Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 (discussed below): 
     
      
       
        
        “[114] My decision with respect to the admission of the evidence of Dr Sutisno was based upon both her report and evidence given in the absence of the jury. In evidence before the jury, Dr Sutisno provided greater detail of the work she undertook in arriving at her opinion. In particular, the evidence demonstrated the significance of Dr Sutisno’s expertise and experience in assessing the existence and significance of various characteristics both individually and in their combination. Having heard Dr Sutisno give evidence before the jury, I remained of the view that her evidence was admissible and should not be excluded in the exercise of my discretion. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [115] Subsequently the accused called Professor Henneberg who is a particularly experienced scientist in the field of anthropological and comparative anatomy. Professor Henneberg commenced learning how to identify individuals from the analysis of their anatomical features in the 1970s. Since the mid 1980s on many occasions he has undertaken analyses of the images of persons depicted in security CCTV systems or photographs for the purposes of anatomical comparison with suspects. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [116] Professor Henneberg referred to the process as photo comparison. He agreed that although Dr Sutisno spoke of facial and body mapping, she was undertaking the same process which he had been doing for close to 30 years. Asked if Dr Sutisno undertook the process in the same way, Professor Henneberg gave the following answer: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘She, in her description – I haven’t seen her performing analysis – in her description, she uses the same basic principle approach of comparing images, feature by feature, the images from some CCTV footage and images of suspects. To that extent, it’s the same procedure’. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [117] In my opinion, the evidence of Professor Henneberg confirmed that the evidence of Dr Sutisno is admissible.” 
        
       
      
    133 His Honour went on to refer to the judgment of Justice Blanch and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[118] It appears that evidence had been given that Dr Sutisno had developed a new progression of a prior field of expertise and, significantly, that Dr Sutisno was not prepared to disclose the protocols upon which she relied. In those circumstances it is not surprising that his Honour reached the view that the evidence was inadmissible. The difficulty facing Chief Judge Blanch does not exist with respect to the evidence under consideration. Dr Sutisno explained in considerable detail the factual basis upon which she relied and the methodology she adopted.” 
        
       
      
    134 Section 79 has two limbs. Under the first limb, it is necessary to identify “specialised knowledge”, derived from one of the three matters identified, i.e. “training, study or experience”. Under the second limb, it is necessary that the opinion be “wholly or substantially based on that knowledge”. Accordingly, it is a requirement of admissibility that the opinion be demonstrated to be based on the specialised knowledge. The Appellant invokes each limb.135 With respect to the first limb of s79, I have set out above the evidence of the nature of the specialised knowledge which Dr Sutisno said she had brought to bear in the formulation of the three opinions she expressed. There does appear to be a body of expertise based on facial identification. The detailed knowledge of anatomy which Dr Sutisno unquestionably had, together with her training, research and experience in the course of facial reconstruction supports her evidence of facial characteristics. 136 Nothing was presented to the Court which indicates, in any way, that Dr Sutisno’s extension from facial to body mapping, with respect to matters of posture, has anything like that level of background and support. Specialist knowledge of posture can of course exist. (See e.g. R v Li supra at [106].) But the foundation for admissibility must be lain. It was not lain in the present case. The so-called “unique identifier” of posture was an essential element of Dr Sutisno’s evidence of identity in the present case.137 The focus of attention must be on the words “specialised knowledge”, not on the introduction of an extraneous idea such as “reliability”. (Cf Velevski v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 402 at [82], [154]-[160]; Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v George NSWSC 19 November 1997 per Einstein J (unreported); Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Limited [1999] NSWSC 828 at [242]; Odgers Uniform Evidence Law (6th Ed) at par 1.3.4260; Freckleton and Selby Expert Evidence: Law, Practice, Procedure and Advocacy (3rd Ed) at 97-98; Anderson, Hunter and Williams The New Evidence Law (2002) at 246.)138 In the immediate context of “specialised knowledge”, picked up by the words “that knowledge” in the second limb of s79, the word “knowledge” has a different connotation to that which it might have in a different context, e.g. “common knowledge”. The meaning of “knowledge” in s79 is, in my opinion, the same as that identified in the reasons of the majority judgment in Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc 509 US 579 (1993) at 590: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he word ‘knowledge’ connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation. The term applies to any body of known facts or to any body of ideas inferred from such facts or accepted as truths on good grounds’.” 
        
       
      
    The quoted definition is from an American dictionary. 139 I do not mean to suggest that Daubert and its progeny in the United States has anything useful to say about s79 of the Evidence Act. Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (2004), which fell to be interpreted in Daubert, is in quite different terms to s79. The definition of the word “knowledge” in this cognate context is, however, instructive. 140 In the case of the Appellant the relevant evidence about posture was expressed in terms of “upright posture of the upper torso” or similar words. The only links to any form of “training, study or experience” was the witnesses’ study of anatomy and some experience, entirely unspecified in terms of quality or extent, in comparing photographs for the purpose of comparing “posture”. The evidence in this trial did not disclose, and did not permit a finding, that Dr Sutisno’s evidence was based on a study of anatomy. That evidence barely, if at all, rose above a subjective belief and it did not, in my opinion, manifest anything of a “specialised” character. It was not, in my opinion, shown to be “specialised knowledge” within the meaning of s79.141 Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the second limb of s79 was not satisfied with respect to each of the three opinions expressed by Dr Sutisno.142 There was nothing in the present case remotely like the evidence before this Court when it accepted voice identification as a field of expert study or knowledge which could support evidence in the form that the two voices were the same. (R v Gilmore (1977) 2 NSWLR 935 at 937-938, 95-41; See also the considerable detail explaining the new technique in R v McHardie and Danielson [1983] 2 NSWLR 733 at 755-763.)143 In the absence of any kind of objective standard or data base which is capable of leading to a quantification of probabilities, such as is given in the context of DNA evidence, evidence of similarity may have a cumulative effect, by reason of the number of points of similarity. Directions to the jury of the probability of the various matters coinciding can be helpfully put in terms of the ordinary experience of jurors. An exceptionally useful direction to the jury of this character is that employed in relation to fingerprint evidence in its early years in R v Krausch (1913) 32 NZLR 1229 at 1230-1231, about which I have expressed the view that it could serve as a model for directions on DNA evidence. (See R v JCG [2001] NSWCCA 504; 127 A Crim R 493 at [91]-[93].)144 Facial mapping and, perhaps, body mapping, about the validity of the latter of which virtually nothing appears on the evidence in this case, has a certain resemblance to fingerprint evidence. By long usage, expert evidence is given in the form of an opinion that the fingerprint of the accused is the same as that from the crime scene. Such an opinion is based on the cumulative effect of a number of points of similarity, each of which is itself an expression of opinion.145 Following Daubert supra, a debate emerged in the United States as to whether fingerprint evidence had the requisite scientific basis to justify the expression of opinion that the accused and the offender are the same.

L. 265 (2005); Simon A Cole “Does ‘Yes” Really Mean Yes” The Attempt to Close Debate on The Admissibility of Fingerprint Testimony” 45 Jurimetrics J. 449 (2005).) 146 Evidence in the traditional form has been upheld since Daubert. However, the U.S. debate emphasises the significance of the step from evidence of similarity, to a conclusion about the identity of the suspect and the offender. Facial mapping, let alone body mapping, was not shown, on the evidence in the trial, to constitute “specialised knowledge” of a character which can support an opinion of identity. 147 As Gleeson CJ said in HG v The Queen at [39]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provisions of s79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question.” 
        
       
      
    148 His Honour also said at [40]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the witness had to identify the expertise he could bring to bear and … his opinions had to be related to his expertise.” 
        
       
      
    (See also at [44].)149 To similar effect is the analysis of Heydon JA in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles at [85] where, after setting out the observations of Gleeson CJ in HG v The Queen, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of ‘specialised knowledge’; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be ‘wholly or substantially based on the witness's expert knowledge’; so far as the opinion is based on facts ‘observed’ by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on ""assumed"" or ‘accepted’ facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert's evidence must explain how the field of ‘specialised knowledge’ in which the witness is expert by reason of ‘training, study or experience’, and on which the opinion is ‘wholly or substantially based’, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert's specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight.” 
        
       
      
    150 Similarly in Ocean Marine Mutual Insurance Association (Europe) OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd (2000) 120 FCR 146 at [18], [23], the Full Court required “exposure of the reasoning process” so as to demonstrate “that the opinion is based on … specialised knowledge”.151 See also Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Rich (No 2) (2005) 54 ACSR 326 at [96]-[102].152 Similarly, evidence based on a new technique such as voice identification was not admissible if the evidence “went outside the field of specialist knowledge … so that it could be said that that conclusion did not arise from his expertise” (emphasis added). (McHardie and Danielson supra at 754.) Although s79 does not adopt the “field of expertise” approach, this reasoning requiring a demonstrable link to specialised knowledge is applicable to s79 of the Evidence Act, albeit no longer with respect to identification evidence as defined – see R v Adler (2000) 52 NSWLR 451.153 In Makita Heydon JA posed a series of questions about the evidence in that case, including: 
     
      
       
        
        “[87] … Did [the report] furnish the trial judge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of its conclusions? Did it enable him to form his own independent judgment by applying the criteria furnished to the facts proved? Was it intelligible, convincing and tested? Did it go beyond a bare  
        ipse dixit 
        ?” 
        
       
      
    154 The three opinions of Dr Sutisno in the present case do not, in my view, go beyond a “bare ipse dixit”. Dr Sutisno did not identify the terms of the “strict protocol” that she purported to have applied, nor did she set out the basis on which the “protocol” was developed. Indeed, she said that this information was confidential, because of what she described as a “process of patenting my innovations”. Accordingly, she had not published any of these “innovations”. The critical matter is that she did not identify her “protocol” or explain its basis. 155 The evidence in this case, supports the conclusion the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, expressed in England in R v Gray [2003] EWCA Crim 1001, admittedly in the context of an expert who had been significantly discredited. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[16] … Mr Harrow, like some other facial imaging and mapping experts, said that comparison of the facial characteristics provided ‘strong support for the identification of the robber as the appellant’. No evidence was led of the number of occasions on which any of the six facial characteristics identified by him as ‘the more unusual and thus individual’ were present in the general population, nor as to the frequency of the occurrence in the general population, of combinations of these or any other facial characteristics. Mr Harrow did not suggest that there was any national database of facial characteristics or any accepted mathematical formula, as in the case of fingerprint comparison, from which conclusions as to the probability or occurrence of particular facial characteristics or combinations of facial characteristics could safely be drawn. This court is not aware of the existence of any such database or agreed formula. In their absence any estimate of probabilities and any expression of the degree of support provided by particular facial characteristics or combinations of facial characteristics must be only the subjective opinion of the facial imaging or mapping witness. There is no means of determining objectively whether or not such an opinion is justified. Consequently, unless and until a national database or agreed formula or some other such objective measure is established, this court doubts whether such opinions should ever be expressed by facial imaging or mapping witnesses. The evidence of such witnesses, including opinion evidence, is of course both admissible and frequently of value to demonstrate to a jury with, if necessary, enhancement techniques afforded by specialist equipment, particular facial characteristics or combinations of such characteristics so as to permit the jury to reach its own conclusion – see  
        Attorney General’s Reference No 2 of 2002 [2002] EWCA Crim 2373 
        ; but on the state of the evidence in this case, and if this court’s understanding of the current position is correct in other cases too, such evidence should stop there.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The Unsafe and Unsatisfactory Ground 
      
    156 For the reasons I have identified above, the appeal should be allowed. The unsafe and unsatisfactory ground only needs to be considered on the issue of whether or not the Court should order a new trial. In my view, the Court should do so. 157 There is a body of evidence of a circumstantial character capable of supporting a conviction. I refer to the fingerprints on cigarette packets, the circumstance that the Appellant happened to be present with the two undoubted offenders within a short period after the event, well before the 40 minutes had elapsed at the end of which the other two were arrested. It is open to a jury to completely reject his version of the events. The evidence of Dr Sutisno of similarity, at least with respect to the facial features, is capable of adding strength to the Crown’s circumstantial case. Even if she is not able to express the conclusory opinions of the character she did express, she can give evidence which supports of the Crown case.158 In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the Court should order a new trial.159 SIMPSON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.160 ADAMS J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Paul Robert Smith appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty to an offence of demanding money with menaces. That plea was entered on the first day that Mr Smith was due to stand trial. However he was due to stand trial for a different offence. It appears that the Crown concedes that his plea of guilty to demand money with menaces was made at the first opportunity. Thus even though the matter had occupied the time of the courts, both in the Local court and this Court to the stage where Mr Smith’s trial was ready to proceed, it is in these circumstances appropriate that I treat the plea as being entered at the earliest opportunity.2 Mr Smith suffered a motorbike accident in 2001 and is now in a wheelchair. Despite that fact, he has continued to commit offences involving violence and threats of violence. Whilst Mr Smith is deserving of sympathy, and indeed a great deal of sympathy, for the situation in which he finds himself, the fact that he is confined to a wheelchair does not give him a licence to commit serious offences without being punished. That is an important factor to bear in mind as I outline the facts of the present matter.3 Contact was made between the offender and a DG over a sex chat line and they agreed to meet. Some time before the offender went to DG’s premises he told him he was in a wheelchair. After he arrived, sexual activity took place. At about 4.30am on 18 April 2005, the offender asked DG for $500 saying he wanted to buy a car. DG refused. The offender then made a further request for money by asking for the victim’s keycard. DG again refused. DG then said that he would call Mr Smith a taxi so that he could leave. Mr Smith was apparently upset at being asked to leave. 4 It was at about 6.15am that both Mr Smith and DG were lying on the bed when the victim felt something sharp against his left hip area. He noticed that it was a brown handled knife about twenty centimetres long. He was too frightened to leave the bed. He was afraid that he was going to be stabbed. On at least two occasions the victim felt the knife pressed harder against his hip but again he said he was too frightened to get off the bed. There were threats made, where the offender said he would stab the victim, he said that he would kill him. Finally the offender said,  
     
      
     
     
      
      “This is how this thing started about the car and it will finish about the car, just give me $500 and treat it like a lesson.”  
      
    5 Eventually DG was able to get away and call the police. The offender was still in Mr G’s premises when the police arrived.6 This is a serious offence. The courts have said on many occasions that those who commit offences carrying knives deserve to be treated with little leniency. It is a particularly aggravating factor that this offence was committed whilst Mr Smith was on a bond and that bond was for an offence also involving Mr Smith’s use of a knife.7 Mr Smith has a lengthy criminal history, although it has to be said that whilst there are a large number of offences, most of them seem to have been dealt with in the Local Court, with one matter of stealing or attempting to steal from the person, and a couple of other common assault matters. This appears to be one of the most serious of the offender’s offences.8 Prior to his motorbike accident he was in a de facto relationship. This relationship was of course difficult with Mr Smith going to gaol on regular occasions. It was also difficult because Mr Smith was a user of illicit drugs. It seems that the relationship has not survived Mr Smith’s accident of 2001 and they have now separated.9 For a while Mr Smith lived with his parents but he has now formed a new relationship and spends some significant time with his new partner. 10 The offender is of course undergoing a great deal of treatment and rehabilitation because of his incomplete paraplegia. Matters are unsettled at the moment. In May last year the offender had an operation but rather than improving his health, it seems that that has adversely affected it. He is now experiencing less upper body strength than he had before. Inquiries are continuing as to why that should be the case. He got an MRI last Thursday which is designed to see whether a further operation is required. He is to see a doctor about that possibility next Thursday 8 June. 11 More rehabilitation has been arranged, it is to begin next Tuesday. The offender is also due to have a catheter inserted. He is on a waiting list for that operation and was told some months ago that he was on that list and that it could be up to six months before he gets to the head of the queue so that the operation can be carried out. 12 There is no doubt that this is a serious offence and deserving of significant punishment. I have to, of course, take into account the harm that an offence causes when I determine the appropriate sentence for it. In this case, there is a victim impact statement. What is foreseeable is generally the limit of the harm that can be taken into account. In other words, the law does not punish people for harm which is unforeseeable. I do not wish to understate the seriousness of the offender’s conduct but the extent of the consequences for DG are, I am satisfied, of a level which was not foreseeable. 13 Another aspect of the victim impact statement is that it refers in more detail to matters which are in the statement of facts. Although the statement of facts record threats to Mr Smith, the victim impact statement contains more graphic details of those. It is a difficult matter and easy to produce error where a victim impact statement was prepared on the basis of material which reveals a more serious offence than that in an agreed statement of facts. A similar matter arose in the decision of R v Bakewell, unreported, CCA 27 June 1996. In that case there was a Di Simoni v The Queen problem, which does not appear to have arisen here but the principles are the same.14 The crown points to material from the corrective services authorities indicating how they deal with someone who, like Mr Smith, is confined to a wheelchair. No doubt arrangements can be made for Mr Smith’s accommodation in gaol. Indeed he spent ten months in gaol only recently, although that was at a time when he says he was better than he currently is. This is not a case where no arrangements can be made to suitably accommodate Mr Smith. Such arrangements can clearly be made. That is not to suggest of course that I should ignore Mr Smith’s disability. Clearly he will do his time in custody harder than would someone without a disability such as that from which Mr Smith suffers.15 As I began these remarks on sentence, Mr Smith needs to understand that the fact that he has incomplete paraplegia does not mean that he can commit serious offences without being punished, however I do not propose to proceed to finally determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Smith today. Section 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act allow me to make an order adjourning proceedings and granting bail to the offender for a number of purposes. They include assessing his capacity and prospects for rehabilitation as well as allowing Mr Smith to demonstrate that he has rehabilitated. I am also able to take into account Mr Smith’s medical needs. As I have mentioned there are three particular aspects of his medical treatment which are to come to fruition in the near future. A decision will be made whether he needs surgery next Thursday. He is to commence more rehabilitation next Tuesday and he is on the waiting list for his catheter. They are also matters I considered appropriate in determining to impose a s11 remand in the present circumstances. Mr Smith needs however to understand, that should he fail to demonstrate rehabilitation during the period of remand, then there is no good reason why a sentence of full time custody is not to be imposed.16 For the purpose of assessing Mr Smith’s rehabilitation, allowing him to demonstrate rehabilitation and for the purpose of allowing Mr Smith to receive ongoing medical treatment, I adjourn this matter until 16 February 2007 and Mr Smith is required to appear back before this court. I order an updated pre-sentence report for that day. I grant bail to Mr Smith subject to the following conditions. 17 Mr Smith is to report to the office of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service at Liverpool within seven days and to comply with their reasonable directions. He is to live with his mother and father during the period of the adjournment or at some other address provided he notify both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the registrar of this court of his intention to move. That he be of good behaviour during the period of the remand and that he not be in possession of any knife apart from an item of cutlery which is he using for the purpose for which it is designed. He is to report to police at Cabramatta Police Station every Monday.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: 
     
      
      Nature of claim 
       
      This is a claim by the plaintiff in negligence against the first defendant, North Sydney Council (hereafter called the Council) in respect of a motor vehicle accident, which occurred shortly before 1am on 20 July 1995. The plaintiff was travelling South in Alfred Street, Milsons Point and the accident occurred at the intersection of that street and Fitzroy Street. The Council had the management of road works, which were being carried out at that intersection. The plaintiff alleges that it was the Council’s negligent management of those road works which was a cause of his accident. When tested after the accident, the plaintiff had a blood alcohol concentration of .133. 
       
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    2 Although there were a number of disputed issues of fact, the general background was relatively uncontroversial. I have indicated those matters which were in dispute. Except as otherwise indicated, I find the factual background to be as set out in the following paragraphs. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff was born on 27 November 1956 in Melbourne. He attended the Peninsula Church of England Grammar School and completed his final year at the age of 17-18. While at school he had no particular interest in academic pursuits. Upon leaving school his ambition was to be the best guitarist he could be. 
     
      
    4 He thereafter had a series of odd jobs for the next two or three years, which included work as a kitchen hand and work at a used car lot. Any money he saved he used to purchase musical equipment. Towards the end of this period he and some friends including James Reyne formed a band called “Spiff Rouch”. The plaintiff was receiving guitar lessons and developing his skills as a guitarist during these years. 
     
      
    5 The band “Spiff Rouch” achieved some success and remained together for a year. The plaintiff and James Reyne thereafter started their own band, “Australian Crawl”. That band started to achieve success in the Melbourne music scene in the summer of 1979. Between 1979 and 1986 it would be fair to say that the band “Australian Crawl” was one of the leading rock bands in Australia. During that period it produced a number of very successful songs. The plaintiff was the lead guitarist in the band and participated in the writing of most of the successful songs. James Reyne was the lead singer. 
     
      
    6 Although the plaintiff earned considerable sums of money during this period, he appears to have spent it as quickly as he received it. The band “Australian Crawl” broke up in February 1986 as a result of differences of opinion between band members, in particular the plaintiff and the lead singer, James Reyne. At that time the plaintiff’s assets comprised $10,000 and a collection of guitars and Japanese swords. 
     
      
    7 Despite that modest financial position, I accept the submission on behalf of the plaintiff, that at that time the plaintiff was recognised as a highly skilled and accomplished guitarist and had a high profile in the rock music industry, not only in Australia but also overseas. He had also gained valuable experience as to how the rock music industry operated. 
     
      
    8 Following the break up of the band, the plaintiff travelled to Japan and stayed for a year and a half. The plaintiff says he fell in love with Japan and that is why he stayed. He does not appear to have worked in any consistent way. He supported himself by selling his guitar collection and his Japanese swords.  
     
      
    9 After his sojourn in Japan, the plaintiff travelled to Los Angeles. He had about $20,000 with him. He spent his time there setting up a new band and collaborating with the band members in the writing of songs. He returned to Melbourne in February 1988 following the sudden death of his father. 
     
      
    10 Following his return to Melbourne, he worked for about six months as an employed guitarist with Broderick Smith. Broderick Smith was well known in the rhythm and blues music field and was the lead singer of a band “Carson”. The plaintiff received a regular but modest salary during this period. 
     
      
    11 In late 1988 the plaintiff was contacted by a friend, Chris Batson, who was based in Singapore. Mr Batson invited the plaintiff to go to Singapore to work in his uncle’s company, composing music to be used in advertising. The plaintiff accepted. 
     
      
    12 The first thing the plaintiff had to do when he arrived in Singapore was to rearrange the recording studio owned by Mr Batson’s uncle so that it could function effectively. The plaintiff was not paid for this and there appears to have been a falling out between him and Mr Batson’s uncle. As a result, the plaintiff went into business on his own account in Singapore, composing and recording music for use in advertising. Initially he used the studio owned by Mr Batson’s uncle, but later set up his own studio. He was writing, recording and producing the music which was used in the business. 
     
      
    13 The plaintiff appears to have been quite successful. He had clients not only in Singapore, but also in Indonesia, Kuwait and the Philippines. His evidence was that although the income was not regular, it was significant. The plaintiff estimated that he earned $250,000 for each of the years 1989 and 1990 before expenses and before taxation were deducted. The sort of expenses which needed to be deducted were the cost of a car, operating the studio and the cost of purchasing equipment, both for the studio and for use by the plaintiff at home. There were also travel expenses and the cost of office staff. 
     
      
    14 The plaintiff met his wife, Sharon, in 1989 and they were married in April 1990. She was unable to provide any detailed evidence as to the plaintiff’s earnings during this period. The effect of her evidence was that the plaintiff was leading a fairly lavish lifestyle, which included parties at his home. He was able to generously provide for her financially which included providing her with a credit card. Her evidence was that she spent a lot of money on clothes, shoes, holidays and entertainment and that the plaintiff did not restrain her in any way. Neither the plaintiff nor his wife was able to give evidence as to how much money was available after the deduction of expenses and taxes. 
     
      
    15 No document was produced in the plaintiff’s case in relation to this evidence. There were no bank records, no taxation records and no records of receipts and expenditure. Despite this lack of appropriate evidence, I am prepared to accept that the plaintiff did achieve a measure of financial success in Singapore at this time for a period of approximately two years. The absence of any detail in the evidence does not allow me to make a more precise finding. 
     
      
    16 The plaintiff and his wife returned to Melbourne in late 1991. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he did so because his wife was pregnant and he did not trust the Singapore health system. He thought it would be safer for her to have their child in Australia. Lizzie was born in February 1992. 
     
      
    17 In the third year of its operation, the plaintiff’s business in Singapore was not successful. The plaintiff explained this by saying that he was having problems with his wife’s former boyfriend, who was influential in Singapore society, and that this affected his ability to successfully conduct the business. While I am not prepared to accept the reason put forward by the plaintiff for why his business did not maintain its success, it is sufficient for these proceedings that I find that the business did not operate profitably in its third year of operation. This is confirmed by some incomplete letters from the Inland Revenue Department of Singapore in 1992 and 1994 which suggest that for the financial year ending 30 June 1992, the business was operating at a loss. 
     
      
    18 When the plaintiff and his wife returned to Melbourne, they had little by way of assets. The plaintiff expected that he would easily find work because of his previous reputation in the music industry, but he was disappointed in that expectation. The family moved into a flat in Toorak where rent was expensive. The plaintiff had little work and there were money problems. The plaintiff’s wife was unable to work due to post-natal depression and the only income was social services and royalties from songs which were written when the plaintiff was a member of “Australian Crawl”. Following the death of his mother, the family moved into the plaintiff’s mother’s house. These were rented premises. The death of his mother upset the plaintiff greatly.  
     
      
    19 Because there was no work for him in Australia, the plaintiff in early 1994 went to Jakarta. He was encouraged to do so by his friend Chris Batson. The plaintiff’s wife and child went to Singapore and lived with her mother while he commuted between Jakarta and Singapore. The plaintiff’s evidence was that there were problems in Jakarta with his business associates. They refused to pay him for recording equipment which he had brought with him to set up a recording studio. He said that although he earned $US110,000 he was only paid half of that amount. He and his family flew to Sydney in February 1995. 
     
      
    20 As with the period of employment in Singapore, there are no documents to support the plaintiff’s evidence as to his earnings in Jakarta. It seems to me that the 1994 Jakarta venture was not particularly successful for the plaintiff from a financial point of view. When he arrived in Sydney, he had $10,000 - $20,000 and a certain amount of recording equipment which he had successfully removed from Indonesia. 
     
      
    21 The plaintiff’s intention in moving to Sydney was to obtain musical work in the film industry. He was sick, he said, of writing jingles for use in advertising. The plaintiff and his wife rented a serviced apartment in Milsons Point before moving to Darley Street, Neutral Bay where he was residing at the time of his accident.  
     
      
    22 Between February and July 1995 the plaintiff did not actually perform any remunerative work. He spent his time with introductions and visiting agencies to make them aware of his availability and to provide them with his “show reel”. This was a visual demonstration of his work. He was also setting up a band with David Peach and Wayne Doyle. Before a new band could start, it had to have new songs and much of the time between February and July 1995 was spent writing and rehearsing new songs for this band. At the time the plaintiff’s wife was still not able to work. 
     
      
    23 I will deal with the circumstances of the accident in detail under the heading “Liability”. 
     
      
    24 A matter in dispute was the extent to which the plaintiff’s headaches disabled him from employment before the accident. It was common ground that the plaintiff had experienced migrainous type headaches since the age of nine or ten. These headaches had afflicted the plaintiff while he was a member of “Australian Crawl”. A 1985 promotional video (exhibit F) included an interview with the plaintiff during the course of which he complained about the debilitating nature of his migraine headaches. These did not prevent him performing with “Australian Crawl”. 
     
      
    25 There was little evidence of the number and extent of the plaintiff’s headaches between the date of exhibit F and the plaintiff’s return to Melbourne in late 1991. The plaintiff’s wife said that during the period his migraines were intermittent, occurring once every couple of months. She noticed that they were becoming more frequent, and occurred mainly when the plaintiff was stressed. She was aware that he was receiving medical attention for his migraines while in Singapore. She had a specific recollection of one occasion when the plaintiff was so disabled by his headaches that she had to take him to a hospital in Singapore where he received an injection of Pethidine. 
     
      
    26 It is only after the plaintiff’s return to Melbourne that medical records exist which refer to his headaches. The earliest of these is a report from Dr Waterson, neurologist, in December 1991 to the effect that the plaintiff was experiencing bad migraine attacks once a week and that he had tried Propranol, Deseril and Sandomigrain without beneficial effect. 
     
      
    27 Throughout 1992 the plaintiff continued to suffer from migraine headaches. This was complicated by depression which developed in May 1992. On one weekend a general practitioner was called to see the plaintiff on three occasions because of his headaches. Pethidine was being prescribed for his headaches on a regular basis. The plaintiff’s evidence was that his headaches would only respond to Pethidine. More than one doctor expressed concern that the plaintiff was developing problems with drug dependence, with specific reference to Benzodiazepines and Pethidine. 
     
      
    28 The situation does not seem to have improved during 1993. The plaintiff’s headaches continued to respond only to injections of Pethidine. His headaches were often associated with neck ache. The plaintiff’s pain was described as chronic and severe in nature and medical opinion was that it was important for the plaintiff to find an alternative treatment to Pethidine. 
     
      
    29 There are no medical records which relate to the plaintiff’s headaches and treatment for them during 1994. This is not surprising since he spent most of that year in Jakarta and Singapore. There is nothing to suggest, however, that the headaches ceased or moderated in either their frequency or intensity. This can be inferred from the fact that almost immediately upon his return to Australia in February 1995, medical records indicate that the plaintiff was again being prescribed Pethidine for his migraine headaches. Handwritten clinical notes from the Big Bear Medical Centre dated 4 March 1995 refer to “claims Pethidine only for pain” and “possible substance abuse”. 
     
      
    30 In the plaintiff’s written submissions a convenient summary was set out of the plaintiff’s attendances at medical centres for his migraine headaches and neck pain problems. 
     
      
       
      March 1995 – 15 attendances 
       
      April 1995 – 14 attendances 
       
      May 1995 – 17 attendances 
       
      June 1995 – 9 attendances 
       
      July 1995 – 3 attendances. 
       
      
    31 In many of those attendances the plaintiff sought and was given Pethidine injections, although other medications were also prescribed. A report of Dr Peter King, psychiatrist, dated 3 July 1995, referred to the plaintiff’s history of medication as “including Pethidine starting from 1989, Panadeine Forte up to 20 a week and numerous other psycho-tropic drugs including Tricyclic antidepressants, Toroidal, Morphine, Sodium Valproate and many more”. 
     
      
    32 Against this background it was submitted on behalf of the Council that the plaintiff at this time was addicted to Pethidine and that this addiction, combined with his headaches and neck problems, meant that he would have found it very difficult to maintain any regular employment at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    33 On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that although he did have ongoing problems with migraine headaches, he was showing signs of successfully managing that problem and that in the past he had succeeded in managing it and in carrying on a successful career. The basis for the submission that the plaintiff was showing signs of managing his headaches at the time of the accident was that medical records revealed only one injection of Pethidine in June 1995 and none in July. 
     
      
    34 I am not prepared to conclude that as of the date of the accident the plaintiff was addicted to Pethidine, although that was certainly a concern expressed by a number of doctors whom he consulted between February and July 1995. I do find, however, that between February and July 1995 the plaintiff had a serious problem with migraine headaches and neck pain which at the time of the accident was not showing any real signs of improvement. The reference to one injection of Pethidine in June 1995 and none in July, says more about the unavailability of records than an improvement in the plaintiff’s condition. Neither he nor his wife gave evidence of any improvement before the accident. The effect of this finding on the plaintiff’s claim for damages I will deal with in due course. 
     
      
    35 As a result of the accident the plaintiff suffered a closed head injury, a fractured left scapula, a fractured left mastoid and a possible fracture at the base of the skull. He also suffered right and left occipital scalp lacerations which required a blood transfusion. A golden staph infection subsequently developed in those wounds. On admission to hospital a CT scan of the brain demonstrated contusions in the right temporal parietal region with generalised mass effect. No focal injuries were indicated. A subsequent CT of the brain on 31 July 1995 indicated a resolution of the contusions and no further neural damage.  
     
      
    36 The plaintiff was admitted to the Royal North Shore Hospital where he remained until 3 August 1995. On that date he was transferred to the Royal Rehabilitation Centre at Ryde. He remained an inpatient of the centre until he was discharged home on 22 August 1995. The reason for his discharge was that he had become impatient with treatment and wished to be at home with his family. He had post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) from which he did not emerge until 14 August 1995. This placed his injury in the category of “a severe head injury”. 
     
      
    37 Upon his admission to the Royal Rehabilitation Centre, he had a lower level nerve palsy affecting his left leg. There was some decreased sensitivity and power on the right side and a decrease in right hand fine motor control. He walked with an unsteady gait. Following intensive treatment, his mobility improved so that he was able to walk independently over all surfaces. He was left with a high-level balance problem. This produced a tendency to lose his balance when bending. He was left with a generalised weakness on the right side, particularly affecting right hand function. Given his previous expertise as a guitarist, this was of considerable concern to the plaintiff and caused him great anxiety. 
     
      
    38 Shortly before his discharge from the rehabilitation centre, the plaintiff underwent a neuropsychological examination. The results of that assessment were: 
     
      
       
        
        “The current assessment demonstrates severe memory and new learning difficulties, indicating a deterioration in functioning. Mr Binks’ memory performance indicates reduced encoding capacity, despite having adequate attention, concentration and sensory spans. 
        
       
       
        
        It is suggested that Mr Binks may have suffered some hypoxic damage as a result of the obstructed airways and profuse bleeding which occurred at the time of injury. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition to his impaired memory functioning, Mr Binks demonstrates some executive deficits, such as reduced fluency, perseveration and poor planning. Mr Binks’ disorganised and impulsive attitude towards tasks has reduced his overall performance.” 
        
       
      
    39 As of the date of trial, the plaintiff continued to have problems with fine movements in his right hand. He also appeared to have some difficulty in negotiating the steps in and out of the witness box. It is not clear whether that was due to large amounts of medication which he was taking, or to problems with ambulation. In his evidence (T.202) he indicated that once out of hospital he started running and in particular could run to Cremorne Point and back again and became quite active physically. That evidence is somewhat inconsistent with what I observed him to be able to do in court. On the other hand, he was assessed by physiotherapists from the Royal North Shore Hospital in October 1995 as having “good mobility”. 
     
      
    40 During the trial, it was obvious that there was some facial asymmetry affecting the left side of the plaintiff’s face. It drooped slightly by comparison with the right. This appears to be a direct consequence of the accident. On occasions the plaintiff’s speech was slurred while giving evidence. It is not clear whether this was due to the high levels of medication which he was taking or whether it was a direct consequence of the accident. 
     
      
    41 Following the accident the plaintiff continued to recuperate at home, perform prescribed exercises at home and attend the rehabilitation centre from time to time as an outpatient. He underwent a neuropsychological review on 2 August 1996. The results of that review by Ms Mariott-Lloyd, the same neuropsychologist who had previously examined him, were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Binks presents thirteen months post severe head trauma. The current assessment indicates that the significant memory deficits, in both modalities, noted previously have not resolved. Mr Binks has a significant encoding deficit, despite immediate registration capacity. He also continues to demonstrate some organisational and manipulation difficulties.  
        
       
       
        
        In contrast, Mr Binks’ other executive deficits appear to have ameliorated. This improvement is evident in his increased insight, utilisation of feedback, decreased frustration, impulsivity and perseveration. 
        
       
       
        
        The change in Mr Binks’ insight is fundamental as he is now open to the use of compensatory strategies, can accept feedback and make realistic future plans.” 
        
       
      
    42 In April 1997 Ms Narci Sutton, a clinical psychologist from the Royal Rehabilitation Centre, who had been treating the plaintiff since his first admission there, reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a recent neuropsychological assessment he was found to have memory deficits in both modalities (verbal and visual). He also demonstrated significant encoding deficits and difficulties in organising and manipulating information. This is a particularly severe problem in situations where complex and diverse information needs to be analysed (ie a meeting, a social gathering). He performs best in one to one settings where environmental distractions are reduced. 
        
       
       
        
        I would like to emphasise that in spite of the above difficulties Mr Binks’ overall intelligence level remains above average. This is in fact one of the main contributors to his emotional and adjustment difficulties. He is able to compare and judge between what he could do prior to the accident and what he can do now, thus he can measure his loss and the impact this has in his relationships and his family’s future. Added to this, the brain injury directly impacts on his ability to deal with stressful situations.” 
        
       
      
    43 The plaintiff’s evidence was that he was seeking work after his discharge from the Royal Rehabilitation Centre but was unsuccessful. The plaintiff was rather vague as to the timeframe during which such applications for employment were made.  
     
      
    44 On 22 April 1997 the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service prepared a report for use by the Royal Rehabilitation Centre. I propose to set that report out in full since it provides a useful assessment of the plaintiff’s capacities, both physical and mental, at that time. It also appears to be quite objective and does not show any signs of being contaminated by litigation considerations. 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Binks referred himself to CRS on 05/09/95 after sustaining an Acquired Brain Injury in a Motor Vehicle Accident on 20/07/95. 
        
       
       
        
        Since the time of referral the following areas have been address: 
        
       
       
        
         * Driving – Mr Binks completed a Driving Assessment and then completed 2 driving lessons. After a second assessment, it was recommended he have his licence reinstated. 
        
       
       
        
        * Adjustment to Disability/Education Regarding ABI – Throughout the CRS Program, issues surrounding the difficulties he was experiencing as a result of the injury were addressed eg: 
         
        - Memory – difficulty remembering appointments. Use of a diary was demonstrated and recommended and strategies put in place in the home environment to assist Mr Binks to remember to check his diary. 
         
        - Organisation – Mr Binks found it difficult to organise and prioritise activities, especially related to vocational issues. Initially, time was spent trying to assist him focus on particular vocational activities, with an aim to earn money to alleviate financial difficulties. Mr Binks reports still having difficulties in organising himself when the situation raise his levels of anxiety. 
         
        - Initiation – Mr Binks reports difficulty initiating tasks, especially where it was related to finances and emotional issues. After discussion regarding and setting a structure to the task, he was often able to complete it. 
        
       
       
        
        * Vocational Issues – Early in the Rehab Program, it was established that writing ‘jingles’ for Advertising Companies would be the quickest way to earn money. Setting up a studio from where he could work, was complicated by the fact that his equipment was missing and related insurance problems. A further difficulty was Mr Binks’ uncertainty that he could still “create”. Two simulated Work Training were set up with 2UE and George Patterson Advertising Company. During the latter, it was established that Mr Binks was able to “create” and received positive feedback from the Creative Director for his work. 
        
       
       
        
        Since his Work Training, Mr Binks, with the assistance of his wife, has been to visit and promoted himself to many advertising companies. As of yet, he has received no work. Mr Binks is currently involved in other projects, which he hopes will generate financial income. 
        
       
       
        
        * Worksite Assessment – Mr Binks was experiencing right shoulder pain after working in his studio so a workplace assessment was completed. As a result, equipment was provided to ensure easier, more ergonomic access to his equipment was possible and an ergonomic chair was provided. Education was provided on posture and workstation setup. 
        
       
       
        
        * Counselling – Mr Binks was concerned about how his wife was coping with the change since the accident. Mrs Binks was referred to a Psychologist for assessment and counselling and names of recommended counsellors were provided for continued counselling. 
         
        Mr Binks was referred to a Psychologist for adjustment to disability counselling to address low self-esteem/confidence issues. 
        
       
       
        
        *Physical Upgrading – Mr Binks underwent a Physical Assessment and joined the Physical Upgrading Group on 2 occasions. Both times, Mr Binks found it difficult to commit himself to attending the group. He feels that he still required physical upgrading and that a Home Program would be more appropriate. This has been set up for him by a physiotherapist. Mr Binks fatigues easily and experiences difficulty with high level coordination of his right hand. 
        
       
       
        
        * Other – Information was provided about Small business and Financial Assistance available. 
        
       
       
        
        * Liaison – Has been maintained with other treating professionals and the DSS regarding benefits. 
        
       
       
        
        Although Mr Binks, as yet, has not completed any paid work, it is felt that there is no further assistance that we can provide him at this time in regards to return to work in his chosen area of music. Discussion has taken place regarding exploring other options of 9-5 jobs. Mr Binks feels that this would not allow him to be free for other projects. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Binks’ CRS file will therefore be closed and he has been informed, that should he require CRS assistance in the future in gaining employment, that he can refer himself to our service again. …” 
        
       
      
    45 The comment in the report as to the plaintiff’s unwillingness to explore “other options of 9-5 jobs” because “this would not allow him to be free for other projects” accords with my assessment. During this period and even up to the present time, the plaintiff has only been interested in jobs which related to the music industry. His evidence was replete with descriptions of “projects” which he tried to get off the ground, but which failed to eventuate either for lack of finance or because he was let down by other persons. These projects were all related to aspects of the music industry. 
     
      
    46 In 2000 the plaintiff was accepted for and attended what he described as the “Award School” which was a course conducted by the advertising industry. The course involved bi-weekly sessions of two to three hours where various forms of creative ideas and strategies for use in the advertising industry were discussed. Towards the end of this course on 5 June 2000 the plaintiff was successful in obtaining employment with an organisation called “Next Generation Entertainment”. 
     
      
    47 The plaintiff obtained the job by responding to an advertisement in a paper. The job involved writing music which would be used in computer games. It turned out that these were gambling games. Although the plaintiff said he was morally opposed to such games, he remained in that employment. “Next Generation Entertainment” was a new company which had offices in George Street, Sydney. The plaintiff was taken on with a number of other new employees. The hours of work were 9 to 5. The plaintiff was set up in a recording studio so that he could perform his work. The plaintiff performed some of the work in his own studio at home, outside the hours of 9 to 5. The music which he composed and produced was purely for background purposes and did not contain lyrics. 
     
      
    48 The plaintiff remained in that employment until October 2001 when he was retrenched. The termination of his employment had nothing to do with the way in which he was performing his work. The plaintiff was not the only person to be retrenched by “New Generation Entertainment” at that time. The plaintiff’s earnings for the year ending 30 June 2001 were $74,766 before tax (ie $978 net per week after tax). 
     
      
    49 The defendant called evidence from Mr Halprin, another employee of “Next Generation Entertainment” who was working with the plaintiff in 2000/2001 and who was retrenched shortly after the plaintiff. Mr Halprin was the person to whom the plaintiff reported when he was working with “Next Generation Entertainment”. He characterised the position of the plaintiff as between that of a sound engineer and a member of the production staff. He described the plaintiff’s work in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Sure, basically we would develop games for various clients and those games would have a sound component. So what we would do is essentially get together with Simon and work out whatever the brief was, it might be some musical themes, some sound effects that needed to be developed and he would write those.” (T.699.52) 
        
       
       
        
        “A. Yes he would write the music, he would play it, edit it and pull it all together in the software and provided us with, you know, final sound files that we could plug into the games.” (T.700.7) 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. At times were outside musicians called in to assist in terms of the sounds you needed? 
         
        A. At times, yes. Sometimes he would do, provide like an end to end solution, other times he would work with some other sound people who would contribute to the process as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In terms of the outside musicians, who used to co-ordinate playing of the instruments by them and the recording? 
         
        A. He would co-ordinate that. We had a small sound studio and he would organise that from there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In terms of where he worked and what he worked with, is it correct to say that essentially his office was the sound studio? 
         
        A. Yes, it was, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And in terms of equipment do you remember what sort of equipment he had within the studio that he used to operate? 
         
        A. The main equipment was a Macintosh, with various sound editing and relevant programmes on it. There was also some external equipment, obviously the guitar because he would play the guitar, some other instruments, maybe some mixing equipment. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In terms of the job as you saw it, as I suppose his manager, was it a complicated job? 
         
        A. Oh, relatively, sure.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say it was complicated are you able to explain what you mean by that? What aspects you regarded as being complicated? 
         
        A. Essentially you need to be able to take a brief, need to be able to create the appropriate music and sound to match that brief. You would need to be able to drive the software on the Macintosh, to be able to edit it all together. Able to compose various pieces of music. So yeah, there were a few components to it.” (T.700) 
        
       
      
    50 Under cross-examination it was sought to establish through Mr Halprin that the plaintiff had difficulties in performing this work. I am not so persuaded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you agreed with that but you were about to say something else about other aspects of his work, weren’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. I mean, you have internal review processes when you work within a creative field and it is important you go through those before you ship the end product. So at times the brief given to him was not necessarily met and you would need to manage it and go back and forward, as you would with artists and programmers until you got what you were looking for.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. Were there any other difficulties you found with him? 
         
        A. Yeah, I guess. I mean, it’s, he wasn’t from the gaming industry and like any industry when you are specialised you can kind of understand what the requirements are, so sometimes there were issues where you would need to explain things a few times because he wasn’t coming from that background.” (T.702) 
        
       
      
    51 From both the plaintiff’s evidence and that of Mr Halprin I am of the opinion that the job with “Next Generation Entertainment” did require intellectual analysis and some creative activity by him. He was particularly well suited to the job because not only did it involve music, but it involved the production and composition of music by use of sounds which were stored in a computer. This was an area in which the plaintiff had particular expertise (T.210). It was also a job where he could work on a one on one basis, rather than being required to work with a group or team. Clearly the plaintiff had no difficulties in commuting to and from work during the sixteen months of his employment, nor does he appear to have had any difficulty in dealing with the substantial sums of money which he earned. Some of that money was used to purchase equipment for the recording studio which the plaintiff set up in his home. 
     
      
    52 The plaintiff’s evidence was that he had no difficulty physically or mentally in performing that job (T.222). He had some difficulties with a person in a management position above him, but he attributed those difficulties to the personality of the other person. His major concern in relation to the job was that it involved performing work in the gaming industry, which he regarded as morally reprehensible. 
     
      
    53 Since his retrenchment in October 2001, the plaintiff has not engaged in any remunerative employment. He said that he had become disillusioned because he had applied for so many jobs and received so many knock backs. When specifically asked “Did you go back to seek advertising jobs” his response was: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. That was held up. Yes, but that was held up because I was trying to put a show reel together of newer stuff because you must remember the stuff I had in my show reel dated back to ’89-’90 so that it is 10 years old and in this industry if it’s 10 days old it is too old …” 
        
       
       
      The plaintiff said that he decided to concentrate on his book and on recording and to go back to working for himself. 
       
      
    54 The conclusion I have reached is that the plaintiff did apply for jobs of a similar kind to that which he had performed for “Next Generation Entertainment”, but that such applications were made over a relatively brief period following his retrenchment, and that his real interest was in his book and re-establishing himself in the music industry. In my opinion, the plaintiff has not looked for paid employment since shortly after being retrenched from “Next Generation Entertainment”. 
     
      
    55 There are a number of references in the plaintiff’s evidence to the book which he has been writing. He seems to have been engaged on that undertaking between 1996 and the present. Two documents were tendered in the course of the proceedings. The first was an early version of the book and the second was the most up to date version. It comprised approximately 35,000 words. The book is not complete but is, as the plaintiff explained, a work in progress. Attempts to have it published have not yet been successful. 
     
      
    56 The book uses as its theme the plaintiff’s life and with that as its narrative background, it comprises a series of reflections by the plaintiff on experiences which he has had and how they have affected him. It is very discursive and does focus significantly on his motor vehicle accident and its sequelae. It contains a number of quotations from philosophical and scientific works as part of the plaintiff’s commentary on his life experiences. 
     
      
    57 A striking feature of the document is the plaintiff’s ability to analyse accurately quite complex philosophical concepts and apply them appropriately. While one may not agree with the conclusions or the particular thesis being put forward by the plaintiff, there is no doubt that intellectually he is of above average intelligence despite the accident. 
     
      
    58 The other impression I gained from the book was that many of the plaintiff’s thought processes are unusual and he sees much of the world around him in black and white terms, without much room for compromise. This rigidity of thought and some obsessional features I believe to be a product of the accident. 
     
      
    59 Since October 2001, apart from working on his book, the plaintiff has been attempting to write and produce music in his recording studio at home. He has sought to teach the guitar on occasions, although the details of this are vague. He has continued in his attempts to promote and develop projects associated with the rock music industry. Many of these projects seem to involve getting together persons who were previously members of bands which were prominent in the 1980’s, or using their music in a more contemporary way. These projects have involved the plaintiff in attending a number of business meetings, but as indicated, none have as yet been successfully launched. 
     
      
    60 In 2002 the plaintiff became involved in litigation between himself and IBM. This arose because of a problem with the hard drive in one of the computers used by the plaintiff and was not remedied by a replacement computer. As a result, the plaintiff lost some material which he had composed. The details of the litigation and its outcome or current status were never clarified in evidence. It was, however, not suggested that the plaintiff’s claim was unfounded or vexatious. The plaintiff appears to have been able to instruct his solicitors appropriately in relation to that matter. 
     
      
    61 The income of the family has since 1998 come from the earnings of the plaintiff’s wife, royalties which he receives from his songs with “Australian Crawl” and from his disability pension. 
     
      
    62 The family moved back to Melbourne in July 2004. The plaintiff’s wife said that this was done because the plaintiff had family in Melbourne. That is where the plaintiff and his wife were residing at the time of trial. They were living in rented accommodation. The plaintiff had transferred his recording equipment from Sydney to Melbourne and had set up one of the rooms in the house as a recording studio. 
     
      
    63 As of the date of trial, the plaintiff was assisting some new bands in Melbourne in producing their songs. His difficulty in going into business as a producer of songs, the plaintiff explained, was a lack of confidence. Because it was so long since he had done this sort of work, he was concerned that he no longer had the necessary skills. He was also assisting a female singer and songwriter whom he had “discovered” and whom he believed had great talent.  
     
      
    64 A project which the plaintiff has in contemplation, if he had sufficient money, was to purchase a property where he could set up a music studio so that musicians could get away from the distractions of their daily work and focus on developing their music and making records. He thought the Mornington Peninsula would be an appropriate site. He pointed out that quality equipment these days was much cheaper than it had been (T. 250-251). 
     
      
    65 That was the plaintiff’s situation at the date of trial. 
     
      
       
      Liability 
       
       
      
    66 In May 1995 the Council entered into an agreement with AG Maitland Pty Limited, the second defendant, pursuant to which the second defendant would construct a roundabout and ancillary works at the intersection of Alfred and Fitzroy Streets, Milsons Point. The second defendant had been the successful tenderer for those works. The second defendant appears to have been regarded as a reputable company, experienced in the construction of road works at that time.  
     
      
    67 There was no appearance by the second defendant at trial. This is not surprising in view of a letter dated 13 January 2003 on the court file which indicated that the second defendant has not traded since 1999 and has been deregistered. Its insurer at the relevant time was FAI Insurance Limited, which has also somewhat notoriously gone into liquidation. The letter, which was signed by Bob Maitland, advised that at the time of its deregistration, the second defendant had no assets. 
     
      
    68 The Council appointed Mr Horace Marsh, an engineer, to supervise on its behalf the performance of the works by the second defendant. From his notes it seems that he attended the work site on most days that work was carried out. 
     
      
    69 It was agreed between the plaintiff and the Council that, in accordance with the authorities referred to in Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery [2005] NSWCA 432, where a road authority engages a contractor to do work on a road used by the public, such as to involve risk to the public unless reasonable care is exercised, the road authority has a duty to ensure reasonable care is exercised and the road authority will be liable if the contractor does not take reasonable care. In other words it was agreed that the duty owed by the Council to road users was non delegable.  
     
      
    70 The bald facts of the accident were that shortly before 1am on 20 July 1995 the plaintiff was driving his 1970 Mercedes motor vehicle in a southerly direction in Alfred Street in Milsons Point. As the plaintiff approached road works which were being undertaken at the intersection of Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street, his vehicle veered to the right, mounted the western kerb and collided with a telegraph pole. The major point of impact with the telegraph pole was the left rear door. There was a 25 metre tyre mark leading to the stationary vehicle. A blood alcohol sample taken approximately one hour after the accident showed that the plaintiff had a blood alcohol concentration of .133. 
     
      
    71 The plaintiff’s case on liability was that on 20 July 1995 there was a failure to comply with the Australian Standard 1742.3 (1985) (hereafter referred to as the Standard) in relation to the signposting and delineation of the road works at the intersection. As a result of that failure, confusion was likely to be created in the mind of a driver approaching those road works from the North, in particular as to whether or not the southbound lane through the intersection was blocked. Before dealing with the question of liability, it is necessary to make factual findings against which this question can be determined. 
     
      
    72 From the Council records it would seem that although work had been performed to realign the western kerb in June or early July 1995, work was not commenced on the centre island of the roundabout and the splitter islands before 17 July 1995. This is clear from the diary notes of Mr Marsh. The reason for the delay was the unavailability of suitable signs.  
     
      
    73 It was submitted on behalf of the Council that the intersection between Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street had operated as a roundabout for some weeks, if not months, before this accident. That proposition was put to the plaintiff’s liability witnesses. On no occasion was that proposition positively accepted. Some witnesses denied it, others said they could not remember or did not know and others agreed that this might have been the case. There was no evidence from the Council to that effect. The only evidence which might support such an inference was the existence of the two roundabout signs on the edge of the eastern kerb. There was, however, no evidence to indicate when those signs were erected. Their presence is equally consistent with them having been erected at or about the time when work was commenced at the intersection in anticipation of a roundabout ultimately being constructed there. In those circumstances I am not prepared to find that the intersection operated as a roundabout before 17 July 1995. 
     
      
    74 The evidence of the plaintiff and his wife was that there were three alternative routes, which he could take from the eastern suburbs to his residence. At the time of the accident, he was residing in Darley Street, Neutral Bay. One of these routes involved using Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street, but it was not the route which he normally used. I accept this evidence and I also accept the plaintiff when he said that prior to the night of the accident he was unaware of any road works at the intersection of Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street. 
     
      
    75 The only evidence as to how the road works were configured, what signs were erected and what other markings or indicia were present comes from photos, which were taken by the Crash Investigation Unit of the Police Service, from the evidence of three persons who regularly used Alfred Street and from the security guard who came to the assistance of the plaintiff, immediately following the accident. It was not clear when the police photos were taken. Quite clearly some were taken on the night of the accident and they require no further comment. Others appear to have been taken within a day or so of the accident. Since it was the practice of the Crash Investigation Unit to take such photographs as soon as possible after an accident, it is a reasonable inference that the daylight photographs were taken the following morning and I so find. There was no evidence of any change to the signage or configuration of the road works between the time of the accident (12.55am) and when the daylight photographs were taken. I accept that the daytime photographs show the situation as it was at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    76 In the police report the conditions at the accident site were described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Road surface was dry, weather fine, level gradient, one independent witness, visibility open, road works, partial lighting not operating, 60 km/h speed limit.” 
        
       
       
      In fact the gradient was not level. It was common ground that there was a general down grade of four degrees to the South from Burton Street and at about 30 metres before Fitzroy Street, the down grade changed to five degrees and continued at that level through the intersection. 
       
      
    77 The meaning of the phrase “partial lighting not operating” was not clear. Constable Dunn, who prepared the report, gave evidence. Understandably after more than ten years, his recollection was not particularly good. He did recall that the place where the accident occurred was “darker than normal” (T.453). He did not recall what he was referring to when he made the note “partial lighting not operating”. He thought he was referring to the streetlights. Under cross-examination it was suggested to him that the note referred to the light on the pole with which the vehicle had collided and that this light might have been damaged in the collision. Constable Dunn was not able to confirm or deny that proposition. The independent witness was the security guard who heard but did not see the accident. 
     
      
    78 I am only prepared to conclude that there may have been a part of the intersection which was darker than normal when Constable Dunn attended on the night of the accident, but the extent of that was never clarified. I am not prepared to find that lighting played any part in the occurrence of this accident. Even if there were a problem with the lighting, there was no evidence as to how long that problem had existed or whether, as was suggested, it had been caused by the accident itself. 
     
      
    79 For completeness it should be noted that in his notebook and subsequently in a plan prepared by him, Constable Dunn recorded a skid mark of approximately 25 metres in length from the centre line of Alfred Street towards the southwest to the place where the plaintiff’s vehicle ended up. He had measured that distance by pacing it out on the night of the accident. The experts were not able to conclude whether the skid mark represented braking or whether it indicated that the car had yawed while the driver was trying to change direction. The security guard, Mr Russell, referred to hearing “a squeal of brakes, tyres on the road” (T.425). I do not regard that evidence as decisive and am unable to conclude whether the plaintiff applied his brakes or not. 
     
      
    80 In relation to the speed of the vehicle, it was eventually agreed between the experts that if the plaintiff had braked fully before the collision then the likely maximum speed at which he was travelling was about 77 km/h and if he had not braked but the vehicle had yawed, the likely speed range would have been about 60-70 km/h at the point where the skid mark commenced. 
     
      
    81 The only clear evidence as to signs and other indicia which could warn drivers of the presence of the road works came from the photographs. They reveal that plastic web safety mesh was wrapped around the splitter island to the North of the intersection and also around the central roundabout island itself. This was coloured white and orange. There was a single red traffic cone positioned at the tip of the northern splitter island, but photograph C2 showed other red traffic cones behind and partially obscured by the plastic web safety mesh around that splitter island. 
     
      
    82 Three warning lights were depicted in the photographs as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Above the ‘keep left’ sign but facing away from it. 
       
      (ii) Facing towards southbound traffic in the centre of the webbing, relatively close to the first light (C3). 
       
      (iii) Attached to the trestle barrier bearing the sign ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’. There was no evidence as to whether this was a flashing light or not. 
       
       
      There were two chevron/trestle boards positioned in the eastern parking lane, one of which supported the sign previously referred to. 
       
      
    83 The following signs were shown in the photographs: 
     
      
       
      (i) A conventional black and yellow sign indicating a roundabout, positioned approximately 35-40 metres away from the commencement of the intersection.  
       
      (ii) A yellow and black sign ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ supported by a trestle board in the eastern parking lane positioned approximately 25 metres to the North of the commencement of the intersection. 
       
      (iii) A black and white roundabout sign positioned on the edge of the footpath at the commencement of the intersection. 
       
      (iv) A vertical black and white sign ‘keep left’ positioned next to the red traffic cone at the northern end of the splitter island, but half a metre to the East of it.  
       
      
    84 Because the ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ sign was positioned in the eastern parking lane and was not raised above car level, it was suggested by the plaintiff’s experts that on the night of the accident it may well have been obscured by a parked car. While I accept that the positioning of this sign did not comply with the Standard and that it could have been obscured by a parked car so as not to be seen by a driver travelling South in Alfred Street, I am not prepared to find that it was so obscured. There was simply no evidence as to the presence of parked cars in that part of Alfred Street at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    85 Mr Morrison, a traffic engineer retained on behalf of the plaintiff, based his opinion not only upon the Standard but also upon the RTA manual for ‘traffic control at work sites’. It was his opinion that a road authority in the position of the Council supervising road works of this kind should have had regard not only to the Standard but also to this RTA manual. I disagree. As Mr Stuart-Smith, the traffic engineer retained on behalf of the Council pointed out, this manual had only been published in June 1995. Consequently not only was it unreasonable to expect the Council to have regard to it in mid July 1995, but it was unlikely that the Council would have had access to the document at that time. In any event the purpose of the document was rather different to that of the Standard. Much of it was directed to the safety of RTA personnel or contractors carrying out road works. 
     
      
    86 It follows from my rejection of the RTA manual as an appropriate guide for the delineation of these road works that I do not accept that the failure of the Council to have in place a separate document entitled ‘traffic control plan’ in relation to these road works amounted to negligence. I accept the opinion of Mr Stuart-Smith who said that in 1995 it was comparatively rare for Local Councils to prepare such a document in respect of road works of this kind. 
     
      
    87 Implicit in the two reports by Mr Morrison is the assumption that the signs and devices depicted in the police photographs were the only indicia of the road works at the site. I am not prepared to make that assumption. There may well have been other signs or indicia, which were not photographed by the police. Having said that, however, I am not prepared to draw any inference in favour of the Council that such other signs or indicia as may have been present but not photographed, would have had any effect on the occurrence of this accident. There is simply no evidence one way or the other and to go further than that which is depicted in the photographs would involve unwarranted speculation. 
     
      
    88 The Council was not able to provide information as to the existence of other signs or indicia of the road works beyond those depicted in the photographs. Exhibit V, which was a letter from the Council to a firm of solicitors Messrs Curwood and Partners dated 19 February 1998, indicated the extent of the material available to the Council at that time. From that letter one can infer that from at least 1997 inquiries were being made by the Council as to the relationship between these road works and the plaintiff’s accident. It seems to me to be a reasonable inference that if the Council had evidence of other signs beyond those depicted in the photographs which may have had some effect on the occurrence of this accident, it would have produced that evidence. Neither side called the Council contract works engineer who was supervising the road works, Mr Horace Marsh. 
     
      
    89 There was considerable debate between the experts as to what use should be made of the Standard and the extent to which the signs shown in the police photographs complied with the Standard. It seems to me that compliance with the Standard is not decisive in determining whether or not negligence has been established. The Standard operates as a useful guide as to what at the time was regarded as good practice when erecting signs and other indicia of road works so as to appropriately warn, inform and guide motorists who could be expected to negotiate such road works. 
     
      
    90 Because the specific problems created by these road works were not expressly covered by an example in the Standard, Mr Morrison tried to find an example which came closest. He chose figure 5.7 which indicated the signs and other indicia which should be used with a four-lane road which had a centre lane fully closed. As Mr Stuart-Smith pointed out, because that example required motorists to make a substantial lateral movement, lateral shift markers (LSMs) or other clear indicators that a lateral movement was necessary, would need to be installed on the approaches to those road works. Mr Stuart-Smith thought that no such need existed in relation to these road works because there was not a lateral movement such as was shown in the example. 
     
      
    91 While I accept the criticism of Mr Stuart-Smith that this example in the Standard was not on all fours with the particular road works under consideration, I also accept the approach of Mr Jamieson that if an exact example was not available in the Standard, what ought be done by a traffic authority was to comply as best it could with the principles of road works, signposting and delineation set out in the Standard. 
     
      
    92 Exhibit U comprised a plan of these road works as they were to be constructed in 1995. It is clear from that plan that the central island in the roundabout is not positioned in the centre of Alfred Street but is significantly to the East of that centre point and substantially encroaches onto the southbound lane of Alfred Street. To safely negotiate the road works relating to the splitter island and the central island in the roundabout would of necessity involve a significant lateral movement to the East for southbound motorists. Such a movement would not be as great as in figure 5.7 of the Standard, but it would be significant. In my opinion, compliance with the principles in the Standard did require the positioning of some form of LSMs or other device to make it clear to motorists heading South in Alfred Street that there was a change requiring a significant lateral move to the East in order to negotiate the road works. 
     
      
    93 In his reports and in his evidence, Mr Stuart-Smith placed considerable weight on photographs 1-4 in his report of 11 February 2005. Those comprised four photographs taken at approximately 10pm from various distances to the North of the intersection of Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street starting at 100 metres away and reducing to 25 metres. In relation to those photographs, I agree with the criticism by Mr Jamieson that the photographs appear to be slightly over exposed and therefore produce an effect somewhat brighter than the naked eye would see. Nevertheless they provide broad guidance as to the difficulties for a motorist in making precise observations when driving at night in that direction.  
     
      
    94 It was the evidence of Mr Stuart-Smith that by a close examination of photograph 3 (taken 50 metres away from the commencement of the intersection), it was clear that although the central island of the roundabout did significantly intrude upon the southbound lane of Alfred Street, one could clearly see a gap between the end of the central island and the commencement of the entrance into Fitzroy Street. That evidence assumed that the coloured mesh surrounding the central island would have been positioned very close to its final dimensions (which was not established but which could be inferred from the positioning of the mesh around the northern splitter island). 
     
      
    95 While I agree with Mr Stuart-Smith that a close examination of that photograph does allow such a conclusion to be drawn, I doubt very much that a driver heading South in Alfred Street at a speed in the order of 60 km/h would have had time to make such a close examination. That driver would be depending upon impression as much as exact observation given the time of night. If the driver were travelling at a faster speed, or if his faculties were adversely affected by disability or alcohol, then such an accurate observation would be all the more difficult. Contrary to the evidence of Mr Stuart-Smith, I am of the opinion that photograph 3 makes it clear how difficult it would have been for a driver heading South in Alfred Street at night to determine whether the southbound lane was blocked or not when both the North splitter island and the central island of the roundabout were surrounded with orange and white safety mesh. 
     
      
    96 A view of the intersection was conducted on the afternoon of 20 March 2006. The benefit to be gained from the view was limited in that it seemed to be generally accepted by the parties that there had been changes to the intersection and in particular to parts of the central island and splitter islands between 1995 and the date of the view. The exact nature of the changes was not known. What the view did emphasise was the effect of the slope in Alfred Street, particularly in the 30 metres immediately before the intersection with Fitzroy Street. The view confirmed the impression given by the photographs that this slope does reduce the level of observation available to a driver travelling South in Alfred Street. The night photographs taken by Mr Stuart-Smith emphasised that this reduction in vision increased at night. 97 Apart from the need for some form of LSMs, the expert witnesses were at issue as to the adequacy of the signs and their positioning. By reference to the perception reaction time of a driver travelling South in Alfred Street, the plaintiff’s experts concluded that the sign ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ was too close to the intersection to provide adequate warning. It was generally agreed that this sign was positioned approximately 25 metres to the North of the commencement of the intersection. 
     
      
    98 The experts identified a distance before the road works as the “critical zone”. They disagreed as to the extent of this zone but the concept was accepted. There had to be sufficient distance within the zone to enable a motorist heading South in Alfred Street to perceive the presence of the road works and react adequately to them. That reaction would involve a change in speed and/or a change in direction. It seems to have been accepted that the average reaction time for a normally alert driver is approximately 1.5 seconds. Where the object in relation to which the driver needs to be alerted is unusual the reaction time can be considerably greater. Reaction times increase at night. It goes without saying that the reaction time for an intoxicated driver would also be greater. 
     
      
    99 The plaintiff’s experts were of the opinion that the apparent blocking of the southbound lane, which was the impression created by the configuration of these road works, was so unusual as to produce an extended reaction time of at least 2.5 seconds and probably more. Consequently the ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ sign was much too close to the intersection to have the effect of providing adequate warning. By the time a driver saw it, he or she would have been too close to the road works to react adequately and in any event, in the absence of LSMs, it provided insufficient information as to the problem created by the road works. 
     
      
    100 Mr Stuart-Smith conceded that the Standard specified that the Advance Warning Sign should be between 40-80 metres from the commencement of the works for speeds less than 60 km/h. He relied upon the first black and yellow roundabout sign to fulfil that function since it was located approximately 40 metres away from the road works.  
     
      
    101 It seems clear, even on the approach of Mr Stuart-Smith, that the ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ sign was too close to the intersection and road works to comply with the Standard. The conventional black and yellow roundabout sign would not operate as a warning. It was a conventional traffic sign which would not particularly attract the attention of a southbound driver at night. It would certainly not alert a southbound driver to the fact that something unusual was occurring ahead such as road works which gave the impression that the southbound lane was blocked. 
     
      
    102 It was agreed between the parties that the ‘keep left’ sign did not comply with the Standard. It was vertically oriented and the lettering was smaller than the Standard recommended. I also agree with the criticism that at night it would be very hard to read from a distance and would tend to merge with the mesh behind it. It is not without significance that in photograph C2 this sign appears as simply a white post. 
     
      
    103 It was the opinion of the plaintiff’s experts, based on photographs C1, C2 and exhibit U, that for a driver approaching the road works from the North in Alfred Street at night, the mesh surrounding the northern splitter island and the central island would give an impression that the southbound lane was blocked. There was nothing in the signage (except the vertical ‘keep left’ sign) to indicate otherwise. It was their opinion that a reasonable response by a southbound driver would be to think that the only way through the intersection was to drive through the roundabout on its western side, ie on the incorrect side of the road. The fact that the southbound lane still remained open would not be obvious until the driver was almost into the intersection. In those circumstances, as Mr Jamieson put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is therefore considered that if a driver was approaching this site at (say) 65 km/h and moved across to the oncoming northbound lane, a predictable response to this “wrong” decision would be to heavily brake or turn the wheel to re-enter the southbound lane. Either action would produce a “yawing” movement of the vehicle – which would then result in a sideways skid and an impact with the pole positioned on the western side of Alfred Street.” 
        
       
      
    104 I appreciate that it is dangerous to reach conclusions based on photographs. What they depict is often different to that which the human eye sees. In this case it is clear that photographs C1 and C2 were taken from the kerbside lane and not from the centre lane where a southbound driver would be positioned. When the view was conducted, I placed myself in the kerbside lane at approximately the position from where the photographs were taken and then in the southbound driver’s lane in order to assess the difference in perspective. While such a difference existed, it was not particularly great. Accordingly, I have formed the opinion that photographs C1 and C2 do give a reasonably accurate impression of the perspective, which a southbound driver would have had of the road works, even though the photos were taken in the kerbside lane. 
     
      
    105 Based on that, and on the opinion of the plaintiff’s experts and on photographs 1-4 in Mr Stuart-Smith’s report of 11 February 2005, ie the four photographs taken at night, I am of the opinion that to a driver travelling South in Alfred Street at approximately 12.55am on 20 July 1995 the road works would have given an impression that the southbound lane was entirely blocked and that this impression would not have been corrected until the driver was very close, ie within 25 metres from the commencement of the intersection. On that issue I accept the opinion of the plaintiff’s experts in preference to that of Mr Stuart-Smith. 
     
      
    106 Evidence was given by some persons who regularly used Alfred Street in 1995 as to their observations of these road works. Mr Boursicot owned a building in Alfred Street. He used visit the building 3-4 times per week. He clearly remembered the first occasion that he became aware of the road works. He was travelling South in Alfred Street to visit a friend who lived in Kirribilli. He could not remember what signs were present. He remembered what he described as barriers with yellow colours. He gained the impression that the southbound lane was blocked and it was only when he slowed down, very close to the intersection, that he became aware that the southbound lane was still open. Until then he thought that it was necessary to drive to the West, ie on the incorrect side of the road to go through the intersection. This observation by him was made during daylight hours. 
     
      
    107 Mr Haldezos ran a restaurant in Alfred Street. He used drive South in Alfred Street through the intersection between 4am and 4.30am each morning. It was at this time of the day when his headlights were on that he first became aware of the road works. He described their colouring as red and white. When he approached the road works he thought the southbound lane was blocked and he drove through the intersection to the West, ie on the incorrect side of the road. It was only when he was passing through the intersection that he realised that the southbound lane was still open. He could not remember any signs being present without the assistance of the photographs. He did not slow down when entering the intersection. 
     
      
    108 Mr Cappie travelled to and from work by car every day in 1995 down Alfred Street, through the intersection with Fitzroy Street. He remembered when the construction of the roundabout commenced, although he could not offer a precise date. When travelling South in Alfred Street he had the impression that the southbound lane was blocked. He had no difficulty passing through the intersection because he slowed down.109 Mr Russell was a security guard who was present in the offices of Kimberly-Clarke at 52 Alfred Street on the night of the accident. He heard what he thought were the squeal of brakes and a thump. From a balcony, which extended over Alfred Street, he saw the plaintiff’s car almost below him against the pole. It was his evidence that in the days before the accident when he was present in that building at about that time of night, on three or four occasions he heard drivers applying their brakes hard in circumstances where he believed they were travelling South in Alfred Street. It should be noted that he did not actually see this happen, but was relying upon what he heard. The view revealed that the balcony to which Mr Russell referred was positioned close to the intersection, overlooking it. He thought that the mesh had only been in position for a few days before the accident.110 That evidence, particularly from Mr Haldezos, confirmed the conclusion, which I arrived at from my own consideration of the photographs, my inspection of the site at the view and my analysis of the competing evidence from the experts. It seems that for the first few days after work was commenced on the central island of the roundabout, the road works were so configured that they were capable of giving the impression to drivers travelling South in Alfred Street that the southbound lane was blocked at the intersection. The signage in place at the time does not seem to have altered that impression for those drivers who gave evidence. 
     
      
    111 Against that factual background, what are the legal principles which determine liability? The appropriate test is that set out in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council (2001) 206 CLR 512. 
     
      
    112 At p 577 [para 150] the majority stated the duty in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “150 The duty which arises under the common law of Australia may now be considered. Authorities having statutory powers of the nature of those conferred by the LG Act upon the present respondents to design or construct roads, or carry out works or repairs upon them, are obliged to take reasonable care that their exercise of or failure to exercise those powers does not create a foreseeable risk of harm to a class of persons (road users) which includes the plaintiff. Where the state of a roadway, whether from design, construction, works or non-repair, poses a risk to that class of persons, then, to discharge its duty of care, an authority with power to remedy the risk is obliged to take reasonable steps by the exercise of its powers within a reasonable time to address the risk. If the risk be unknown to the authority or latent and only discoverable by inspection, then to discharge its duty of care an authority having power to inspect is obliged to take reasonable steps to ascertain the existence of latent dangers which might reasonably be suspected to exist.” 
        
       
      
    113 Is the duty there articulated owed only to careful road users? The authorities suggest not. In a case, the facts of which bear a similarity to these, Deane J (with whom Gaudron and McHugh JJ agreed) made it clear that the duty was owed to persons who were not careful road users. 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the second respondent was in a relationship of proximity with other users of the road on which he left the truck. That relationship gave rise to a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable injury to such other road users. That relationship and that duty of care were not confined to persons who were careful and sober but extended to all foreseeable users of the road, including bad and inattentive drivers and those whose faculties were impaired either naturally or by reason of the effect of alcohol.”  
        (March v Stramare 
         (1990-1991) 171 CLR 506 at 520).

      Clarke v Coleambally Ski Club Inc 
       [2004] NSWCA 376 at [26-28]. 
       
      
    114 The Council sought to distinguish this dicta on the basis that it applied only to the obligations of one driver to another. It was submitted that Brodie was authority for the proposition that a road authority only owed a duty to those using a road who took ordinary care. The Council cited cases where the duty of a council to pedestrians was stated in those terms. 
     
      
    115 I do not read Brodie in that way. It seems to me that Brodie draws a distinction between the duty owed to a road user in a vehicle and pedestrians. The point of distinction is obvious. A pedestrian because of his or her mode of locomotion has more time and more opportunity to examine the surface over which he or she is walking (Brodie [163]). Those advantages are usually not enjoyed by a motorist who is necessarily travelling at a greater speed and who may have other impediments to his or her vision. (See also Edson v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] NSWCA 68 at [91]). 
     
      
    116 It seems to me that the duty owed by a road authority to motorists is not restricted only to those taking ordinary care. I cannot see why as a matter of logic there should be a distinction between the duty owed by one motorist to another (as in March v Stramare) and that owed by a road authority to a motorist. This is particularly so when in March v Stramare one of the vehicles had been left in a dangerous position.  
     
      
    117 The difficulty is to determine what are the appropriate limits to the duty. This is not a task which I propose to embark upon. It may well be impossible to specify precise limits in that each particular case will have to be looked at in accordance with its own facts. What does seem clear, however, is that the duty does extend beyond persons who are careful and sober when using the road and it ought have regard to inadvertence and thoughtlessness and those whose faculties are impaired, either naturally or by reason of the effects of alcohol. The grey area is the extent to which a road authority has to have regard to those persons. As was pointed out in Brodie ([161]) it is the precise nature of the defect which is important when considering the question of those persons to whom the duty extends. 
     
      
    118 On this issue I respectfully accept the analysis of Brodie by Bryson JA: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I respectfully observe that their Honours had not earlier formulated the duty in terms which required that a road be safe only for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety, although the terms of that sentence suggest that they had. In paras [150] to [152] there is no limitation of this kind to the class of road users to whom a duty is owed. The earlier formulation referring to persons using the road and themselves taking ordinary care is found in para [160] dealing with questions of breach of duty. 
        
       
       
        
        63 What their Honours said at [160] treats the proposition that persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care as the starting point when dealing with questions of breach of duty, not questions of the existence of duty, and if there were no duty towards persons who do not exercise reasonable care for their own safety there would be no room for taking the results of inadvertence and thoughtlessness into account as a variable factor. In my respectful view it is not a correct reading of the leading judgment, notwithstanding the terms of the opening sentence of para [163], that Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ intended to establish a qualification which would override what might otherwise be the result of the application of the Shirt Calculus to the facts, and would exclude pedestrians who do not take reasonable care for their own safety from any duty of care which might otherwise be owed by highway authorities to pedestrians.” ( 
        Sutherland Shire Council v Henshaw 
         [2004] NSWCA 386 at [62-63]). 
        
       
      
    119 Applying those principles, the Council as a road authority and as the entity supervising the road works through its servant Mr Marsh, owed a duty to the plaintiff to take reasonable care not to create a foreseeable risk of harm to him as a motorist. In fulfilling that duty it also had to take into account the possibility that as a motorist the plaintiff might be inattentive, might be driving too fast in the circumstances and that his faculties might be impaired, at least to the extent that his reactions were slowed. 
     
      
    120 It was foreseeable, as the Council appreciated, that unless appropriate signage and other indicia were put in position, the road works at the intersection of Alfred Street and Fitzroy Street could create a risk of harm to road users. On that analysis alone there was an obligation to properly signify and delineate the fact and nature of the road works. 
     
      
    121 The matter can be looked at in another way. Once the road works were commenced and surrounded by safety mesh, further content was given to the duty. An obligation arose to check that the signage and other insignia used were adequate to achieve the original purpose of not creating a foreseeable risk of harm to road users. That common law duty is in line with clause 2.5.7 of the Standard: 
     
      
       
        
        “On completion of the erection of the signs and devices and after any change is made in the arrangement, supervisory personnel should carry out an inspection before and after opening to traffic. This inspection should be carried out at the normal traffic speed, along the travel path, and past all of the signs and devices. The same inspection should be carried out at night with dipped headlights. If it is considered that the arrangement is confusing or unsatisfactory, it should be adjusted and reinspected.” 
        
       
      
    122 It follows from the findings of fact which I have made that after the road works had been commenced and the various warning devices shown in the photographs had been placed in position, it was reasonably foreseeable that drivers travelling South in Alfred Street might gain the impression from the signage and overall configuration of the works that the southbound lane was blocked and act accordingly. That such was a foreseeable risk was readily ascertainable by Mr Marsh had he travelled South in Alfred Street and made his own assessment. This was something which he was obliged to do when performing his function as supervising engineer on behalf of the Council.  
     
      
    123 This same proposition was put slightly differently by Hodgson JA: 
     
      
       
        
        “25 It can be said that a road authority that undertakes work on a road involving risk to road users is so placed in relation to road users as to assume a particular responsibility for their safety. 
        
       
       
        
        26 I do not think  
        Brodie 
         stands against this approach. The general duty of road authorities is to take reasonable care; but in the particular circumstances where the road authority undertakes work involving risk to road users, a circumstance not considered in  
        Brodie 
        , that general duty is overlaid by the more extensive duty that arises because of the risk created by the undertaking of those works. In my opinion, until the High Court says otherwise, this Court should follow  
        Scroop, Fletcher, Palmer  
        and  
        Ainger, 
         and apply that principle.”  
        (Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery 
         [2005] NSWCA 432 [25-26]). 
        
       
      
    124 Here it was foreseeable that the configuration of the road works, together with the absence of adequate signs and markings, would create a foreseeable risk of harm to road users exercising reasonable care. The risk was greater, and therefore more likely to occur, in the case of an inattentive driver, a driver travelling at more than 60 km/h or a driver whose faculties were impaired for whatever reason. What was a reasonable response by the Council? Again assistance is provided by Brodie: 
     
      
       
        
        “151 The perception of the response by the authority calls for, to adapt a statement by Mason J in  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
        , a consideration of various matters; in particular, the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability that it will occur, the expense, difficulty and inconvenience to the authority in taking the steps described above to alleviate the danger, and any other competing or conflicting responsibility or commitments of the authority. The duty does not extend to ensuring the safety of road users in all circumstances. In the application of principle much thus will turn upon the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in each particular case. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        155 The question whether “due care and skill” was taken in design or construction will require consideration of all the circumstances of the case. The circumstances will include the type and volume of traffic expected. Different roads will serve different purposes and need not be constructed to the same standard …” 
        
       
       
        
        “159 The discharge of the duty involves the taking by the authority of reasonable steps to prevent there remaining a source of risk which gives rise to a foreseeable risk of harm. Such a risk of harm may arise from a failure to repair a road or its surface, from the creation of conditions during or as a result of repairs or works, from a failure to remove unsafe items in or near a road or from the placing of items upon a road which create a danger or the removal of items which protect against danger. 
        
       
       
        
        160 In dealing with questions of breach of duty, whilst there is to be taken into account as a “variable factor” the results of “inadvertence” and “thoughtlessness”, a proper starting point may be the proposition that the persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care. 
        
       
       
        
        161 … On the other hand, a trench in the roadway, whether arising from active digging or decay of the road or structures within it, will more readily give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury, particularly where it cannot easily be seen or avoided by a road user. The nature of the defect, and not the question of whether it arose by action or “nonfeasance”, should be significant …” 
        
       
      
    125 It is not without significance that the majority in Brodie refer to the proposition that persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care may be an appropriate starting point ([160]), but did not indicate that such was an appropriate end point. It was a factor to be taken into account when balancing the competing considerations in Shirt.  
     
      
    126 The magnitude of the risk, in my opinion, was considerable. Confusion in the mind of a motorist could lead to serious injury or death. The degree of probability of occurrence raises the issue of the extent to which bad drivers need to be considered when assessing what is a reasonable response to the foreseeable risk. Quite obviously a road authority does not have to plan for extremes of conduct where drivers might be travelling at very high speeds or whose faculties are so dulled by ill health or substance abuse as to not be able to properly control a motor vehicle. The response, however, does need to have some regard to not only carelessness and inadvertence but also excessive speed and reduced alertness, either as a result of ill health or alcohol consumption. Accident statistics make it clear that excessive speed and excessive alcohol consumption are all too common on the part of motorists. 
     
      
    127 There was no suggestion by the Council that the expense, difficulty and inconvenience associated with better signage and indicia relating to the road works were beyond either its resources or those of the second defendant. There were no other competing or conflicting responsibilities or commitments identified in the evidence. 
     
      
    128 By application of the Shirt principle, I am of the opinion that the response of the Council was unreasonable. Given the nature of the works and the fact that they would substantially encroach onto the southbound lane in Alfred Street, the signage and other indicia were inadequate to sufficiently place motorists on notice that there would be a significant lateral movement to the East. The vertical ‘keep left’ sign was patently inadequate. The only other sign which indicated that anything unusual was occurring (leaving aside the conventional roundabout signs which would not have had that effect) was the ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ sign which was not only too close, but failed to provide sufficient information. Both signs failed to comply with the Standard. 
     
      
    129 An inspection by Mr Marsh (if one had taken place and if it had been carried out with due care and skill) would have revealed that for drivers in Alfred Street travelling South, a confusing and ambiguous situation had been created. Even if the need for obvious and clear signs including LSMs was not apparent before the works were actually commenced, this should have become obvious once the work commenced and the coloured mesh was put in place. 
     
      
    130 The problem with these road works or the “defect” was that they gave the impression to a southbound driver that the southbound lane was blocked. This was the effect created in daylight. It would have been greater at night. As Mr Jamieson’s evidence made clear, while the coloured mesh would have made it clear to a southbound driver that road works were present, that factor itself together with the ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ sign, which was too close to the works, did not provide any indication of the precise dilemma which would confront that southbound driver as he or she got closer to the works. As the driver approached the works the perception would have been that the southbound lane was blocked. The decision to be made was whether to reduce speed and/or change direction. It was only when such a driver was quite close to the intersection that the true position would be revealed. Drivers such as Messrs Haldezos and Boursicot indicated that this would occur much closer to the intersection than did the experts. It also needs to be kept in mind that at a speed of 60 km/h a motor vehicle would cover 16.7 metres in one second. 
     
      
    131 Although the Standard is not determinative of negligence, it did provide a useful guide as to good practice. It is clear that the two most informative signs, ie ‘changed traffic conditions ahead’ and ‘keep left’ did not comply with it. There was no indication such as LSMs that the southbound lane remained open and that a southbound driver should expect to move laterally to the East. This was not a situation where the evidence established only that more could have been done. The combination of the configuration of the road works with the inadequate signage created a confusing and ambiguous situation. In a dynamic circumstance involving drivers travelling at night at speeds of 60 km/h or more, such ambiguity and confusion became a source of danger. More signs, better positioned and containing more information such LSMs were required to reduce this danger. The Council was accordingly in breach of the duty which it owed to the plaintiff. 
     
      
    132 That does not end the matter. The circumstances of this accident raise causation issues.  
     
      
    133 The first problem is that the precise mechanism of the accident is not known. The only material we have is the 25 metre skid mark and the final resting position of the car. From the damage to the car and the skid mark, estimates have been made as to the possible speed of the car at the commencement of the skid mark depending upon whether the brakes were applied or whether the car commenced to yaw at that point. The Council submits that on those facts, there was insufficient evidence to establish that the configuration of the road works and the inadequacy of the signage and other markings contributed to the accident. Speed and the plaintiff’s consumption of alcohol, it was submitted, provided a full explanation for the accident.  
     
      
    134 I agree that the evidence is sparse. There might be more force in the submissions of the Council had the plaintiff collided directly with the road works or ended up to the East of the road works. The existence of the skid mark heading towards the West, together with the final resting place of the vehicle does, it seems to me, enable an inference to be drawn that there was some confusion in the plaintiff’s mind as to the correct route through the intersection and that at some point in the decision making process he had intended to travel to the West on the incorrect side of the road. There seems to me to be a real plausibility in the scenario suggested by Mr Jamieson at [para 103]. The fact that the Council did breach the duty, which it owed to the plaintiff coupled with those considerations, enables me to infer that the configuration of the road works, together with the inadequacy of the signage and other indicia were a cause of the plaintiff’s accident. 
     
      
    135 The Council further submitted that because of the range of speeds calculated by the experts at which the plaintiff was travelling at the point when the skid commenced, he would not have been able to safely negotiate the corner in any event and probably would have crashed. There is an element of circularity in that submission. The inadequacy of the signage and absence of LSMs and other indicia as to the nature of the road works may well have accounted for the plaintiff’s speed at that point in time. That is part of the complaint made by the plaintiff.  
     
      
    136 Another consideration on the question of causation is whether or not better and more explicit signage and other indicia as to the nature of the road works would have prevented the accident. In other words in his intoxicated state, would the plaintiff have paid any attention to better and more explicit signage and indicia?  
     
      
    137 It seems to me that one can never say that signage would have prevented a particular event occurring. At best signage operates to minimise and reduce the risk. Even though the plaintiff’s faculties were adversely affected by alcohol at the time of this accident, there is no evidence to suggest that he was not endeavouring to keep a proper lookout as best his intoxicated state would allow. He had apparently safely driven from Paddington on the night of the accident. The evidence as to the plaintiff’s driving before the accident did not suggest that he was a reckless driver or that he ignored road traffic signs. The range of speeds estimated by the experts at which the plaintiff was likely to have been travelling before his vehicle began to slow, although in excess of the speed limit, was not so high as to indicate a driver who would not pay attention to clear and obvious road signs. I am satisfied that had better and more clear signage and other indicia such as LSMs been present in Alfred Street to the North of the intersection on the night of the accident the plaintiff would have had regard to it. 
     
      
    138 An important consideration on the issue of causation is that the risk which was created by the road works, ie of a driver becoming confused by the configuration of the road works because of inadequate signage and other indicia is the very risk which appears to have eventuated judging from the direction of the skid mark and the final position of the car. (Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 238 para 8). Gaudron J there referred with approval to what Dixon J said in Betts v Whittingslowe (1945) 71 CLR 637 at 649: 
     
      
       
        
        “Breach of duty coupled with an accident of the kind that might thereby be caused is enough to justify an inference, in the absence of any sufficient reason to the contrary, that in fact the accident did occur owing to the act or omission amounting to the breach.” 
        
       
       
      Contributory negligence 
       
      
    139 The Council relied upon the plaintiff being adversely affected by alcohol, travelling at an excessive speed in the circumstances and failing to keep a proper lookout, to establish contributory negligence. The evidence of the two experts, Mr Moynham and Professor Starmer, was that excessive consumption of alcohol would affect both the other particulars in that alcohol induced disinhibition, often led to excessive speed and excess alcohol reduced perception.  
     
      
    140 The only clear information which we have in relation to the plaintiff’s alcohol consumption on the night of the accident is that the accident occurred at 12.55am and that a blood sample was taken from the plaintiff at 1.45am. That blood sample recorded a reading of .133 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The plaintiff gave evidence that he had an isolated recollection of the night. He said that he had a recollection of playing a joke on a barmaid at some point in the night and pretending to be drunk. He could not remember at what time in the night this occurred, nor where it had occurred. There has been no prior reference to that recollection in any of the material placed before me covering the last eleven years. If it is a genuine recollection I do not regard it as accurate and I propose to disregard it. 
     
      
    141 The only other evidence as to what happened that night comes from the plaintiff’s friend, Mr Peach. His evidence was that he and some other friends had arranged to meet the plaintiff at a hotel in Paddington for some celebratory occasion. It was his recollection that they were celebrating someone’s birthday but he could not be definite. When Mr Peach arrived at the hotel between 7.30 and 8pm the plaintiff was already present. When Mr Peach and his wife left between 10 and 10.30pm the plaintiff was still there. Mr Peach remembered purchasing four alcoholic drinks for the plaintiff during the course of the night and he also had a clear recollection that the plaintiff stopped drinking approximately 30 to 45 minutes before he and his wife left. He was unable to say whether the plaintiff consumed any alcohol after they left. 
     
      
    142 He said the plaintiff was not a heavy drinker but on the occasions that he went out with the plaintiff, the plaintiff would drink with others on a reasonably steady basis. From time to time he had gone out to dinner with the plaintiff and on some of those occasions both of them might have been regarded as being drunk at the end of the night. He was unable to say how much alcohol the plaintiff had consumed on the night of the accident.  
     
      
    143 The plaintiff’s wife gave evidence that she remembered an occasion early in their relationship, perhaps 1989-1990, when he had been drinking steadily all night and yet at 2am he appeared to her to be quite lucid and able to conduct an intelligent conversation. The plaintiff gave evidence that he had a high tolerance for alcohol. 
     
      
    144 I am not prepared to find that the plaintiff had a high tolerance to alcohol. The observations of Mr Peach do not bear that out. Even if the plaintiff did demonstrate some high tolerance to alcohol in 1989 or 1990, that says little about his tolerance in July 1995. 
     
      
    145 The evidence of Mrs Binks and Mr Peach was that the plaintiff was not a heavy drinker in the months leading up to the accident. To build a tolerance to alcohol of the kind which would reduce a person’s level of impairment at high levels of consumption, a person would have to be drinking alcohol at the rate of 10 standard drinks per day on a regular basis according to Professor Starmer. The plaintiff did not come within that category.  
     
      
    146 A number of scenarios were suggested particularly in the report of Mr Moynham of 1 August 1999 as to the likely level of alcohol in the plaintiff’s blood at the time of the accident given that the blood sample was not taken until 1.45am, ie almost one hour after the accident. None of the assumptions upon which those scenarios were based was made out in the evidence. If in fact the plaintiff did cease consuming alcohol at about 10.45pm then the alcohol in his system would have been reducing at the time of the accident and accordingly its level would have been higher at that time than that recorded in the blood sample. As indicated, however, one cannot know whether the plaintiff consumed alcohol after Mr Peach and his wife left the hotel. 
     
      
    147 On that state of the evidence it is impossible to make any precise finding as to the blood alcohol level of the plaintiff at the time of the accident. What does seem clear is that he was well affected by alcohol at the time of the accident. One of the scenarios suggested by Mr Moynham - that the plaintiff commenced his consumption of alcohol at 8pm and ceased just prior to commencing to drive home, ie some time shortly after midnight, fits in a very general way with the evidence of Mr Peach. On that scenario Mr Moynham assessed the plaintiff’s most likely blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident at .125. It seems to me that the plaintiff’s blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was at least at that level and may well have been higher. The likely range put by Professor Starmer was between .141 and .15 at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    148 A blood alcohol level of at least .125 would have adversely affected the plaintiff’s ability to drive safely in a significant way. It would have influenced the speed at which he was travelling because of the reduced perception of risk. It would have affected his ability to keep a proper lookout in that his peripheral vision would have been affected and information processing slowed down. Similarly, his reaction time would have been slowed. There is no issue between Professor Starmer and Mr Moynham on these issues. 
     
      
    149 Following the objective approach prescribed in Joslyn v Berryman & Anor (2003) 214 CLR 552 it is clear that the plaintiff by allowing his ability to drive to be so adversely affected by the consumption of alcohol, failed to take reasonable care for his own safety and that contributory negligence has been established. 
     
      
    150 The approach to be followed when apportioning liability is set out in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Limited (1985) ALJR 492 at 494. A court has to consider the relative contribution of the parties to the occurrence of the incident and to also consider their relative culpability. When taking both those matters into consideration, the scales weigh heavily against the plaintiff. 
     
      
    151 Although I have found liability on the part of the Council, it seems to me that the conduct of the plaintiff in significantly reducing his ability to safely control his motor vehicle in the way set out in para [148] made a greater contribution to the occurrence of the accident than did the configuration of the road works and the inadequate warning signs. It also seems to me that the moral culpability of the plaintiff in rendering himself unfit to drive safely is greater than the carelessness of the Council in the layout of the road works. 
     
      
    152 Taking those matters into account, I assess the plaintiff’s contributory negligence at 65% and his damages will be reduced accordingly. 
     
      
       
      DAMAGES 
       
      
    153 Because of the date of the accident, the plaintiff’s damages are to be assessed under the common law without statutory restrictions. 
     
      
       
      General damages 
      
    154 In order to assess the plaintiff’s general damages, it is necessary to determine with some precision the injuries which he suffered in the accident. Except for the plaintiff’s headaches there is little dispute as to the physical consequences of the accident. There was no real issue that the plaintiff suffered a degree of permanent brain damage in the accident, but its extent was in dispute. 
     
      
    155 The plaintiff has been left with sensory loss on the right side of his body and a reduction in his ability to use his right hand in fine movements. Although he has been able to resume playing the guitar, that disability has prevented him regaining the high level of skill which he had before the accident. That is a loss which is keenly felt by him. 
     
      
    156 Although he is able to walk and even run, he does have a high level balance loss which can lead to him losing his balance unless he is careful. There is a small degree of facial asymmetry on the left side. I am not persuaded that his occasional slurring of speech is due to brain damage. I believe it is due to the substantial quantities of medication which he has been taking. 
     
      
    157 One of the issues at trial was whether the plaintiff’s headaches, which he now experiences, were a continuation of those headaches from which he was suffering at the time of the accident or whether they were something new and a direct product of the accident. Surprisingly, there is no medical opinion on this question.  
     
      
    158 The plaintiff is currently taking a substantial cocktail of medication on a daily basis (T.227-229). He takes Doloxene and Codeine for pain. I assume that this is a reference to his headaches. He takes Acimax for a stomach problem which was not identified; he takes Effexor for depression. He said that he took the pain medications Doloxene and Codeine five times a day. It was apparent from time to time while the plaintiff was giving evidence that the ingestion of this medication did cause some slurring of his words and appeared to slightly affect his mental acuity.  
     
      
    159 It was the plaintiff’s evidence that the headaches which he experienced after the accident were different to those which he had experienced before. He said that the pre-accident headaches were definitely migrainous in nature producing nausea and what he described as a knife-like pain. They were more debilitating and occurred more frequently than after the accident. Since the accident the headaches had been more diffuse in their extent, ie they affected the whole of the occiput, were less intense and occurred about three times per week. 
     
      
    160 The plaintiff’s realisation that the headaches after the accident were different to those before appears to have occurred some years after the accident. No such differentiation was made by him in histories given to the doctors who examined in 1995, 1996 and 1997. He did, however, in the histories given to the doctors on those occasions indicate that the headaches were less intense and occurred less frequently than before. Nowhere in those medical reports could I find any history that the headaches were different in type. 
     
      
    161 No doctor has expressed an opinion as to why the plaintiff requires the regime of medication which he is currently taking. The only exception relates to his anti-depressant medication. There are reports, which refer to the plaintiff’s need to take antidepressants such as Effexor. Dr Wright has indicated the background to that prescription. Unfortunately Dr Wright was given a quite incorrect history of the plaintiff’s pre-accident health, both as to headaches and as to problems with anxiety. Accordingly, his attribution of the need for anti-depressants to the accident has to be qualified. 
     
      
    162 It is also noteworthy in the reports of Dr Wright that contrary to his advice, the plaintiff continued to take nine 25 mg capsules of Zanax on a daily basis. Zanax is a medication which assists in the treatment of anxiety. Dr Wright was understandably concerned that taking that quantity of Zanax would produce memory problems and could produce an hypnotic effect on the plaintiff. 
     
      
    163 The plaintiff gave evidence about how difficult it was to find an appropriate GP, who would prescribe the medication which he needed, after the move to Melbourne in July 2004. It seems that the plaintiff sought treatment from a number of general practitioners who by implication appear to have refused to prescribe the medication which the plaintiff was seeking. I am of the opinion that to a large extent the plaintiff is self-medicating in relation to his headaches and that he is seeking treatment only from doctors who are prepared to prescribe the medication which he asks for. 
     
      
    164 There was insufficient evidence in the plaintiff’s case to persuade me that the headaches, of which the plaintiff currently complains, and in relation to which he takes massive quantities of Doloxene and Codeine are different to those from which he was suffering before the accident. It follows that I am not prepared to find a causal connection between his headaches and the accident. I do not propose to take those headaches into account in my assessment of general damages. 
     
      
    165 It is asserted on behalf of the plaintiff that as a result of his brain injury his personality has changed. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that he was a more outgoing, jovial person before the accident. It was his wife’s evidence that he was not as quick witted as before, and that he had entirely lost his sense of humour. She described him as being quieter, very withdrawn and not speaking unless spoken to. She had observed that it was difficult for him to initiate conversation. 
     
      
    166 I certainly found the plaintiff to be somewhat dour in presentation and there was never any suggestion of levity or humour in anything that he said. That appears to contrast with his presentation in the promotional video of 1985 (exhibit F), which is the only reasonably objective evidence which I have for his pre-accident personality. 
     
      
    167 I accept the assessment of the plaintiff’s wife on this issue and I find that the plaintiff has suffered a significant personality change as a result of the accident and as described by his wife: 
     
      
       
        
        “He is not as quick witted as before with the comebacks, and his sense of humour, which was the very thing that I loved about him, has totally in my opinion has totally gone. He is a lot quieter, very withdrawn, doesn’t speak unless spoken to, finds it very hard to initiate conversation unless I make them and there is no small talk with him, and it is just very quiet, very different.” 
        
       
      
    168 Relying upon a series of reports from Dr Roberts, the Council submitted that the plaintiff not only did not suffer from memory problems or cognitive defects as a result of his brain injury, but that he was deliberately feigning such deficits when he underwent psychological testing by Dr Roberts, Mr Blows and Dr Golus. The opinion of Dr Roberts on this issue was significantly weakened when it emerged that she had wrongly calculated some of her test results, particularly in relation to those tests which were designed to detect persons who were deliberately attempting to falsify psychological test results. Her modified opinion became: 
     
      
       
        
        “In conclusion, the main grounds for exaggeration rest on the fluctuations in test scores. As I indicated in giving my evidence factors also likely to be involved in explaining the fluctuations in test scores are emotional problems and possible medication use but an element of exaggeration is not ruled out.” 
        
       
      
    169 I formed the opinion that the plaintiff was quite prepared to tailor his evidence to suit his case on occasions. His evidence as to the effect of alcohol upon him and as to his recollection immediately before the accident is an example of this. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the plaintiff was deliberately exaggerating his disability when he underwent psychological testing. 
     
      
    170 The point made by Dr Roberts as to fluctuations in scores is a good one. Her schedule of comparative test results was very useful. Of its nature traumatic brain damage does not deteriorate. It can improve. Accordingly one needs to look for an explanation where there are significant variations in scores achieved as a result of psychological testing. In this case the explanation is readily available in the plaintiff’s emotional problems and his ingestion of powerful medication. In addition, if he was deliberately exaggerating it is difficult to explain why some of his highest scores were achieved when he last saw Dr Roberts. 
     
      
    171 I am of the opinion that the plaintiff does have genuine memory problems, but I have had difficulty in assessing their extent. The problem arises not only from the fluctuations in tests results, but from the plaintiff’s evidence that he can read a book and recollect its contents and that he can remember some things and not others. It is usual when dealing with memory loss as a result of brain damage for the deficit to be consistent and more clear-cut. Both Professor Jones, a rehabilitation specialist, and Dr Somerville, a neurologist, conducted short form memory tests of the plaintiff in 1998 and neither reported any memory deficit. Quite obviously those tests are not as extensive as the psychological tests as to memory, but they are designed to reveal gross memory dysfunction if it existed. 
     
      
    172 I have concluded that the plaintiff does suffer genuine memory problems as a result of his brain injury, but that they are not as extensive as asserted by Mr Blows or by Dr Golus and that they do not have the debilitating effect suggested by Dr Buckley. It is not without significance that the high quantities of Zanax, to which Dr Wright referred, were being consumed by the plaintiff at the time when he attended Dr Roberts and Dr Golus in 1999 and underwent his psychological testing. 
     
      
    173 As a result of my observation of the plaintiff over a considerable period of time in the witness box, and as a result of my perusal of parts of his book, I am also of the opinion that his rigid mode of thinking, perseveration and obsessional traits are part of the personality change brought about by his brain damage. His long and discursive answers to many questions in which the plaintiff appeared to lose the thread of his response, I also attribute to his brain damage. This is indicative of the reduction in organisational skills, which the psychological tests revealed. 
     
      
    174 One of the more poignant features of the plaintiff’s brain injury is that he has retained most, if not all, of his pre-accident intelligence. He is therefore able to appreciate what he has lost. This, it seems to me, accounts for much of his anxiety, frustration and shortness of temper. 
     
      
    175 Taking those matters into account, I assess the plaintiff’s general damages at $175,000. I attribute half of those general damages to the past. Interest on general damages to the date of trial is $19,250. 
     
      
       
      Past economic loss 
      
    176 This case highlights the two considerations which have to be taken into account when calculating damages for economic loss: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary to identify both what capacity has been lost and what economic consequences will probably flow from that loss. Only then will it be possible to assess what sum will put the plaintiff in the same position as he or she would have been in if the injury had not been sustained.” ( 
        Husher v Husher 
         (1999) 197 CLR 138 at [7]). 
        
       
      
    177 It is clear that as a result of the accident the plaintiff lost the ability to work as a lead guitarist in the music industry. This would reduce, if not entirely eliminate, his ability to play as a guitarist in a working band.  
     
      
    178 The plaintiff appears to have lost, at least in part, some creative ability. I draw that inference from the fact that he has not produced any new songs or any music of any significance between the date of the accident and the present time. That was of the opinion of Dr Milton. One does not need to lose much of one’s intellectual ability for that creative spark to be seriously compromised. Nevertheless, he has obviously retained some creative ability or he would not have been able to hold down the job with “Next Generation Entertainment” for sixteen months. 
     
      
    179 The changes to the plaintiff’s personality, to which I referred in my analysis under general damages, has also reduced his capacity for employment. In the Furzer Crestani report upon which the plaintiff relies one of the two bases for calculating the plaintiff’s entitlement to economic loss is that uninjured he would have been able to successfully become part of the advertising industry and earn the same sort of money as he was earning with “Next Generation Entertainment” on a consistent basis. 
     
      
    180 I accept that submission. The plaintiff’s current somewhat humourless demeanour, coupled with his rigidity of thought and obsessional traits, would make him unsuitable for that industry. The reduction in his creativity and memory problems would make it less likely that he would be successful in such an industry. As indicated, the job which the plaintiff was actually able to perform for sixteen months was particularly suited to his limitations and it is unlikely that there would be other similar jobs available to him. This is particularly so if the plaintiff had to compete with persons of similar skill and talent with more ebullient personalities. 
     
      
    181 That is not to say that the plaintiff is unemployable. His responses when giving evidence and the high intellectual ability displayed in his book, persuade me that the plaintiff could work in a clerical position. This is particularly so given his high level of computer skills and the fact that such work does not require team work or significant co-operation within a group. As the CRS report made clear, the plaintiff would not like performing such work, either before or after his accident, but I am of the opinion that it remains within his capacity. I do not regard the plaintiff as totally unemployable.  
     
      
    182 I make that finding notwithstanding the evidence of Dr Buckley (T.495). In my opinion Dr Buckley’s assessment of the plaintiff’s intellectual ability was unduly pessimistic and he did not adequately appreciate the nature of the work which the plaintiff had been able to perform at “Next Generation Entertainment”. Dr Buckley did not fully appreciate the high level of computer skills which the plaintiff possessed. 
     
      
    183 In very general terms the measure of what the plaintiff has lost is the difference between what he would earn in a clerical job and what he would have earned in the advertising industry as calculated by Messrs Furzer Crestani. In attachments A1 to A4 to the Furzer Crestani report the wage rates for a number of clerical jobs are set out.  
     
      
    184 The more difficult question is to work out to what extent the plaintiff would have made use of his undoubted abilities had he not been injured.  
     
      
    185 “Australian Crawl” broke up in February 1986. In the nine years which elapsed between that date and the date of the accident, the plaintiff only worked on a reasonably successful basis for approximately two years while he was in Singapore in 1989-1990. There is even some doubt about the level of success enjoyed during that period, given the lack of documents. His work in Jakarta in 1994 could not be regarded as successful.  
     
      
    186 There were no signs at the time of the accident that the plaintiff was going to settle down and look for steady employment outside the music industry. On the contrary, in the five months that he was in Sydney before the accident he was trying to recreate another successful band. Since the break-up of “Australian Crawl” the plaintiff had been unsuccessful in finding any remunerative work in Australia. It is not clear whether and to what extent that situation would have changed if the plaintiff had not been injured. 
     
      
    187 The other complication in trying to work out what the plaintiff would have earned had he not been injured, is his state of health at the time when he was injured. The plaintiff’s evidence was that his headaches at that time would only respond to Pethidine. Although I have found that the plaintiff was not at the time addicted to Pethidine, he was certainly very close to it. When he was affected by a migraine headache, he was unable to work. Those headaches were occurring on a frequent basis per week. Rehearsing after hours with David Peach and other band members is quite different from trying to hold down a conventional job with regular hours of employment. 
     
      
    188 I am not persuaded that the plaintiff would have been capable of performing work in the advertising industry on a regular basis unless and until his headache and neck problems were properly treated. It is clear from the medical evidence for the period December 1991 – July 1995 that virtually no success had been achieved in either identifying the source of the plaintiff’s headaches and neck problems or in treating them. There was no indication at the time of the accident that a successful resolution of those problems was likely to occur in the future. 
     
      
    189 On the other hand, after the accident the plaintiff was able to work on a fulltime basis in the advertising industry for sixteen months despite the presence of the headaches for which he is currently taking medication. It is true that the plaintiff’s headaches following the accident do not appear to be as severe as they were before. In view of my finding that the headaches both before and after the accident have the same source, I am of the opinion that there was at least a reasonable prospect of the plaintiff’s headaches resolving sufficiently between July 1995 and the present time to enable him to have worked fulltime in the advertising industry.  
     
      
    190 In order to take those two matters into account, I propose to reduce by 50% the plaintiff’s claim for past economic loss.  
     
      
    191 It follows from the above analysis that I reject entirely the suggestion that the plaintiff would have been successful in starting up a new band and replicating anything like the success of “Australian Crawl” had he not been injured. There is not, in my opinion, sufficient evidence to justify such a claim being allowed even on a loss of opportunity basis. 
     
      
    192 The Furzer Crestani report provides calculations which indicate the plaintiff’s loss of earnings in the advertising industry over the period since the accident. There were no calculations other than the general wage rates in attachments A1 – A4 to indicate what the plaintiff might have earned in the sort of clerical position which I believe he would have had the capacity to fill. Quite clearly such a clerical position would be paid at a lower level than the job identified in scenario two of the Furzer Crestani report. Although I have no precise figures, using the approach in State of New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 it seems to me that a difference of $500 net per week over the period would be appropriate to represent the plaintiff’s reduction in earning capacity brought about by the accident. 
     
      
    193 If one then reduced that by fifty percent to have regard to the plaintiff’s poor employment record and the effect of the plaintiff’s pre-accident headaches and neck pain, and deducted half of the plaintiff’s actual earnings from “Next Generation Entertainment” the amount which I award for past economic loss is $110,375. 
     
      
    194 Since that loss was suffered over the whole of the period, I propose to use an interest rate of 4.5% per annum to have regard to the prevailing interest rates between 1995 and the present. Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to interest on past economic loss of $53,791. 
     
      
       
      Future loss of earning capacity 
      
    195 On behalf of the plaintiff it was submitted that by the date of trial, the plaintiff uninjured would have realised that he was unlikely to replicate the success of “Australian Crawl” in the music industry and would have settled into a more regular employment which ought be calculated either by reference to earnings in the advertising industry or by reference to the average weekly earnings of males in New South Wales. Because of the plaintiff’s pre-accident health problems, it was submitted that an additional 10% should be added to the amount to be deducted for vicissitudes, ie 25%. This deduction should be applied to either scenario one or scenario two in the Furzer Crestani report. 
     
      
    196 For the Council it was submitted that the best indication of what the plaintiff was currently able to earn was what he had actually earned with “Next Generation Entertainment”. When one combined that with his pre-accident health difficulties and difficulties in obtaining and holding employment, the plaintiff’s claim for future economic loss was modest and would be adequately dealt with by the award of a financial cushion. The figure of $100,000 for both past and future was submitted. 
     
      
    197 I propose to follow the same line of reasoning which I did in relation to the past with this exception. I am prepared to accept that by date of trial, had the plaintiff not been injured, he would have sought and obtained more steady employment probably in the advertising industry. I agree with the submission, put on behalf of the plaintiff that the most appropriate way of dealing with the plaintiff’s pre-injury health problems is to apply an increased figure for vicissitudes. I propose to apply a discount of 30% to have regard to those matters. In relation to the amount for future loss of earning capacity, it seems to me that the $500 net per week differential which I assessed for the past, is equally valid for the future for the same reasons. Using that approach the plaintiff’s damages for future loss of earning capacity are $232,750. 
     
      
    198 Using the Furzer Crestani approach to the calculation of superannuation losses, both past and future, the plaintiff’s loss of superannuation is $52,822. 
     
      
       
      Out-of-pocket expenses 
      
    199 No amount for past out-of-pocket expenses was claimed on behalf of the plaintiff. 
     
      
    200 In relation to future out-of-pocket expenses it was agreed between the parties that the plaintiff’s life expectancy was 36 years. Accordingly, the relevant 3% multiplier was 1156. The regime claimed on behalf of the plaintiff was calculated by reference to the opinions of Dr Buckley and Dr Murray Wright in respect of psychiatric treatment and the recommendations by Dr Buckley for specialist and general practitioner consultations. The claim for medication costs was made by reference to that medication which the plaintiff specified he was currently using. The total claim was $95,800. 
     
      
    201 It was conceded, on behalf of the plaintiff, that some offset would have to be made to have regard to the medication costs being incurred by the plaintiff at the time of the accident. In my assessment of general damages I found that the plaintiff’s headaches following the accident were not related to it. It follows that the plaintiff is not entitled to the cost of medication which he is taking for those headaches. Applying that finding and that concession on behalf of the plaintiff, I award the plaintiff $32,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses. 
     
      
       
      Past domestic assistance 
      
    202 The case put on behalf of the plaintiff was that he was entitled to Griffiths v Kerkemeyer damages for past assistance provided by his wife for 14 hours per week at a rate of $18 per hour. The plaintiff relied upon the evidence of his wife that after the accident she did all of the housework, the banking and that she did most of the cooking. It was also necessary for her to put up signs in the house such as “turn off the stove”, “turn off the lights”. 
     
      
    203 Reliance was placed on the evidence of Dr Buckley, a rehabilitation expert. Dr Buckley’s evidence on this subject was set out in his report of 3 May 1999, which he confirmed in his later report of 30 September 2002. In the report Dr Buckley said that because of the plaintiff’s hemiparesis, he would require handyman assistance for minor repair jobs, gardening and lawn mowing at the rate of 3 hours per week. He was of the opinion that because of the plaintiff’s hemiparesis he would require 5 hours per week of housekeeping assistance. 
     
      
    204 Towards the end of his evidence (T.532), Dr Buckley significantly altered the basis of that assessment: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In relation to some of the assistance you have recommended, that is the handyman assistance and perhaps to a lesser extent the domestic assistance. I gather the impression you thought he was significantly disabled on the right side you spoke about the right-sided hemiparesis? 
         
        A. Yes. And that was really the issue I wrote in my report but I now believe that it is his cognitive issues really that make it difficult for him to complete those tasks.” 
        
       
      
    205 Although that answer was not further elaborated on, I infer from Dr Buckley’s earlier evidence that what he was referring to was a problem with the plaintiff’s organisational skills and the need for him to be prompted to do various things.  
     
      
    206 On behalf of the Council it was submitted that the only time that the plaintiff required assistance was for about 12 months following his discharge from the Royal Rehabilitation Centre and that an undifferentiated sum of $20,000 would be sufficient to meet that claim. The Council submitted that physically there was nothing to prevent the plaintiff performing housework or performing handyman duties, provided he did not have to climb a ladder where his balance problems might come into play. It was also pointed out that the plaintiff and his family since the accident had been living in rented accommodation where most handyman duties would be performed by the landlord. The Council relied upon the assessment of Professor Jones in 1998 that the plaintiff did not require such assistance. Reference was made to the evidence that the plaintiff carried out repairs on the family car when required. 
     
      
    207 I accept that following the accident the plaintiff’s wife did the housework, did most of the cooking and did the household shopping. That does not mean that the plaintiff himself was not able to perform these tasks. There was no need for him to do so since they were being dealt with by his wife. 
     
      
    208 It was apparent from his wife’s evidence that the plaintiff was able to do housework, but simply chose not to because he was not interested in it. He did on occasion perform housework. The plaintiff was able to cook for himself and did so on occasions. The problem was that he was untidy and would not clean up afterwards (T.43.23). 
     
      
    209 In relation to shopping, the plaintiff does not seem to have been interested in shopping for groceries and household items. He did, however, do his own shopping particularly when acquiring equipment for his recording studio and for his computer and when purchasing medication (T.99-100). 
     
      
    210 The plaintiff’s wife resumed employment in 1998/1999 and has continued in employment since that date. While she was at work the plaintiff used work in his recording studio at home or otherwise engage in his own activities. The care of Lizzie was shared between the plaintiff and his wife depending on which of them was at home at the time. 
     
      
    211 The plaintiff’s wife gave evidence of an occasion in 1997 when she and Lizzie went to Singapore to visit her mother and the plaintiff was left to look after himself. She described the state of the house as being filthy when she returned from that holiday. That suggests to me not that the plaintiff was unable to carry out housework but that he was either not interested in doing so or needed to be prompted to do so. That latter consideration seems to be what Dr Buckley had in mind [204]. 
     
      
    212 The concession by the Council of there being a significant need for assistance following the plaintiff’s discharge from the rehabilitation centre is reasonable and the allowance of $20,000 would seem to be appropriate. The difficulty is to calculate whether and to what extent the plaintiff has required assistance from his wife from then on, ie from late 1996 onwards. 
     
      
    213 The plaintiff’s evidence on this subject was that his wife looked after the domestic and the financial affairs of the family. As indicated, that was not entirely correct in that the plaintiff uses the money he receives from royalties for his own purposes and did likewise in relation to his earnings from “Next Generation Entertainment”. 
     
      
    214 His response to the proposition that his wife was likely to leave him following the trial was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You know I think you have confirmed, that your wife has said that she intends to separate from you after the case is finished. How do you think you are going to cope on your own if that happens, Mr Binks? 
         
        A. I started freaking out about that this morning. She is going back today and I never thought about this before. I am so arrogant I always thought that I could look after myself, but you don’t notice all the little things that your wives or girlfriends do for you until they are not there, and now that she’s going, I don’t know how. I might be OK, I’m sure, I am a very resourceful person. I am sure I will work out a strategy by which I can manage. The other thing is that, the most important thing is that I still love her and I don’t want her to go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I understand. Are you able to tell his Honour, even though you have just started thinking about it, what particular difficulties you might have if she is not there to help you? 
         
        A. Sharon does everything for me. It drives me nuts because I am thinking why are you doing this, I can do it myself, and it is seeping over the last few days how do I know I can do it for myself? I haven’t had to since the accident because Sharon has always been there. I forget my watch and she reminds and it annoys me, of course, I remember my watch, but I have lost my glasses last night. I expect to be losing a lot of things without Sharon because she looks after me. She reminds me of things that I assume I would remember but now I have very serious doubts. I think I’m going to be very lost without Sharon and I’m going to need help, and that’s very difficult for me to say because I have never needed help in my life. I have been through some very extraordinary experiences some of them not very nice where I have had to fight my way out of very dangerous situations, so I thought myself very capable. But being able to fight yourself out of a thing and taking care of yourself on a daily basis at two very different things. I am sure I could still fight my way out of almost any fight, but I hate fights to begin with and I don’t want them in my life. I just want my wife and daughter.” (T.247-248) 
        
       
      
    215 I do not accept the original opinion of Dr Buckley that the plaintiff’s physical disabilities prevent him in any way from looking after himself, performing housework etc. I am, however, concerned about problems with his organisational ability, his need to be prompted to do things or reminded to do things and what appears to be a lack of interest in looking after household matters, such as was demonstrated when his wife was on a holiday in Singapore during 1997. The assistance which the plaintiff’s wife has been providing in the past has in reality been of an organisational kind in running the household and prompting the plaintiff when appropriate. Doing the best I can on the limited evidence available, I am of the opinion that this assistance of a prompting kind has amounted to about 5 hours per week, ie $90 per week. 
     
      
    216 In accordance with that reasoning, I calculate the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for past assistance to be $20,000 for the first year following his discharge from the rehabilitation centre and thereafter $45,630. I calculate interest on those damages at 4.5% per annum to be $31,749. 
     
      
       
      Future assistance 
      
    217 The same reasoning applies to the claim for future assistance. If, as seems likely, the plaintiff will have to live on his own for the future, he will be able to adequately look after himself provided he receives some assistance in organising himself and by way of prompting. It was agreed between the parties that an appropriate hourly rate to allow for future assistance would be $25. It seems to me that one hour of such assistance per week day, ie 5 hours per week, would satisfy the need which has been created in the plaintiff in this regard. That would give to the plaintiff damages for future assistance of $144,500.  
     
      
       
      Financial management 
      
    218 It was Dr Buckley’s opinion that the plaintiff’s deficits of higher cognitive function were such that he required assistance in the management of his financial affairs but that his deficits were not sufficiently serious as to require the intervention of the Protective Commissioner. The evidence of Dr Buckley was the only direct evidence on this issue. 
     
      
    219 Before his accident the plaintiff had not been a good manager of money, which he freely admitted. There was evidence in the trial that although the plaintiff’s wife looked after family finances in the sense that she co-ordinated the spending of her own earnings and the plaintiff’s pension, he managed the monies he received by way of royalties and had managed the monies he received from “Next Generation Entertainment”. 
     
      
    220 There was no direct evidence that the plaintiff’s ability to manage money had been reduced by the accident. I have found, however, that the plaintiff’s organisational abilities have been adversely affected and that he will require assistance in that regard and also by way of prompting and reminder insofar as the management of his home is concerned. It seems to me consistent with those findings that the plaintiff will also require some assistance in managing the verdict monies from this judgment. I anticipate that such assistance will involve an annual consultation with a financial adviser for at least the next 10 years. I propose to allow $1,000 per annum for the cost of that consultation and award damages of $9,000 under that heading. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion as to damages 
      
    221 My assessment of the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages is as follows:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 30 August 2004, the appellants BP and SW appeared before Freeman DCJ on an indictment containing four counts, each relating to events that took place at Kempsey on 5 November 2003. Each count was to the effect that the person or persons charged did have sexual intercourse with LD without her consent knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in the company of another person. The counts related to two incidents of alleged sexual activity: the third and fourth counts related to the first-occurring incident, which occurred on a grassed area near an oval at Kempsey; and the first and second counts related to the second-occurring incident, which occurred behind a nearby tree. 
     
      
    2 The first count charged both BP and SW, and was based on an allegation of digital penetration. The second count also charged both BP and SW, and was based on an allegation of penile/vaginal intercourse. The third count charged BP alone, and was based on an allegation of digital penetration. The fourth count charged SW alone, and was based on an allegation of digital penetration.  
     
      
    3 The appellants pleaded not guilty to all counts, and a trial proceeded before a jury. 
     
      
    4 On 3 September 2004, the jury returned the following verdicts: on the first count, both not guilty; on the second count, BP guilty of sexual intercourse without consent simpliciter, SW not guilty; third count, guilty; and fourth count, guilty.  
     
      
    5 Subsequently the following sentences were imposed. As regards BP, on the count involving digital penetration, the trial judge deferred passing sentence upon him entering into a three year bond, with various conditions; and on the count involving penile penetration, the trial judge sentenced him to 3 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 months. As regards SW, the trial judge sentenced him to 2 years’ imprisonment, suspended upon his entry into a bond.  
     
      
    6 Both BP and SW have appealed from their convictions, on grounds relating to the issue of doli incapax, that is, on the issue whether each of them, being under the age of 14, had sufficient understanding of what he was doing to be criminally responsible for it.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE 
      
    7 BP and SW are two Aboriginal boys, aged respectively 12 and 11 years at the time of the relevant events. BP had been born on 12 March 1991, and SW had been born on 25 May 1992.  
     
      
    8 Evidence for the Crown was given by the complainant LD, who was 16 years old at the time of the events, by her cousin DS, who was then 11 years old, by her second cousin DD, who was then 14 years old, by the complainant’s aunt and by a medical practitioner and police officers. 
     
      
    9 LD’s evidence was to the effect that she and DS were walking across Verge Street Oval in Kempsey when BP called out to her. BP was with SW and DD. She said BP ran up to her, and among other things, asked her for cigarettes; and that he then walked her to a patch of grass, tripped her so that she fell, and pulled her pants and underpants down to her ankles. He then put his fingers in her vagina as she lay screaming and crying. He called SW over, and BP told SW to “put your hand over her mouth so she doesn’t scream”. SW did this, and BP laughed and kept moving his fingers. SW then told BP to move his hand, which he did, and then SW put his fingers in LD’s vagina. LD moved on to her stomach, and as she tried to get up, SW, whilst on his knees, put his penis “in my arse with both our clothes on”. He laughed and she cried.  
     
      
    10 LD’s evidence was that she then got up and pulled her pants up, and after this BP put his arm around her and took her behind a big tree 10 or 20 steps away. BP continued to laugh and LD asked him to let her go. Behind the tree, BP pushed LD to the ground and pulled her pants down to her ankles. BP pulled his pants down and inserted his penis in her vagina and went up and down. LD gave evidence of him also inserting his fingers into her vagina, but in cross-examination she said this only occurred on the grass (this presumably explaining the not guilty verdict on the first count). LD screamed and tried to kick him off, and hit him once. She told him to move or get off numerous times. He asked her not to tell anyone. She said “I’m going to tell the police on you”, and he said “Don’t do that”; and he continued to do what he was doing. 
     
      
    11 LD’s evidence was that SW watched these events from the other side of the tree. BP threatened to bash him and threw a stick at him. SW ran around the tree and continued to watch. When BP got up, LD went with DS to a phone box and called DS’s mother (LD’s aunt) and told her “[B] and [S] raped me”. The aunt then came and took LD to the police. 
     
      
    12 DS gave evidence generally consistent with LD’s evidence, although he was not in a position to see what happened behind the tree. LD’s aunt gave evidence that she received a phone call from LD at about 2pm on 5 November 2003, in which LD said she had been raped by both BP and SW, and she said that LD was crying and upset. 
     
      
    13 DD’s evidence concerning the incident on the grassed area was not consistent with LD’s evidence, particularly in that he gave no evidence that LD cried or screamed. He also said that when SW put his hands in LD’s underpants, he told SW not to do this and he stopped. DD’s evidence was that LD went with BP behind the tree without being held by BP and walked there calmly. He did not hear LD cry or scream from behind the tree, although he did say that afterwards she was upset. 
     
      
    14 A medical practitioner Dr. Caine gave evidence of an examination of LD on 5 November 2003, at which he found superficial scratches on her legs and left buttock, and found the genital area normal and consistent with either consensual or non-consensual digital and penile penetration.  
     
      
    15 Detective Leading Senior Constable Ismay gave evidence that he saw LD and her aunt at Kempsey Police Station at about 2.30 pm on 5 November 2003, and that LD appeared upset, and was crying and red in the face. At 6pm he did an electronic interview with BP, which became an exhibit in the case: in that interview, BP admitted he had sexual intercourse with LD, but said it was consensual. 
     
      
    16 Detective Senior Constable Rutledge gave evidence of the arrest of SW. He said he then saw SW and his elder sister at Kempsey Police Station, and after an ALS solicitor had spoken to them, he formally warned SW and asked if he wanted to talk to police about the matter. SW said “No because I didn’t do nothing”. The police officer then said “Do you know that it is wrong to assault or hurt or touch anyone if you don’t want them to [sic]?”, to which SW nodded his head and said “yes”.  
     
      
    17 Two statements were tendered by the Crown on the issue of doli incapax. As against SW, there was the statement of Ms. Jeannette Liva, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        I completed a Bachelor of Arts, with a double major In Psychology in 1999 at the University of Western Sydney. I completed a Diploma of Forensic Psychology at the University of Western Sydney in 2000. I am currently registered as an intern psychologist.  
         
         
        I interviewed [SW] on the 17th of June 2003. This interview was with [SW] by himself. During this interview I discussed with [SW] his sexualized behavior. [SW] initially demonstrated minimal understanding of consent and boundary issues relating to sexual behavior. I talked to [SW] about inappropriate sexual behaviors. He appeared to understand and was able to verbalize what was right and wrong in relation to sexual behaviors. It is my opinion that [SW] understood the difference between appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior.  
        
       
      
    18 As against BP, there was a statement of Ms. Lynette Dockrill, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        I am the assistant principal of the West Kempsey Primary School in Marsh Street, West Kempsey. I have been employed by the New South Wales Department of Education for a period of 28 years, and have been teaching at West Kempsey Primary School for a period of five years. 
         
         
        During 2000, I met a student by the name of [BP]. [BP] was at the time in Year 5. I also had him in my class whilst in Year 8. In 2001 [BP] was placed in the Achievement Class as he had demonstrated academic potential. I believe that [BP] was quite capable and able to complete set tasks and follow directions. I maintained an excellent rapport with [BP] whilst he was under my care and control in the classroom. 
         
         
        I was however aware that [BP] had social problems when mixing with other students and accepting authority from anyone. I was also aware that he had been placed on the Itinerant Support Teacher for Behaviour, Miss Janice PRINCE. Her role was to counsel and support [BP] with his social needs whilst at school, and in particular in the playground. I witnessed a number of incidents involving [BP] having altercations with other students, and being both verbally and physically violent towards them. 
         
         
        On many occasions as his class teacher in 2001, I spoke to [BP] about the inappropriateness of his behaviour and what he could do to remedy the problems. I could say that it was a daily occurrence that I would speak to [BP] about his behaviour, and on these many occasions I told [BP] that what he was doing was wrong, and unacceptable in our society. I frequently said to him, “You can’t go around hitting and hurting people.” On these occasions when I was counselling him over his behaviour, [BP] appeared to accept what I was telling him as he would quiten (sic) down and drop his head. He appeared remorseful for his actions when I explained to him that what he was doing was wrong. 
         
         
        I was present with the principal at the time, David WILLARD, Ron BROWN (Deputy Principal), Bertrick CLOSE (Aboriginal Education Assistant), Janice PRINCE, [BP], and his parents then (sic) a Resolution Meeting was held at the school on the 12th of February, 2001. 
         
         
        [BP] was counselled during the meeting by Mr. WILLARD, in the presence of his parents, as to his inappropriate behaviour including physical attacks on students and teachers, intimidation, defiance, and swearing. I recall that [BP] acknowledged that he had failed to comply with behavioural standards, by answering “Yes” in understanding that he had done wrong. 
        
       
      
    19 No evidence was given either by or on behalf of SW or BP.  
     
      
       
      DIRECTION TO JURY 
      
    20 In directing the jury as to the elements of the first count, the trial judge said this about the impact of doli incapax in relation to BP: 
     
      
       
        
        The fourth essential element, or fifth I suppose if one counts the circumstance of aggravation, is the Crown has to prove, because of the age of these two young persons, the Crown has to prove that each of them knew that what they were doing was wrong, very wrong. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the child accused did the act charged and that when doing that act he knew it was a wrong act, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or childish mischief, and a guilty knowledge that he was doing wrong must be proved by the evidence and cannot be presumed from the mere commission of the act. You have to determine, from a review of the evidence, whether it is satisfactorily proved, that is beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time [BP] did that which he is accused of doing, put his finger or fingers into [LD] behind the tree, if you find that was done, that he had a guilty knowledge that he was committing a crime. You do not have to find that he knew exactly which section of the Crimes Act he was breaching but he had to know that it was a serious act, that he was committing a crime and not being just naughty and mischievous or the like.  
         
         
        Now the Crown relies, for that purpose, upon the act itself and upon the evidence which was led this morning, including in particular the statement of Ms Dockrill when she - I will not go through the whole statement but the burden of the Crown argument is that for some time prior to this during 2000 and 2001 Ms Dockrill had a deal to do with [BP], that she went through with him what was wrong and what was acceptable in our society and so on, you cannot go around hitting and hurting people, and so on. So the Crown says you would accept beyond reasonable doubt that at the time at which he put his fingers into [LD] behind the tree, if you accept that that was done beyond reasonable doubt, then he did know that that was a very seriously wrong thing to do and not just being mischievous or naughty. 
        
       
      
    21 He then gave directions concerning SW’s alleged role as an aider and abetter in relation to that count, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        And the Crown has to prove also that at the time of offering this support, being an aider and abetter to this action, that [SW] knew, as I have just defined for you, that what was going on, what he was taking part in, was not mischief or naughtiness, it was a serious wrong. He had to know that it was a crime that was going on, and in relation to that the Crown relies upon the evidence of Ms Liva who, you will recall, in very short form said that she was a psychologist, that she had occasion to interview [SW] 17 June 2003, that is some months before this took place, and she recounts that he appeared to understand and was able to verbalise what was right and wrong in relation to sexual behaviours.  
         
         
        So if you accept her evidence, it is not subject to any challenge, but nonetheless it is the evidence of an expert, which you are not obliged to accept, experts are people who, unlike the rest of us, are entitled to come along because of their experience and training and offer opinions. The rest of us, as lay persons, are only allowed to come and give evidence of what we heard or saw or experienced. Whereas experts, because of their training and experience, can come and give opinions to assist juries. Juries do not have to accept what they say, it depends whether it accords with your own commonsense and so on, but that is her expert opinion, that he knew the difference between right and wrong sexual behaviour as at June 2003. So that is the first count.  
        
       
      
    22 The trial judge then dealt with the second count, and said this: 
     
      
       
        
        So you can be satisfied it appears to be conceded that there was an act of sexual intercourse. Of course there is still dispute as to whether it was without  
        consent, 
         whether [BP] knew that there was an absence of consent and the Crown still has to establish beyond reasonable doubt that [BP] knew that (a) there was no consent and (b) that what he was doing was a serious wrong and not just mucking around, if you like, to use an expression which I suppose was current when I was a kid, I do not know whether it still is, but mischief or simple naughtiness. 
         
         
        Again the Crown charges that on the basis of [BP] doing the act, [SW] providing the support being an aider and abetter in circumstances of aggravation, that is they were in company, [SW] close enough to support [BP]. If you found that that allegation was made out in its entirety, that there was an act of sexual intercourse, with which you will have no difficulty, it was without consent that he knew that she was not consenting, that he understood that what he was doing was committing a crime, but you were not satisfied that [SW] was there in company, then again you could find, on that count, him guilty of the charge of sexual intercourse but not in the circumstances of aggravation. 
        
       
      
    23 The trial judge then dealt with the elements of the third and fourth counts, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown has to prove in relation to those things in relation to each accused of course that each knew that, had this guilty knowledge, that they were committing a crime, not doing something which was just mischievous, and relies upon the evidence that I have recounted to you already from Ms Dockrill and Ms Liva. 
        
       
       
      ISSUES ON APPEAL 
      
    24 BP has relied on two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury as to what knowledge of serious wrongdoing held by the young accused was required by the prosecution to be proved for the presumption of  
        doli incapax  
        to be rebutted, resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice requiring that the guilty verdicts of the jury be set aside with no new trial order. 
         
         
        2. The trial judge erred in his summation to the jury as to what knowledge of serious wrongdoing had been shown to be held by each accused and what degree of knowledge of that wrongdoing could be inferred from statements of Ms Janet Liva and Ms Dockrill (see submissions) resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice and requiring that the guilty verdicts of the jury be set aside with no new trial order. 
        
       
      
    25 SW also relies on two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. There has been a miscarriage of justice in that his Honour mis-directed the jury about  
        doli incapax. 
         
         
        2. There has been a miscarriage of justice in that the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and unable to be supported with regard to  
        doli incapax. 
        
       
      
    26 The issues overlap, and I will proceed by considering first the law as to doli incapax, and then the submissions for BP and SW. I will then give my decision. 
     
      
       
      LAW ON DOLI INCAPAX 
      
    27 The common law concerning the criminal responsibility of children has been modified in New South Wales by s.5 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (which provides for a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 years can be guilty of an offence), but not otherwise. Accordingly, as regards a child between 10 and 14 years, there remains a presumption that such a child is doli incapax, that is incapable of committing a crime because of lack of understanding of the difference between right and wrong, and consequential lack of mens rea. It is clear that when a child between 10 and 14 years is accused of a crime, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the child did the act charged, accompanied by the necessary mental element, but also that, when doing it, he or she knew it was seriously wrong, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief: The Queen v. M (1977) 16 SASR 589; C v. DPP [1996] 1 AC 1 at 38; R v. CRH, NSWCCA, 18/12/96; R v. ALH (2003) 6 VR 276. 
     
      
    28 The child must know that the act is seriously wrong as a matter of morality, or according to the ordinary principles of reasonable persons, not that it is a crime or contrary to law: Stapleton v. The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, The Queen v. M.  
     
      
    29 It has been said that evidence to prove the child’s guilty knowledge must not be the mere proof of doing the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong the act may be: C v. DPP at 38. This was said in CRH to represent the common law of Australia; but it was strongly disapproved by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v. ALH at [20] and [85]-[86]. However, on either view, the circumstances of the offence, such as concern to avoid detection, may be some evidence of knowledge; although, if the concern is consistent with the child thinking that the act is merely naughty, this will carry little weight.  
     
      
    30 It is not necessary to resolve this conflict in this case, because there was evidence in addition to the mere doing of the acts charged. However, I would say that, even if the view expressed in C v. DPP and CRH is correct, there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence. For example, in the present case, assuming the jury accepted LD’s evidence that she was crying and screaming and struggling and asking BP to stop, these would in my opinion be factors that could support the inference that BP knew that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being and as such was seriously wrong. That evidence, coupled with the evidence that BP asked SW to stop LD screaming, that BP continued what he was doing after LD said she would tell the police, and the statement of Ms. Dockrill, was in my opinion plainly sufficient to base a finding by the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that BP had sufficient understanding of the wrongness of his conduct.  
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    31 I will briefly summarise the submissions for each appellant. 
     
      
    32 For BP, Mr. Austin submitted that the summing up failed to give the jury any assistance on the question of how the evidence in the case bore on the issue of whether BP had the requisite understanding. In particular, the summing up did not advert to the significance of the evidence of DD suggesting little overt objection from or suffering by LD, and it left the jury with the impression that the evidence of Ms. Dockrill, on its own, was sufficient to rebut the presumption.  
     
      
    33 For SW, Mr. Button SC submitted that the trial judge did not state the relevant test clearly: he said variously that it had to be shown that SW knew what he did was wrong, was very wrong, was a serious act, was a crime, was very seriously wrong, and was a serious wrong. This was confusing to the jury. The jury could have reasoned on the basis that there are trivial crimes that could be considered not seriously wrong.  
     
      
    34 Mr. Button further submitted that, in the circumstances, the jury could not reasonably have been satisfied, to the requisite standard, that SW knew that the act constituting count 4 was seriously wrong. He was only 11 years old at the time. BP was the moving party with regard to the whole incident. SW was laughing at the time. When told what he was doing was wrong, he desisted. At the time of the incident behind the tree, SW was childishly running back and forth and peeking at them. Afterwards, he was crying with regard to a missing $10 note. Further, SW remarked that BP could be in trouble, but said nothing about possible consequences for himself. He put his hand over LD’s mouth at the request of BP. The evidence of Ms. Liva, concluding that he had some understanding of the difference between appropriate and inappropriate sexual behaviour, did not support a finding that he knew what he did was seriously wrong.  
     
      
       
      DECISIONS 
      
    35 On Mr. Button’s first submission, in my opinion there is no clearly established form of words that must be used in a direction on this question. What is important is to bring home to the jury that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, at the time of doing the act, knew it was seriously wrong, and not mere naughtiness or mischief. In this summing up, I do not think the reference to “crime” was such as to divert the jury’s attention from the essential question, which in my opinion was sufficiently indicated in the directions. In my opinion, this view is confirmed by the circumstance that no objection was taken to the summing up at the time.  
     
      
    36 As regards Mr. Austin’s submission for BP, I note that no complaint is made on appeal about the judge’s directions on facts generally. The complaint that is made is that the summing up did not relate the factual issues to the issue concerning doli incapax. In my opinion, it was not an error not to do so, and certainly not an error such as would give rise to a miscarriage of justice. The trial judge did not direct the jury that the evidence of Ms. Dockrill on its own was sufficient. Rather, he said that the Crown relied on the act itself, and on Ms. Dockrill; and in my opinion, that reference to “the act itself” was apt to direct the jury’s attention to factors such as those referred to in par.[30] above. Again, in my opinion it is of some significance that no complaint about this direction was made at the trial.  
     
      
    37 Mr. Button’s submissions for SW on the second ground of appeal raises more difficult questions. Certainly, the Crown case on the issue of doli incapax was less strong against SW than against BP.  
     
      
    38 I would comment at once that the statement to the police officer should be considered as of no weight. It was not in fact referred to in the summing up, although it had been relied on in the Crown’s address to the jury. In my opinion, it was wrong for the police officer to seek an admission as to an element which the prosecution had to prove, after SW said he did not want to talk to the police. Further, the assent to the proposition that something was “wrong”, put to SW by the police after his arrest, was in my opinion of no value in establishing that, at the time of the events, SW knew what he did was seriously wrong rather than merely naughty or mischievous.  
     
      
    39 The statement of Ms. Liva, the evidence that, at BP’s request, SW put his hand over LD’s mouth to stop her screaming, and the evidence that, during the time of his digital penetration of LD, she was crying and screaming and struggling, was evidence supporting the proposition that SW knew what he was doing was seriously wrong. In so far as SW relies on DD’s evidence, as to SW stopping when he was told what he was doing was wrong, and as to SW childishly running back and forth and peeking at what was happening behind the tree, this is not evidence that this Court must accept. The conviction of BP on count 2 suggests that the jury did not accept DD’s evidence.  
     
      
    40 The assessment of whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that SW knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong is very much a matter to be determined by a jury, rather than by this Court on appeal. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and should be set aside on that basis. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
      
    41 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal of BP dismissed. 
       
      2. Appeal of SW dismissed.

     Paonga VUNI v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    3 HOEBEN J: The applicant stood trial in the Supreme Court at Orange before Studdert J and a jury on an indictment containing two counts: 
     
      
       
      (i) Aggravated break, enter and steal on 29 January 2003 (premises occupied by Stephen and Debra Eslick. 
       
      (ii) Murder of Stephen Eslick (the deceased) on 10 March 2003. 
       
      
    4 The trial commenced on 29 November 2004 and the jury retired to consider its verdict on 8 December 2004. On 14 December 2004 the jury returned with verdicts of not guilty to the first count and not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter in relation to the second count. 
     
      
    5 On 11 March 2005 Studdert J sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    6 There was no issue at the trial that the applicant deliberately shot the deceased in the head. The applicant made that admission shortly after the incident when interviewed by the police. The applicant shot the deceased by firing a single shot from a .357 Ruger Magnum pistol. The shooting occurred shortly after 2pm on 9 March 2003 at the applicant’s unit at 158 McLachlan Street, Orange. 
     
      
    7 The background to the shooting is important. On 29 January 2003 the deceased’s home had been broken into and weapons and other possessions of his had been taken. One of the weapons taken was the Ruger pistol which the applicant used to shoot the deceased. His Honour was not able to say how it was that the applicant came into possession of that pistol before the shooting. The two most likely scenarios were that he got it from the deceased or from one of the persons who had stolen it from the deceased. 
     
      
    8 At some time after 29 January 2003 the deceased approached the applicant for assistance in recovering the weapons. The applicant was offered money by the deceased to recover the weapons and to inflict harm on those responsible for taking them. His Honour was not able to say why such an approach was made by the deceased. 
     
      
    9 Some weeks before the shooting, the applicant and the deceased were talking in Mirrool Way when the deceased produced a pistol, took a bullet from his jeans and loaded the pistol in front of the applicant. During that conversation the deceased was heard to say to the applicant “I am losing patience”. 
     
      
    10 Prior to the shooting, the applicant was aware that the deceased had arranged for persons whom the deceased believed were associated with the break in to be assaulted. On one occasion the applicant intervened to protect a Mr Roberts from such an attack. The applicant’s de facto wife was so afraid when she saw the appearance of the deceased’s car in the car park of their unit, that she left the premises and stayed away for one week. Following her return to the unit, the deceased had come looking for the applicant several times. 
     
      
    11 On the day of the shooting, the deceased came to the applicant’s unit. At that time the applicant’s partner was present, as was her daughter Kellie-Anne, with her infant daughter. An infant cousin was present as well. 
     
      
    12 The deceased came to the front door wanting to talk to the applicant. The conversation took place while the deceased stood at the front door and while the applicant remained seated on a stool beside a kitchen bench. The applicant and the deceased were arguing. The deceased said: “Where’s my stuff”. The applicant replied “What stuff? I don’t know what you are talking about”. The deceased said “You know what I’m talking about. Where’s my stuff?” to which the applicant responded “No, I don’t know what stuff you are talking about. How many times do I have to tell you not to come around here when my family’s here?” As the conversation became heated, the two women left the unit through the back door taking the children with them. 
     
      
    13 Contrary to what the applicant had told the police (ie that the deceased had a hand in his pocket) his Honour found that throughout the conversation, until the fatal shot was fired, the deceased was standing at the doorway facing into the unit. He had his left hand against the door and that hand was placed half way up the door. The other hand was resting on the top of a child’s stroller which was positioned along the front wall of the unit and outside it. It was while the deceased was standing in that position that he was shot and fell backwards away from the unit. The eyewitness, Mr Todd, observed that the deceased looked casual until he was shot and that the position of his hands did not change. No pistol was found on the deceased, although some bullets were found in the pocket of his jeans.  
     
      
    14 His Honour specifically rejected the version of events given by the applicant to the police that the deceased was shot as he was moving his hand from his pocket. His Honour also found that the applicant had fired a pistol on previous occasions, that the applicant had shot the deceased with intent to kill and that he aimed at the deceased’s head. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found that the basis of the jury’s verdict was that the applicant acted in excessive self-defence and/or defence of members of his family. In reaching that conclusion his Honour made the following specific findings: 
     
      
       
      (i) That the deceased had approached the applicant offering him money to recover the stolen weapons and to assault the men responsible; 
       
       
      (ii) In the weeks following the initial approach the deceased repeatedly came to the applicant’s home; 
       
       
      (iii) The deceased had threatened to kill the applicant if he did not do what he had been asked to do; 
       
       
      (iv) There was an incident at Mirrool Way when the deceased threatened the applicant by producing a gun and loading it in front of him; 
       
       
      (v) As at the time of the shooting, the applicant personally believed in the circumstances as he perceived them to be that it was necessary for him to do what he did to defend himself and/or his de facto wife and her daughter, but that what the applicant did was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. 
       
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    16 Against the background of those findings, His Honour made the following assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner’s response was plainly unreasonable. Indeed, I consider his response to have been extremely unreasonable. He chose deliberately to shoot the deceased intending to kill him and he gave no prior warning. Whilst I have to accept, because of the verdict of the jury, that the prisoner believed as he perceived the circumstances that it was necessary for him to do what he did, and further that he may have believed the deceased to have been armed, the position is that he shot the deceased when the deceased was holding no weapon, and when the deceased was standing at the front door with one hand resting on the door and the other resting on the child’s stroller. He deliberately took a human life and I must, and I do, regard the objective features of his crime as serious indeed.” (ROS 12-13) 
        
       
      
    17 In relation to subjective features, his Honour noted that the applicant was 50 years of age. He had been born in Tonga, had come to Australia at the age of 14 and had some schooling in Tonga and subsequently in Australia. He had been raised by his grandparents. Most of his work had comprised farming and labouring work in rural areas. His de facto relationship with Ms Parker had commenced 9 years before. 
     
      
    18 A report from a psychologist was tendered on behalf of the applicant. It referred to longstanding daily use of cannabis, to abuse the applicant had suffered as a child and that he had already served several sentences within the gaol system and ran a risk of becoming institutionalised. 
     
      
    19 The applicant had a poor criminal record. It included offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an assault upon his de facto wife in December 2000. His Honour took account of the applicant’s criminal record for the purposes of s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 but noted that in accordance with R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 the applicant’s criminal record was not to be treated as making the offence for which he was being sentenced more serious. 
     
      
    20 In relation to aggravating and mitigating features under s21A, his Honour took into account that the offence involved the use of a weapon, that the offence was not pre-planned and that the applicant had expressed remorse. Because of the applicant’s previous criminal record, his Honour could not be confident that the applicant would be unlikely to re-offend and he did not think that his prospects of rehabilitation were favourable. His Honour declined to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    21 Although a victim impact statement was before his Honour, his Honour did not take it into account for the purposes of determining what sentence should be imposed on the applicant (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76). 
     
      
    22 On behalf of the applicant, a table of 53 cases involving sentences for manslaughter was placed before his Honour. Five of those involved “excessive self-defence” and the balance related to provocation. His Honour found those cases to be generally unhelpful because of the wide variation in relevant circumstances which of necessity arose in manslaughter cases. His Honour noted that the head sentence in those cases rarely exceeded 10 years and was frequently significantly lower. 
     
      
    23 His Honour did, however, take as a reference point the matter of R v Cioban [2003] NSWCCA 304. That matter concerned a manslaughter offence involving excessive self-defence. On appeal, a head sentence of 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years was imposed. His Honour considered that the objective features of this case were significantly more serious than those in Cioban. 
     
      
    24 Although a shooting was involved in both matters, in Cioban the death occurred in a struggle after the offender was pursued by the deceased. During the pursuit, the offender had fired a warning shot which the deceased did not heed and after the deceased caught up with the offender, they struggled and fell. It was in the course of that struggle that the shot was fired. The deceased posed a serious threat of physical harm to the offender, being of bigger build and being well affected by alcohol. In Cioban the offender had not been in custody before and his subjective features were assessed as “powerful”. 
     
      
    25 Even though his Honour used Cioban as a reference point, he stressed that with the offence of manslaughter each case depended very much upon its own special facts and that his task was to impose a sentence which appropriately reflected the objective gravity of the particular offence, including the unreasonableness of the offender’s response, but which also had due regard to the subjective features of the particular offender. His Honour took into account the purposes of sentencing expressed in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    26 That was the only ground of appeal. It was submitted that his Honour fell into error by characterising the objective features of the present case as “significantly more serious than those in Cioban”. The fact that in Cioban the offender did not believe that the deceased had a weapon, had not been threatened with death by the deceased and that there was no pre-existing threat, were relied upon as indicating the objective seriousness of the offence in that case. It was sought to contrast those facts with the repeated visits by the deceased to the applicant’s home and the ongoing threats made by the deceased who was known to possess a pistol. 
     
      
    27 There are a number of difficulties with that submission. The most obvious is the level of unreasonableness involving in the response. As his Honour pointed out, the applicant’s response was “extremely unreasonable”. In the passage quoted [16] his Honour set out the basis for that conclusion. In essence what the applicant had done was to launch a pre-emptive strike against the deceased to prevent his threats ever becoming a reality. As his Honour appreciated, that was a significantly more serious circumstance that that which arose in Cioban. There the threat had become a reality and the offender was locked in what he believed to be a life and death struggle at the time of the shooting. It follows that I am not persuaded that his Honour was wrong to characterise the objective seriousness of this offence as greater than that in Cioban. 
     
      
    28 Another difficulty, which is fundamental to the submission, is that it assumes that the appropriateness of a sentence for the offence of manslaughter can in part be assessed by reference to a detailed comparison of sentences imposed in other reasonably similar cases. That might be so if the cases were in fact similar and if there were a sufficient number of them to establish a clear sentencing trend. 
     
      
    29 Unfortunately the offence of manslaughter of its nature covers a wide spectrum of factual circumstances. It is rare for there to be any real comparability in facts. The observation of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge (unreported, NSW CCA, 12 December 1995) remains valid. 
     
      
       
        
        “The crime of manslaughter comprehends all forms of punishable homicide other than murder ( 
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW) s18). For presently relevant purposes, the crime of murder is taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, causing death, was done with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. Some forms of manslaughter, such as that with which we are presently concerned, involved conduct which would amount to murder, except for the presence of some recognised mitigating circumstance. Other forms of manslaughter, sometimes referred to as “involuntary”, do not involve an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life. They may, for example, involve causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
        
       
       
        
        It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range and degree of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case ( 
        R v Dodd  
        (1991) 57 A Crim R 349,  
        R v Hill 
         (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402).” 
        
       
      
    30 More recently Spigelman CJ in R v Forbes [2005] NSW CCA 377 commented to similar effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “133 As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
        ). In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler 
         (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]). 
        
       
       
        
        134 It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within 
         any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        135 For example, where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is “diminished” can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as “child killing by a parent or carer”, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases (see  
        Hoerler 
         (supra)). This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff it is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence ( 
        R v Trevenna 
         (2003) 149 A Crim R 505). 
        
       
       
        
        136 The test established by s148 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         is whether “the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them”. Such a test must depend on the characteristics and conduct of the deceased and also the nature of the response, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, on the part of the accused. A test of such a wide-ranging character is unlikely to lead to anything in the nature of a sentencing pattern or tariff in which the decisions on one case are of any particular utility for another.” 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour was referred to five cases involving excessive self-defence. Even when this application was heard, the Court was referred to only a further five cases involving excessive self-defence. It is also noteworthy that the sentences imposed in most of those cases followed upon a plea of guilty, whereas the present matter had proceeded to verdict as a result of a trial. It seems clear that apart from the fundamental problem referred to in Blacklidge and Forbes that the statistical sample of sentences for the offence of manslaughter where excessive defence is involved, is too small to be of any real practical value. 
     
      
    32 What his Honour was required to do and in fact did was to accurately review the facts and assess the objective seriousness of the offence by reference to the particular circumstances associated with it. Those which his Honour specifically identified were that the applicant had chosen deliberately to shoot the deceased intending to kill him without any prior warning. Although the applicant may have believed the deceased to be armed, the shooting took place at a time when the deceased was holding no weapon and was standing in such a way as to not present any immediate threat. It was against that background that his Honour passed the sentence which he did. 
     
      
    33 To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). This has to be established in a context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle. Most pertinently the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge. (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 at [26] – [28]). 
     
      
    34 In the present case Studdert J had a substantial discretion in sentencing the applicant for the offence of manslaughter and it has not been shown that the sentence which he imposed fell outside the range of a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. A conclusion that the sentence fell outside the range of a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion cannot be demonstrated by a comparison with or by reference to the very few other cases in which sentences have so far been imposed for “excessive self-defence” manslaughter offences. 
     
      
    35 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentences passed on the respondent by Goldring DCJ at Sydney District Court. The respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment containing eight counts relating to separate crimes carried out on 28 November 2002 and 20 December 2003 respectively. Count 1 charged aggravated robbery (being armed with a dangerous weapon) and counts 2 and 3 being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner. These offences were committed on 28 November 2002. Count 1 has a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment. Counts 4, 5 and 6 charged robbery in company and counts 7 and 8 charged assault. These offences were committed on 20 December 2003. Robbery in company carries a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 I shall, in due course, recite the individual sentences but it can be noted that the effective sentence upon the whole indictment amounted to a non parole period of five years with a balance term of two years and six months. 
     
      
    3 Senior counsel for the respondent has confirmed the accuracy of summaries of the facts as recapitulated in the Crown written submissions and I will draw largely from them for these sketches. 
     
      
    4 Shortly before 6 am on 28 November 2002 the respondent and others came to a warehouse in Alexandria. They brought with them several vehicles including a blue Subaru sedan which had been stolen on 20 November and had been fitted with licence plates stolen from another vehicle on 25 November, a forklift and pallet jack, which had been rented for a single day by an offender other than the respondent and an Isuzu truck which had been stolen on 27 November. It might be mentioned that the truck was stolen from outside premises located about 300 metres from the respondent’s home.  
     
      
    5 A gatekeeper released security to permit the entry of a truck driven by a Mr Errington, who was there upon lawful business, as was a second driver, Mr Cassels. These drivers were approached by the offenders, one of whom was armed with a baseball bat and the other with a pistol. Face disguises were worn. Mr Errington’s arm was broken by a blow delivered with the baseball bat. Threats were made by use of the pistol. The gatekeeper and the drivers were directed to sit on the ground. 
     
      
    6 The offenders were using walkie-talkies to communicate with each other. One of them commenced to load pallets of mobile phones onto the stolen truck by means of the forklift. He was an incompetent operator and kept stalling it. The gatekeeper was drafted, at gunpoint, to operate it.  
     
      
    7 During these events, two more drivers engaged in lawful business arrived. They were directed to sit with the others and they complied as a result of threat with the pistol. 
     
      
    8 After the truck was loaded the offenders fled. It had been loaded with goods to a wholesale value of $1.2 million. 
     
      
    9 Police response was prompt. They had received information from observers about the Subaru and the truck. By 10.30 am that day they had located them and, in particular, the truck and stolen cargo were secured. Arrests, not including the respondent, were made. Search warrants were executed upon residential premises of one of those arrested and on a self storage unit, which he had leased.  
     
      
    10 In the residence there were found and seized disposable overalls; two pistols; disposable dust masks; balaclavas; police scanners; two way radios and a floor plan of the warehouse premises at which the robbery had taken place.  
     
      
    11 In the storage unit there were found and seized a loaded SKS chinese assault rifle; a shotgun; two walkie-talkies; a radio scanner; $42,250 in cash and stolen computer equipment. 
     
      
    12 A subsequent examination located the respondent’s fingerprints on the plan of the Alexandria warehouse which had been seized at the residence. 
     
      
    13 The respondent was arrested and charged on 3 January 2003 but was granted bail following an application to the Supreme Court on 6 January 2003. 
     
      
    14 It scarcely needs to be emphasized that the sentencing judge was indubitably correct when he described the foregoing, and the later offence which I shall describe, as extremely sophisticated and highly planned robberies. 
     
      
    15 On count 1 his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years with a balance term of two years and six months, and on each of counts 3 and 4 to a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months, to be served concurrently with each other and with the first twelve months of the non parole period fixed for count 1.  
     
      
    16 At about 8.30 am on 20 December 2003 staff at a Westpac Bank at Auburn were being admitted to the building by the manager. The respondent and another followed them inside. They were dressed as employees of Telstra and had on dark gloves, hard hats, overalls, gloves and white face masks. They stated that they were there to do some work for Telstra and some electrical work. However, the manager was suspicious and the intruders responded by threatening the staff with Taser guns. They directed the staff to lie on the floor. While they were there they heard the offenders apparently using radio communication devices. While the staff were on the floor, a third offender (Jaafar) came to them and bound them with cable ties. 
     
      
    17 The offenders then sought access to the bank safe and “the treasury”. The staff denied knowledge of relevant combinations necessary for opening the safe. A person who was admitted after the intruders were already in the banking chamber was abused as a liar when she made her denial – perhaps the robbers thought that later arrival would indicate authority – and she was kicked in the buttocks and later on the legs. 
     
      
    18 Eventually, under threat, a telephone call was made and some safes were able to be opened. These did not include the treasury safe. Money that was accessible was tipped into a black bag and the offenders made to leave the bank. 
     
      
    19 By this time police were in position outside the bank. Jaafar pointed a gun at police but, upon their direction, he dropped it and he was arrested. The respondent and the third man took flight on foot and successfully evaded the police cordon. In various places along the offenders’ deduced line of flight were found white shoes, a white facemask, a two way radio and, later, a firearm in a shop yard. The black bag had been abandoned at the bank and it was found to contain about $70,000 in different currencies. 
     
      
    20 Scientific procedures located a DNA profile on the shoes and dust mask which matched the DNA of the respondent. On 24 November 2004 he was arrested and charged in respect of the events at the bank. At that date he was already in custody in respect of unrelated matters. 
     
      
    21 On count 4 (robbery in company) the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of three years and a balance term of two years, and on counts 5 and 6 (robbery in company) and on counts 7 and 8 (assault) to fixed terms of imprisonment of two years to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the first two years of the non parole period specified in respect of count 4.  
     
      
    22 As I have mentioned, the respondent was in custody for three days following his arrest in respect of the warehouse robbery, from 3 to 6 January 2003. Unrelated to the present matters he commenced to serve a sentence of nine months periodic detention on 16 May 2003 for driving whilst disqualified and reckless driving. That sentence was current when the bank robbery took place and he had been on bail in respect of these offences when the warehouse robbery occurred. He was, of course, still on bail in respect of that robbery when he participated in the bank robbery. 
     
      
    23 The respondent was taken into custody on 22 March 2004 and has remained in custody since that time. The matters for which he was taken into custody then were not proceeded with by the Director of Public Prosecutions. His Honour therefore took 22 March 2004 as the start of the respondent’s custody for the robberies and, giving credit for the three days in January 2003, selected a commencement for his first sentences of 19 March 2004. 
     
      
    24 The orders which he made and the consequences were as follows: 
     
      
       
      That the sentences on counts 1, 2 and 3 commence on 19 March 2004 and the non parole period on count 1 expire on 18 March 2009; that the sentences on counts 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 commence on 19 March 2006 and the non parole period on count 4 expire on 18 march 2009; that (although his Honour did not expressly specify it) the first date of eligibility for the respondent’s parole became 18 March 2009.  
       
      
    25 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am going to make the three sentences that I propose for the offences committed on 28 October (sic) concurrent with each other and similarly the second group of offences but there will be some partial accumulation of those sentences.” 
        
       
      
    26 In fact, the effect of the orders made was that there was no accumulation. 
     
      
    27 The Crown complaint in this appeal is two-fold. First, grouping the individual offences by occasion, the sentences assessed in respect of each failed to reflect the objective gravity of the offences; second, the total effective sentence does not reflect the total criminality. 
     
      
    28 The high level of objective criminality needs no comment beyond the sketch of the conduct constituting the offences above set out. Deliberate and planned crimes like these demand a considerable element of the reflection of personal and general deterrence. Those who contemplate participation in such attacks upon the conduct of lawful business and commerce should anticipate punishment of a severity proportioned to such organized and intentional misconduct.  
     
      
    29 The Crown submissions contain a detailed analysis of the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It should be noted that, in the present instance, the principal offences are aggravated robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) thereof. Senior counsel for the respondent had stated at first instance: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, it is conceded that those three factors in each case, that is the degree of violence actually presented, the planning involved and the value of the property stolen served to distinguish the case from the guideline of four to five years that the court specified in Henry would apply where a range of factors such as youth and the like presented, that is not this case.” 
        
       
      
    30 This concession was pithily epitomized when she added “We’re way out of Henry territory.” 
     
      
    31 The concession was not to suggest that the current offences were of lesser seriousness. 
     
      
    32 However, his Honour observed that, “it was never an issue” that the respondent would plead guilty and it can be inferred that his Honour was assessing a discount for the plea of guilty in a utilitarian sense at or near the top of the range suggested in R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
     
      
    33 To address the first complaint of the Crown it is necessary to pay attention to what his Honour found in relation to the respondent’s subjective case, which it is contended in a submission to this Court to have been “powerful and quite unique.” Not all the subjective aspects were favourable to the respondent. Although young, born on 21 March 1983, he had been dealt with in the Children’s Court for serious offences including aggravated robbery and robbery in company. On 24 October 2003, less than two months before the bank robbery, he received a suspended sentence of two years imprisonment for robbery in company. For various and cumulating reasons he was at conditional liberty at the time of both the warehouse and the bank robberies. 
     
      
    34 However, his Honour was obviously impressed with the changes which had been wrought while the respondent had been in custody and by evidence of family support. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Huang has never denied his involvement in either of these offences. He has pleaded guilty. It was never in issue that he would plead guilty. He has expressed remorse. He has been in custody now for some eighteen months. During that time his behaviour has changed quite markedly and there is evidence, admittedly on a hearsay basis but not seriously challenged, that he has obtained a position of trust in the Correctional Centre where he is held and he has been given responsibility. He has undertaken courses. He is in a relationship with Ms Kinanne, who is in court and who has provided a statement, an affidavit in fact, on which she was not cross-examined, and he clearly has a supportive family. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Huang was born in China. His family was sponsored to immigrate to Australia by his grandparents. He did not come to Australia until he was three years old but he has been here ever since then. He was educated in Australia. His brother gave evidence today and spoke of a very difficult childhood; both parents worked very hard in the restaurant trade. There were times when the family had little money, did not have a great deal to eat and, of course, English was not their first language, so Mr Huang had a difficult time growing up. He says that he was picked on at school and there is no doubt that he slipped into juvenile offending at an early age. As Ms Fullerton put it, he started off with petty juvenile offences and moved to among the most serious offences known to the criminal law. That is why he is here today. He has written a letter in which he expresses regret and remorse. He has asked for details about restorative justice programmes in gaol and in terms of personal deterrence I would be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that his likelihood of re-offending in this way is now considerably less. 
        
       
       
        
        Although he has spent periods in Juvenile Justice Centres he has now spent a long period in an adult prison and the evidence is that he is behaving like a model prisoner. He has the support of his family and his partner to look forward to and, as I say, the chances are that he is unlikely to offend.” 
        
       
      
    35 He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Huang at times seems to have become dependent on various substances, including particularly steroids and some other drugs, but the evidence before me is that since he has been in custody during the last eighteen months, and he has managed to break any habit that he had.” 
        
       
      
    36 I do not understand the Crown to complain of the concurrency of sentence within the groups of charges referrable to the separate occasions of the warehouse robbery on the one hand, and of the bank on the other. 
     
      
    37 The matter for examination is therefore whether in respect of the first crimes, a total sentence of seven and half years with a non parole period of five years and in respect of the second group of crimes, a total sentence of five years with a non parole period of three years, lay outside of the range of a sound discretionary assessment by the first instance judge. Whilst I consider the sentences markedly lenient, when there is taken into account the utilitarian discount referrable to a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and appropriate weighing of objective and subjective factors, I am unpersuaded that the sentencing discretion should be held to have miscarried as claimed in the initial complaint by the Crown.  
     
      
    38 I turn to the second aspect of the Crown complaint. It is not insignificant in my view that his Honour expressly said that he intended partial accumulation of sentences. At the very least, some accumulation was required. His Honour knew that Jaafar, who was involved only in the bank robbery, had been dealt with by Hosking DCJ some six months previously and he had received a sentence consisting of a non parole period of two years four months with a balance term of one year eight months for his part in it. Effectively, the respondent received no punishment for the bank robbery additional to that which he had received for the warehouse robbery. 
     
      
    39 The Crown has made good its contention that the total effective sentence was, making every allowance for the factors favourable to the respondent, manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    40 As I have said, I do not understand there to be complaint about the internal structure of sentences within the counts referrable to the separate offences (save the complaint which I have rejected) and manifest inadequacy can be met by making an order for some cumulation, which I consider should be made, and which his Honour apparently intended to make but did not at all implement. 
     
      
    41 It is submitted that the residual discretion of this court should be exercised to dismiss a Crown appeal. Comparison was invited with the circumstances and result in R v Thomas [2003] NSWCCA 165. The gravity of the respondent’s participation in these organized crimes is considerable. The objective seriousness outweighs factors which can be taken into account in his favour by a sizeable margin. It is not appropriate to exercise residual discretion as sought. The result in Thomas does not persuade me to the contrary. 
     
      
    42 It can be noted, however, that a view was formed in Thomas that that respondent had “truly reached a turning point in his life and is truly determined not to re-offend.” A similar claim is made by the respondent: and see R v Osenkowski 1982 SASR 212. At the time of sentence the respondent had been in custody for eighteen months. His Honour had received in evidence a report from Ms Tanya Levin, a social worker with experience in assessment of gaol inmates with drug and alcohol issues as well as in other areas. Inter alia, she obtained reports from gaol supervisors. She recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Huang is also the personal ‘sweeper’ for Senior Assistant Superintendent Cheryl Waters who is the area manager in his division. Ms Waters describes Mr Huang as ‘one in a million inmates’. She stated that the position of sweeper goes unfilled unless an inmate can be found who is appropriate. Mr Huang’s level of integrity and work ethic is highly unusual in her experience.” 
        
       
      
    43 The respondent has now been in custody for over two years. By consent, his affidavit sworn 29 March 2006 was read. His good conduct has not abated. He is making use of opportunities within the prison system. He continues to have a “nil gaol record.” I have already cited his Honour’s relevant comments. 
     
      
    44 It is appropriate that I take into account the restraint which it is appropriate for this Court to exercise when resentencing after a Crown appeal and, by reason of the promise in the matters to which I have just referred, the resentence should be assessed at the very minimum of appropriate range. 
     
      
    45 Like his Honour, and with emphasis contributed by the respondent’s continued admirable response to his situation, I would find special circumstances so as to vary in his favour the proportion between non parole period and balance term. I note that, for count 1 the balance term set by his Honour was equivalent to one half of the non parole period and for count 4 was equivalent to two thirds. Of course having regard to the absence of accumulation, it was only the sentence on count 1 which was effective. 
     
      
    46 I would adopt the proportion applied in respect to count 1 to the total cumulated sentence which I now propose. The immediate result is to delay the respondent’s earliest date of eligibility for parole by one year. The overall consequence will be imposition of what I regard as the very least required to reflect these gravely serious crimes. 
     
      
    47 Although I have said that the assessments in respect of the individual counts and the enveloping “group” sentences were not inadequate and, as such, would not ordinarily be disturbed, it will achieve with simplicity the practical consequence that I have indicated if the sentence on count 4 is divided into a non parole period of two years and a balance term of three years and directed to commence one year before the expiry of the non parole period on count 1. 
     
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences and orders in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3 of the indictment confirmed. 
       
      3. Sentences in respect of counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the indictment confirmed, but orders in respect of those sentences quashed, and in lieu thereof sentences and orders as follows substituted: 
       
      On count 4 the respondent sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of two years to commence on 19 March 2008 and expire on 18 March 2010 with a balance term of three years to expire on 17 March 2013. 
       
      On counts 5, 6, 7 and 8 the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for fixed terms of two years to commence on 19 March 2008 and expire on 18 March 2010.  
       
      The sentences on counts 5, 6, 7, and 8 to be served concurrently with each other and with the non parole period set in respect of count 4. 
       
      The reason for setting the fixed terms is that those sentences will be completely subsumed within the non parole period fixed in respect of count 4. 
       
      4. The earliest date for eligibility of release to parole is specified as 18 March 2010.

      PB0008/2006 DCU v State Parole Authority of New South Wales 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, DCU, is a convicted sex offender. He was found guilty by two separate juries of sex offences committed, two years apart (in 1995 and 1997), against his 12-year old niece and a 26-year old female acquaintance. A total effective sentence of imprisonment for eight years and six months was imposed with a non-parole period of six years. His appeal against conviction and sentence in each case was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
    2 The Applicant denies his guilt of these crimes. He has refused to apply for a custodial sex offender’s rehabilitation program. The non-parole period component of his sentence expired on 24 November 2005. The New South Wales State Parole Authority (“SPA”), the Respondent, refused to order the Applicant’s release on parole.  
     
      
    3 The Applicant contends that he has been refused parole because he denies his guilt and could not successfully complete the custodial sex offender’s rehabilitation program for that reason. He contends that this Court should intervene by way of statutory review under s.155 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (“CAS Act”).  
     
      
       
      Nature of Application under s.155 CAS Act 
       
      
    4 Section 155 CAS Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “155  
        Application to Supreme Court by offender 
         
         
          
          (1) If: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and 
             
             
            (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit. 
           
           
          (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 Section 155 does not provide a form of appeal from a decision refusing parole: McPherson v Offenders Review Board (1991) 23 NSWLR 61 at 69. The Act does not permit the Court to set aside the SPA’s decision and either to substitute its own decision, or to return the matter to the SPA to hear the matter again. It provides for no more than a direction to the SPA that the information upon which it acted is of a particular character: McPherson at 69.  
     
      
    6 The role of the Court under s.155 CAS Act has been described as “extremely limited” and an application does not operate as a form of judicial review of an SPA decision: R v Naudi [2003] NSWCCA 160 at paragraph 19. On a s.155 application, the Court does not concern itself with questions pertaining to the merits of a decision nor with questions as to what weight is placed upon various factors: Radford v Parole Board  [2002] NSWCCA 70 at paragraph 36; McCallum v Parole Board [2003] NSWCCA 294 at paragraph 33. In Rozynski v Parole Board of New South Wales [2003] NSWCCA 214, Greg James J (Hodgson JA and Simpson J agreeing) said at paragraph 13: 
     
      
       
        
        “For my part, I consider that action under the section will not be warranted unless the statutory conditions are met as a matter of substance. This means that information before the Board will not be characterised as false, misleading or irrelevant simply because it was challenged, even if challenged on such a basis before the Board and the challenge determined adversely to the applicant, nor if it is merely incorrect in detail but not false or misleading in substance. This court will need to be satisfied on appropriate (usually new) evidence that information was false or misleading in substance, and that the direction should be given. So far as there is a determination of the Board concerning information said to be false or misleading, before the court will so categorise that information, it will be necessary to satisfy the court that the Board's determination was plainly, not just arguably, wrong and further that the information was false or misleading and material to the Board's conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    7 The Court is concerned only with information which was before the SPA and upon which the SPA decided not to release the Applicant to parole. The Court is not concerned with whether the SPA acted in accordance with the statute. That is a matter for administrative law relief in the Court. Nor is the Court concerned with whether the SPA’s decision was right or wrong, or whether the SPA correctly interpreted or construed the information before it, or whether it drew the correct inferences from that information or whether it gave the correct weight to that information. The only powers available to the Court under s.155 are to give directions to the SPA as to whether the information upon which its decision was made was false, misleading or irrelevant and to give such further directions with respect to that information as it thinks fit: McCamley v Offenders Review Board (Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 February 1994, unreported); LMS v Parole Board (1999) 110 A Crim R 172 at 174-175.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Offences 
       
      
    8 The Applicant was born on 24 October 1959. He has been in custody since 1999. Following a trial before his Honour Judge Sides QC and a jury in the Sydney District Court, he was convicted of having sexual intercourse without consent with a 26-year old woman in September 1997. The Applicant admitted that intercourse took place with the complainant but maintained that it was a consensual act. The Applicant was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years. An appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. With respect to sentence, it was argued in the Court of Criminal Appeal that the sentence imposed was towards the top of the range for offences of this type. Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) concluded that, given the circumstances of the offence, he was entirely unpersuaded that the sentence was outside of the range of the sound exercise of discretion. The appeal against sentence was dismissed.  
     
      
    9 On 25 February 2002, the Applicant was convicted following a trial before his Honour Acting Judge Downs QC and a jury in the Sydney District Court of two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years being under his authority contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s.61M(1) Crimes Act 1900. The victim in each offence was the Applicant’s 12-year old niece. The offences occurred at the Applicant’s home in January 1995 where the victim stayed for a period before the resumption of school. The offences were described in the following terms by Dowd J (Meagher JA and Barr J agreeing) in R v DCU [2003] NSWCCA 173 at paragraphs 6-9: 
     
      
       
        
        “6 The appellant's house had three bedrooms, two with single beds with the appellant's bedroom having a king-size waterbed in it. Each of the three children took turns in sleeping in the appellant's room, the complainant having slept in one of the smaller bedrooms during the week. On the last evening there was an argument between the three children as to who would sleep in the appellant's room, the appellant deciding that it was the complainant's turn.  
         
         
        7 The complainant got into the bed wearing a summer nightie and underwear. The appellant came into the bed, having locked the door of the bedroom, and watched television for about half an hour when the appellant asked the complainant to remove her nightie, which she did after initially refusing. After removing her nightie the complainant got back into bed, keeping on her underwear. The appellant came over and started licking and kissing her neck then ripped off her underwear and began touching her vagina with his fingers and rubbing her breasts for a period. These were the facts relied on in the first count.  
         
         
        8 The appellant then licked inside the complainant's vagina, rubbing her breasts at the same time. This constituted count 2. He next sat up on the side of the bed and asked the complainant to look at him, he having removed his pants, exposing his penis which he asked the complainant to touch. The complainant refused and moved to her side of the bed. The appellant then lay on her without putting his full weight on her and the complainant said that the appellant was endeavouring to push what felt like fingers or something a lot bigger inside her vagina. This act constituted count 3 in the indictment.  
         
         
        9 The complainant called out in pain several times, the appellant continuing his actions towards her for some thirty seconds to a minute but stopped at the complainant's last cry of pain. The complainant then went and slept on the floor.” 
        
       
      
    10 On 3 April 2002, his Honour Acting Judge Downs QC sentenced the Applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of three years and six months on the s.61M(1) count to commence on 25 May 2002 and to expire on 24 November 2005. With respect to the two offences under s.66C(2), his Honour sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for six years commencing on 25 May 2002 and expiring on 24 May 2008 with a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 25 May 2002 and expiring on 24 November 2005.  
     
      
    11 The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction and, with respect to sentence, concluded that it had not been shown that the sentence was other than appropriate in all the circumstances: R v DCU at paragraph 31.  
     
      
       
      Functions of the SPA 
       
      
    12 The SPA is constituted under s.183 CAS Act. The functions of the SPA include the determination of matters with respect to the granting of parole and the conditions on which parole is granted: s.185(1)(a). The SPA is not bound by the rules of evidence, but may inform itself of any matter in such manner as it thinks appropriate: clause 11(4), Schedule 1, CAS Act.  
     
      
    13 The SPA consists of at least four judicial members, at least one police officer, at least one officer of the Probation and Parole Service and at least 10 community members who should reflect, as closely as possible, the composition of the community at large: s.183(2) CAS Act. Of the community members, at least one must be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has an appreciation or understanding of the interests of victims of crime: s.183(2A) CAS Act. Thus, the SPA comprises persons with a variety of interests and expertise including the expression of community views: Medical Board of Queensland v Thurling [2003] QCA 518 at paragraph 12; SB v Queensland Community Corrections Board [2005] QSC 155 at paragraph 13. 
     
      
    14 Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of three years or less, being a sentence that has a non-parole period, the court must make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period: s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Where the sentence of imprisonment exceeds three years, and a non-parole period is fixed, then the question whether the offender will be released on parole is one for consideration by the SPA. The sentencing court will fix a non-parole period which represents the minimum period for which the offender must be held in custody for the offence. The SPA has the authority to release an offender conditionally from confinement in accordance with the sentence imposed upon him. The full sentence of imprisonment stands and during its term the prisoner is simply released upon conditional parole: Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 627-628; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 716-717 (paragraphs 55-58). It is a misnomer to speak of a minimum sentence and a maximum sentence as there is, in truth, but one sentence, being that imposed by the trial judge, which cannot be altered by the paroling authority: Power v The Queen at 629. The grant of parole by a paroling authority is a privilege and not a right: McCallum v Parole Board at paragraph 28. 
     
      
    15 Section 135 CAS Act provides for the general duty of the SPA in determining whether a parole order will be made for an offender serving a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three years. Section 135 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “135  
        General duty of Parole Authority 
         
         
          
          (1) The Parole Authority must not make a parole order for an offender unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) In deciding whether or not the release of an offender is appropriate in the public interest, the Parole Authority must have regard to the following matters: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the need to protect the safety of the community, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (c) the nature and circumstances of the offence to which the offender’s sentence relates, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (d) any relevant comments made by the sentencing court, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (e) the offender’s criminal history, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (f) the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (g) the likely effect on any victim of the offender, and on any such victim’s family, of the offender being released on parole, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (h) any report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service, as referred to in section 135A, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) any other report in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Review Council, the Commissioner or any other authority of the State, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (j) such guidelines as are in force under section 185A, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (k) such other matters as the Parole Authority considers relevant. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3) Except in exceptional circumstances, the Parole Authority must not make a parole order for a serious offender unless the Review Council advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Section 135A, which is mentioned in s.135(2)(h), is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “135A  
        Preparation of reports by Probation and Parole Service 
         
         
          
          A report prepared by or on behalf of the Probation and Parole Service for the purposes of section 135 must address the following matters: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) the likelihood of the offender being able to adapt to normal lawful community life, 
           
           
          (b) the risk of the offender re-offending while on release on parole, and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk, 
           
           
          (c) the measures to be taken to assist the offender while on release on parole, as set out in a post-release plan prepared by the Probation and Parole Service in relation to the offender, 
           
           
          (d) the offender’s attitude to the offence to which his or her sentence relates, 
           
           
          (e) the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs, and the success or otherwise of his or her participation in such programs, 
           
           
          (f) the offender’s attitude to any victim of the offence to which his or her sentence relates, and to the family of any such victim, 
           
           
          (g) any offences committed by the offender while in custody, including in particular any correctional centre offences and any offence involving an escape or attempted escape, 
          
         
         
          
          (h) the likelihood of the offender complying with any conditions to which his or her parole may be made subject.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 Accordingly, the SPA must not make a parole order for an offender unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest: s.135(1). With respect to the term “appropriate”, the High Court observed in Mitchell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 333 at 346: 
     
      
       
        
        “The phrase ‘considers … appropriate’ indicates the striking of a balance between relevant considerations so as to provide the outcome which is fit and proper.” 
        
       
      
    18 The factors identified in s.135(2) CAS Act throw light on the meaning of the term “public interest” in the present statutory context.  
     
      
    19 The report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service under s.135A is intended to provide the SPA with information relating to the offender and his circumstances by reference to the matters set out in s.135A(a)-(h). Section 135A(a) coincides with the factor contained in s.135(2)(f) CAS Act. Beyond that, the matters referred to in s.135A relate to topics not expressly contained in s.135. Nevertheless, matters such as the risk of the offender reoffending on parole and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk (s.135A(b)), the offender’s attitude to the offence to which his sentence relates (s.135A(d)), the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs and the success or otherwise of his participation in such programs (s.135A(e)) and the offender’s attitude to any victim of the offence to which his sentence relates and to the family of any such victim (s.135A(f)) touch upon some of the primary considerations in s.135(2) CSA Act.  
     
      
    20 All the matters referred to in ss.135 and 135A shed light upon the nature of matters which are relevant to the SPA’s decision whether it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that an offender’s release is appropriate in the public interest. 
     
      
       
      Circumstances Surrounding Refusal of Parole to the Applicant 
       
      
    21 At the commencement of the hearing, I directed that the Applicant was to be referred to in these proceedings as “DCU”. He was referred to in that way by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2003 (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). To use the Applicant’s name would tend to identify his niece, a victim of his crimes. In referring to documents which were before the SPA, and the SPA hearing itself, I will substitute “DCU” for the Applicant’s name. 
     
      
    22 Given that the Applicant’s non-parole period was to expire on 24 November 2005, a pre-release report dated 19 August 2005 was prepared by Justin Warne, Probation and Parole Officer. The SPA must consider whether an offender should be released to parole at least 60 days before the offender’s parole eligibility date: s.137(1) CAS Act. Mr Warne’s report was prepared to facilitate this process. 
     
      
    23 Mr Warne’s report canvassed a number of issues relevant to the Applicant. For present purposes, attention might be confined to Mr Warne’s comments concerning the Applicant’s attitude to his offences and his willingness or otherwise to undertake a custodial rehabilitation program relating to his conduct as a sex offender. The Applicant denies entirely the offences committed upon his 12-year old niece. The Applicant has maintained that, although sexual intercourse took place with his adult victim in 1997, the act was consensual and not criminal. 
     
      
    24 With respect to the Applicant’s willingness to undertake offence-targeted psychological programs, Mr Warne stated (page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “Telephone contact with the psychologist (MSPC Area 5/6) revealed that DCU was assessed using the static 99 in March 2000, while placed at Kirkconnell. According to the psychologist, he was assessed as medium/low on this tool, thus indicating that he may be eligible for the Moderate CUBIT program, an eight-month custodial-based sex offender program. However, to date DCU has not pursued a referral to take part in such program, despite recommendations from this Service, psychologists and the case management team to do so. DCU maintains that he would not be able to comply with the program’s requirement for participants to fully disclose their sexual offending because of his denial of the offences.” 
        
       
       
      CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment) is a prison-based residential therapy program for men who have sexually abused adults and/or children. 
       
      
    25 Mr Warne referred to a static risk assessment concerning the Applicant (pages 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “An LSI-R risk/needs assessment of DCU, which was carried out by this Service, places him at medium low level of intervention commensurate with the assessed risk and identified criminiogenic needs. However, DCU has been convicted of sex offences against both an adult and a child and due to the nature of the offences and the fact that he remains untreated; he must be supervised at a higher level. Accordingly, a medium level of intervention is appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        As mentioned under Offence-Targeted programs, the Board is also advised that in 2000 DCU was assessed at ‘the high level of medium/low on the static 99’, an actuarial measure based on empirical factors found to be associated with sexual and violent recidivism.” 
        
       
      
    26 Mr Warne’s report concluded with the following summary and recommendations (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “DCU’s behaviour appears to have improved significantly over the past several years and he has received positive feedback from Correctional and Educational Officers in recent times. However, past reports of demanding and manipulative behaviour remain a concern given his status as a repeat sex offender who continues to deny his offences. Furthermore, DCU has thus far failed to undertake a custodial sex offender program despite recommendations to do so from this Service and the Correctional Centre case management team. DCU has adequate time to proceed with a CUBIT referral and to complete a relevant sex offender program prior to his sentence expiry. It is recommended therefore that he not be released to parole at this stage and that he be encouraged to address his offending behaviour by satisfactorily completing a program.” 
        
       
      
    27 Mr Ken Mayes, Unit Leader, at the Long Bay Parole Unit, supported Mr Warne’s recommendation in the following terms (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “DCU’s behaviour in custody has improved considerably and he has significant support in the community. However, he continues to deny his sexual offending, despite being convicted on two separate occasions, and makes himself unavailable for appropriate programs. His failure to acknowledge and address his offending indicates he remains an unacceptable risk to the community. Mr Warne’s recommendation is supported.” 
        
       
      
    28 On 6 September 2005, the Applicant provided a written submission to the SPA. He stated that he was not suitable to enter the CUBIT or CORE (CUBIT Out Reach) programs as he denied having committed his offences. He asserted that the CUBIT program had a low success rate. He provided the SPA with reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 18 August 2005 and Ms Anna Robilliard, psychologist, dated 30 August 2005.  
     
      
    29 Dr Nielssen had interviewed the Applicant on 28 July 2005 for the purpose of preparing a report. Dr Nielssen had been provided with a number of documents, including an earlier report of Ms Robilliard dated 23 November 1999. That report had been prepared for the purpose of sentencing proceedings following the Applicant’s conviction for the offence against the adult victim, but before he had been arrested for the offences against his 12-year old niece. Dr Nielssen noted, in passing, that the Applicant had told Ms Robilliard in 1999 that he had been subjected to sexual interference by a music teacher (who later became his soccer coach) when he was aged 10 or 11 years. Dr Nielssen concluded his report of 18 August 2005 (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe DCU is a low risk offender with good prospects for returning to become a productive and law abiding member of society. I do not believe DCU requires any counselling or other treatment offered in custody or that a further period of imprisonment will in any way reduce the risk he would pose to the community.” 
        
       
       
      However, this opinion was expressed shortly after Dr Nielssen had observed (page 7): 
       
       
        
        “It is difficult to assess the risk of further offending because of the unusual combination of offences and other variables. The two offences are quite different and do not fit any kind of pattern.” 
        
       
       
       
      
    30 Ms Robilliard stated in her report of 30 August 2005 (page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “The client has not undertaken courses in anger management, drug and alcohol or relapse prevention, as he does not see them as relevant personal issues. Nor has he applied to do the sex offenders programme. DCU continues to adhere to his original pleas of not guilty so he would not be seen as an appropriate candidate. At our meeting today DCU said he would rather serve out his entire sentence than submit to treatment designed for sexual offenders, as he does not see himself as a sexual offender.” 
        
       
      
    31 Ms Robilliard repeated later in her report that “the client is adamant that he will not apply to participate in the sex offender program because he continues to maintain that he is not a sex offender” (page 6). Ms Robilliard’s report does not proffer an opinion concerning the risk of the Applicant reoffending. At one point, she described the Applicant as having “self imposed boundaries” (page 7).  
     
      
    32 On 16 September 2005, the SPA formed an initial intention not to release DCU on parole: s.139(1) CAS Act. A hearing was fixed under s.139(5) for 27 October 2005 for the purpose of a decision being made under s.135(1) CAS Act. The reasons provided by the SPA for this initial decision were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unable to adapt to normal lawful community life; risk of reoffending; need to address offending behaviour (sex offending).” 
        
       
      
    33 Mr Warne prepared a supplementary pre-release report dated 17 October 2005. Mr Warne stated (page 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “An attempt was made to interview DCU regarding his current situation and discuss program pathways, however he terminated the interview stating ‘You do not recommend anyone. It doesn’t matter what you say it’s a closed shop’.” 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Warne indicated that a further static risk assessment had been carried out with respect to the Applicant (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “At the request of this Service, the STATIC-99 was re-administered by MSPC psychologist, Ms Victoria Bel, on 13 October 2005. Ms Bel advised that DCU now falls within the high risk range of sexual re-offending. It is the recommendation of the Acting Coordinator of Sex Offender Programs that ‘a request be made by the Board for a full psychological risk assessment to be conducted’.” 
        
       
      
    35 Mr Warne had sought clarification concerning the Applicant’s suitability and eligibility for the CUBIT program (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to clarify issues regarding DCU’s suitability and eligibility for custodial based CUBIT programs, telephone contact was made with the Therapeutic Manager of CUBIT, who indicated that DCU needed to give his consent for a CUBIT referral to proceed in order to assess him as suitable for program participation. The Therapeutic Manager confirmed that they will work with offenders expressing denial, hence the need for a full CUBIT referral to make a clear decision regarding DCU’s case. The psychologists in Area 5 MSPC confirmed that they had not informed DCU that he was unsuitable for CUBIT but had informed him that he was required to consent to a CUBIT assessment before such a decision could be made."" 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Warne’s assessment and recommendation was in the following terms (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The recommendation contained in the Pre Release Report dated 19 August 2005 remains unchanged. That is, it is recommended that DCU not be released to parole until he has completed a relevant sex offender program in custody. It is also recommended that the Board request a full psychological risk assessment prior to any future parole consideration, as recommended by the Acting Coordinator of Sex Offender Programs.” 
        
       
      
    37 Joanne Kennedy, the Manager of the Long Bay Parole Unit, supported Mr Warne’s recommendation in the following terms (page 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “With regard to static factors alone, DCU has been assessed as a High risk of sexual re-offending. His refusal to participate in a psychological assessment means that his dynamic risk factors remain unknown. While a comprehensive risk assessment may assist to elucidate these issues, this Service will continue to recommend that DCU participate in the CUBIT program. Mr Warne’s recommendation is supported.” 
        
       
      
    38 The SPA hearing was scheduled for 27 October 2005, but was adjourned to 10 November 2005 to meet the convenience of the Applicant’s counsel, Mr Wetmore.  
     
      
    39 At the SPA hearing on 10 November 2005, the Applicant and Mr Wetmore appeared. The SPA comprised the Chairperson, his Honour Judge Christie QC, and six members. The Chairperson indicated that the reason that the SPA had expressed an intention to refuse parole was “by reason of his need to address his offending behaviour” (T2.3). The Applicant stated that he maintained his innocence (T2.18). In the course of the Applicant’s evidence, he was asked by Mr Wetmore (T2.41): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Just so we’re clear on the record, you do not agree that you were appropriate  
        [sic] 
         convicted. Is that the case? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
         
         
        Q. You don’t wish to go into CUBIT, is that correct? 
         
        A. That’s right.” 
        
       
      
    40 The Applicant told his counsel that, should he be released, he was prepared to accept counselling and strict supervision (T4.14). A member of the SPA then directed questions to the Applicant concerning his willingness to accept post-release counselling and supervision but not to undertake a custodial rehabilitation program. In substance, the Applicant maintained an unwillingness to undertake the CUBIT program (T4.25-5.22). The Applicant indicated that he denied the offences, but said “I’m taking responsibility for what led me into gaol” (T5.30).  
     
      
    41 Mr Warne gave evidence at the SPA hearing. He adhered to the recommendations made in his reports (T7.8). He confirmed that he had seen Dr Nielssen’s report and stated that he was “quite surprised with the difference in assessments” (T7.27). Mr Warne agreed that Dr Nielssen was a highly respected psychiatrist (T7.37). Mr Wetmore asked Mr Warne (T8.3): 
     
      
       
        
        “WETMORE: Q. Otherwise in the refusal to admit offences, is it correct to say that’s the only real problem? 
         
        A. The other problem I guess is that he hasn’t undertaken any programmes whilst in custody to address his sexual offending. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That would be CUBIT, wouldn’t it? 
         
        A. That’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    42 Mr Wetmore addressed the SPA and referred to the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard (T9.5). It is clear that the members of the SPA were aware of those reports and their contents. Following a short adjournment, the Chairperson said (T9.31): 
     
      
       
        
        “DCU, the Authority has considered all that you’ve said, all that’s been put on your behalf and obviously we’ve considered the evidence of the probation and parole officer and the contents of various reports and documentation contained within the file. 
        
       
       
        
        The Authority is of the view that parole will be refused for the reasons that were stated on 16 September 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        The Authority is prepared to stand the matter over for parole consideration to 10 November 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        The Authority in the meantime will seek all reports, including a full psychological assessment and report regarding risk. 
        
       
       
        
        The Authority will consider those reports, including that psychological report on 10 November 2006. You will not be required to attend that meeting but you will be advised of the outcome of that meeting shortly thereafter.” 
        
       
      
    43 A notification of determination of the SPA to refuse parole to the Applicant was issued by the Secretary to the SPA on 10 November 2005 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “TAKE NOTICE that the State Parole Authority, at its meeting on 10 November 2005 considered the case of the offender and determined that the offender not be released from a correctional centre until further reviewed by the State Parole Authority, for the following reasons:- 
        
       
       
        
        The State Parole Authority has sufficient reason to believe that if released form custody at this time the offender would not be able to adapt to normal lawful community life; risk of reoffending; need to address offending behaviour 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Stand over to 10 November 2006 for probation and parole officer’s report, correctional centre report and psychological assessment/report regarding risk for parole consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        Reports required not later than 23 October 2006 
        .” 
        
       
       
      Relevance to the Grant or Refusal of Parole of a Sex Offender’s Denial of Guilt and Refusal to Undertake Custodial Treatment Programs  
       
      
    44 It appears that a number of the issues raised on this application have arisen in other jurisdictions where a parole authority considers the grant of parole to a sex offender. Although my attention was not drawn to some of these authorities at the hearing of this application, it is appropriate that I refer to them before moving to consider the Applicant’s arguments in this case. 
     
      
    45 The decisions in question have been made in the United Kingdom, Queensland and Western Australia. Although there are some differences between the parole legislation considered in the various decisions to which reference will shortly be made and ss.135 and 135A CAS Act, there is a broad similarity between the statutory functions and criteria applicable in the various jurisdictions. 
     
      
    46 The following propositions emerge from the cases. 
     
      
    47 Firstly, the parole authority starts from the premise that the offender is guilty. It is not for the parole authority to seek to go behind the conviction in some way or to examine the trial process to assess the strength of the Crown case or to review the correctness of the verdict: Mott v Queensland Community Corrections Board (1995) 2 QdR 261 at 269-270 (Fitzgerald P); R v Secretary of State for Home Department; Ex parte Lillycrop [1996] EWHC Admin 281 at paragraph 15; R v Secretary of State for Home Department; Ex parte Hepworth [1997] EWHC Admin 324 at paragraphs 45-46. 
     
      
    48 Secondly, it would be erroneous to refuse parole solely because of a denial of guilt by the offender and a refusal or inability to undertake a custodial treatment program: Mott at 271, 275; Lillycrop at paragraphs 12, 18; Hepworth at paragraphs 45, 47; Walker v Corrective Services Commission (Qld) (1999) 104 A Crim R 127 at 134 [16] (refusal of remissions); Varney v Parole Board (WA) (2000) 23 WAR 187 at 205 [57], 209 [79] (Ipp J). 
     
      
    49 In Varney, Malcolm CJ (at 190 [3]) and Ipp J (at 204-205 [55]-[56]) observed that there might be many reasons why a prisoner would not accept his guilt. These include an unwillingness to accept that he had lied in the past, an unwillingness to confront loss of face in accepting what has previously been denied and the possibility that the prisoner had been wrongly convicted. In Galli v NSW State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 206, Adams J observed at paragraph 18 that there are a number of reasons why people do not admit their offences and amongst the strongest of those reasons is shame.  
     
      
    50 Thirdly, although a decision to refuse parole based solely upon the offender’s denial of guilt and refusal or inability to enter a rehabilitation program would be erroneous, these matters remain relevant to the decision whether to grant or refuse parole: Mott at 269-270 (Fitzgerald P), 271-272 (Davies JA), 275-276 (McPherson JA); Varney at 208 [71] (Ipp J). 
     
      
    51 In Mott, Davies JA said at 271.36: 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither the respondent’s denial of guilt nor his consequent unsuitability for participation in a sexual offender’s program was a reason for refusing parole. But, read in context, I do not think that the appellant’s reasons assert that either was. On the other hand his successful completion of that program, denied to him by his denial, would have been a factor in his favour. It was only in this negative sense that the appellant took the respondent’s denial of guilt into account. In taking it into account in this limited way I do not think that the appellant can be said to have taken into account an irrelevant consideration in arriving at its decision.” 
        
       
       
      Davies JA observed at 272.6: 
       
       
        
        “The true basis upon which the appellant thought that the respondent’s denial of guilt was relevant was that it denied the respondent the opportunity of participating in a program, successful completion of which may well have enhanced his case for parole.” 
        
       
      
    52 In Mott, McPherson JA at 275-276 pointed to the way in which denial of guilt and refusal or inability to undertake a rehabilitation program may be relevant to a parole decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “Within the limits marked out by these two extremes there is an area in which an applicant’s refusal to acknowledge guilt might have more or less significance to a decision whether to release on parole. I do not think the difficulty can be altogether resolved by saying that the Board is bound to accept and act upon the fact of the conviction alone. The question is not whether an applicant for parole has (as must always be the case) been convicted, but whether his refusal to acknowledge guilt may be regarded as a relevant consideration in assessing his application for parole. It is not difficult to see that in some circumstances it may be a factor relevant to the process of rehabilitation. An offender who has come to terms with his guilt, and is genuinely remorseful about it, would ordinarily be a more suitable candidate for parole than one who refuses to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, it cannot be suggested that the Board adopted or acted upon a rule that the applicant must be refused parole simply because he failed to admit his guilt of the offence of murder of which he was convicted.” 
        
       
      
    53 In Varney, the Applicant had applied seven times unsuccessfully for admission to the custodial sex offender treatment program. It was accepted, in that case, that due to funding restrictions, that program was only available to persons who admitted their guilt (see 196 [24], 204-205 [55]-[56]). In this respect, Ipp J (Malcolm CJ and Wallwork J agreeing) said at 208 [71]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that in coming to its decision the Board took into account the denial of guilt by the applicant and the fact that for that reason he was not admitted to and did not undertake the SOTP  
        [Sex Offenders Treatment Programme] 
        . In my view, the inference to be drawn from the words expressing the decision is that the Board had regard to these matters on the basis that both the denial of guilt and the non-participation in the SOTP were factors tending to render the applicant unsuitable for parole. In my view, the Board was entitled to regard these matters in that light and so take them into consideration: see  
        Mott v Community Corrections Board (Qld) 
         [1995] 2 Qd R 261 at 268-270, per Fitzgerald P; at 275-276, per McPherson JA; at 271, per Davies JA; R v  
        Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Zulfikar 
        ;  
        R v Parole Board; Ex parte Zulfikar 
        .” 
        
       
      
    54 In my opinion, the principles emerging from these cases represent a sound foundation for consideration of the present case.  
     
      
    55 The authorities from other jurisdictions make clear that an offender’s denial of guilt and refusal or inability to attend a custodial rehabilitation program may be relevant factors in a determination as to whether parole ought be granted or refused. It will be necessary for the parole authority to have regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. I now turn to the grounds advanced by the Applicant in this case. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s s.155 Grounds 
       
      
    56 Mr Haesler SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the decision of the SPA had been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information upon a number of grounds. 
     
      
    57 The first ground contended that the supplementary pre-release report of Mr Warne dated 17 October 2005 contained misleading, irrelevant and false information in the following respects: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The reliance on the Static 99 alone as a predictor of risk was misleading. 
         
         
        (b) The requirement that the applicant submit to a full psychological assessment was misleading and irrelevant as two full psychological reports had been provided. 
         
         
        (c) the recommendation that the applicant not be released to parole until he had completed a relevant sex offender course in custody created the false impression that the applicant could successfully complete the course and that such completion would reduce the risk of offending behaviour. 
         
         
        (d) The recommendation that the applicant not be released to parole until he had completed a relevant sex offender course involved the application of a blanket policy without proper reference to the individual circumstances of the applicant. 
         
         
        (e) The report failed to consider alternatives to refusal of parole including the risk to the community of the offender’s unsupervised release after completion of the balance of his sentence, the finding of the sentencing judge that parole be considered despite his denial of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    58 As there is a degree of overlap in the matters advanced by the Applicant in the first ground, it is useful to deal with a number of the arguments together. In doing so, I bear in mind the limited nature of the function which the Court exercises under s.155(1) CAS Act.  
     
      
    The Denial of Guilt Issue 
     
      
    59 Mr Haesler SC submitted that the Applicant’s denial of his criminal conduct meant that he would not be admitted into the CUBIT program or, if he was, he would be doomed to exclusion from the program. Mr Lonergan, for the SPA, submitted that the correct conclusion on the information before the SPA is that the Applicant refused to apply to enter the CUBIT program because he denied that he was a sex offender. This was not a case where the Applicant had applied for admission and had been rejected. 60 The information before the SPA was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
      (a) officers of the Probation and Parole Service, psychologists and the case management team had recommended to the Applicant that he apply for the CUBIT program; 
       
       
      (b) the Applicant refused to apply for the program as he maintained that he was not a sex offender; 
       
       
      (c) the fact that the Applicant denied his offences did not mean that he would be refused admission to the CUBIT program. 
       
      
    61 A document entitled “Institutional Programs for Sexual Offenders: CUBIT, CORE and Custodial Maintenance”, Version 02-2003, was tendered at the hearing before me. That document confirms that a person will not be admitted to the CUBIT program without his consent. The treatment targets of the program address a number of issues, including targeting denial and minimisation of offending behaviour, victim impact and empathy, changing sexual arousal and sexual regulation patterns and relationship and appropriate sexuality skills. It is apparent from these topics that denial and minimisation of offending behaviour is to be expected in some offenders. It does not disqualify an offender from eligibility for the program. 
     
      
    62 It appears that factors, such as shame (which may inhibit a sex offender from admitting his guilt) are the types of matters which the CUBIT program seeks to address. Recognition that the CUBIT program seeks to target denial and minimisation of offending behaviour confirms this view. 
     
      
    63 According to the document, in the initial stage of treatment, each participant is required to provide a full disclosure of his sexually offending behaviour and related issues. If an offender is unable to do so, he is likely to be unable to acknowledge and address the effects of his offending on his victims, understand his offence cycle and develop a viable relapse prevention plan to manage his risk for future offending. Ongoing failure to take responsibility for offending behaviour may lead to removal from treatment. It is these features of the CUBIT program which Mr Haesler SC emphasised in his submissions. He contended that the Applicant could not meet these requirements of the program and would be excluded from it for that reason. He submitted that the Applicant’s continuing denial of his offences ought not operate as a governing factor leading to refusal of parole.  
     
      
    64 The Applicant was convicted of serious sex offences following two separate trials. His appeals against conviction were dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The SPA exercises its statutory functions as part of the criminal justice process concerning sentence. The SPA is bound to approach its functions upon the basis that the offender is guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted and that the crimes involved the factual matters established by the trial and sentencing court. It is not for the SPA to go behind these findings of guilt: Mott; Lillycrop; Hepworth. 
     
      
    65 Accordingly, the SPA was to exercise its statutory functions with respect to the Applicant upon the basis that he had committed the acts referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 above, which constituted serious criminal offences, but that the Applicant continued to deny that he had committed these crimes.  
     
      
    66 During the course of the hearing, I raised with counsel the fact that a similar issue has been considered in a different statutory context and for a different purpose. Where a medical practitioner has been deregistered for professional misconduct involving sexual misconduct with patients which was denied by the practitioner, the question of the practitioner’s approach to the misconduct is relevant if an application is made for re-registration at a later time. The function being undertaken by the Medical Tribunal in this respect is primarily for the protection of the public: Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 637. A medical practitioner who has been deregistered because of proven misconduct is not required to confess before he is reinstated. However, continuing vigorous challenge to clearly established guilt may be indicative of continuing unfitness: Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 100. 
     
      
    67 The Zaidi principle is broadly consistent with the approach taken in parole cases in other jurisdictions referred to above. An offender’s continuing denial of guilt ought not operate as an automatic disqualifying factor with respect to parole. Nevertheless, it is relevant to the parole decision. Likewise, a refusal to apply for entry to a custodial sex offender’s program is relevant to the parole decision. It is necessary, however, that the SPA consider all the circumstances of the case, including these features, in determining whether parole will be granted or refused. 
     
      
    68 The Applicant had been in custody since being sentenced in 1999. The SPA was required under ss.135 and 135A CAS Act to give direct consideration to the Applicant’s risk of reoffending and associated matters. There was, within the prison system, a treatment program available for sex offenders which assisted the process of risk assessment with respect to those offenders. It is understandable that the SPA would regard this program as being the primary method of assessing sex offenders in the interests of reducing the risk of reoffending and promoting rehabilitation. A refusal by an offender to apply to enter the program is a factor which the SPA is able to take into account.  
     
      
    69 The Applicant relied upon the decision of Adams J in Galli. It does not appear from an examination of his Honour’s judgment that the information provided to his Honour concerning eligibility for the CUBIT program was the same as that which was placed before me. I agree with his Honour’s observation at paragraph 7 that the question for the SPA is whether, in all the circumstances, an offender should be released to parole having regard to the criteria specified in the CAS Act. I agree with Adams J’s comment in Galli at paragraph 7 that the nature of the offending itself is of significant importance. However, there are significant factual differences between the present case and Galli. In Galli, the offence involved a single incident which was said to be out of character for the offender (paragraph 7). In the present case, the Applicant committed offences against two victims, with the 1995 offences involving a 12-year old female relative and the 1997 offence involving a 26-year old female acquaintance. This history of offending was one which Dr Nielssen considered made an assessment of the risk of reoffending a difficult one.  
     
      
    70 Unlike the Applicant in Galli, the present Applicant was a repeat sex offender with offences involving both adult and child victims. The repetition of serious offences sheds light upon the risk of reoffending. It is not the evidence in the present case that the Applicant has been refused access to the sex offender program because he has denied his guilt of the offences. In this respect, the Applicant is in a different position to the offender in Varney who had applied on seven occasions, unsuccessfully, for admission to the custodial sex offender’s treatment program. Rather, despite recommendations made by the Probation and Parole Service, psychologists and the case management team, the Applicant has refused to apply for the custodial sex offender program.  
     
      
    71 The Applicant relied upon the decision of Rothman J in Esho v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 304 where his Honour observed at paragraph 48 that the offender (who was not a sex offender) had undertaken all custodial programs available to him except one for which he was unavailable because of his lack of English. I do not consider that there is any parallel with the present case, where the Applicant has declined to apply for the CUBIT program despite recommendations by relevant personnel that he should do so.  
     
      
       
      The Blanket Policy Issue 
       
      
    72 Mr Haesler SC submitted, by reference to Green v Daniels (1977) 51 ALJR 463, that the SPA applied an inflexible general rule to the Applicant which involved the taking into account of false and irrelevant material, being a blanket policy to refuse parole to sex offenders who had not undertaken the CUBIT program.  
     
      
    73 Green v Daniels was not a case of inflexible application of policy. Rather, Stephen J at 467, said that it raised the question whether the departmental policy or instructions revealed an attempt to substitute inconsistent departmental criteria for those which the Parliament had enacted: Cummeragunga Pty Limited (In Liq) v Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (2004) 210 ALR 612 at 630.  
     
      
    74 In my opinion, the approach of the SPA does not reveal the application of a blanket policy to the Applicant’s case. The SPA has not attempted to substitute inconsistent criteria for those which the Parliament has enacted. Consideration of a sex offender’s preparedness to undertake a custodial sex offender’s program is not inconsistent with the statutory criteria in ss.135 and 135A. There is express reference in s.135A(e) to the offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs. Further, s.135(2)(k) enables the SPA to have regard to such other matters as the SPA considers relevant. This provision is one of considerable width as it allows the SPA to determine what is relevant: McCallum v Parole Board at paragraph 28. Of course, that determination would not permit the SPA to have regard to considerations which were entirely extraneous to the statutory decision to be made under s.135(1) CAS Act.  
     
      
    75 In assessing the Applicant’s submission based upon Green v Daniels, it is pertinent to refer to material which sheds light upon the purpose and object of ss.135 and 135A CAS Act. In the course of the second reading speech with respect to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Amendment (Parole) Bill 2004, being the legislation which established the SPA and enacted ss.135 and 135A in their present form, the Minister for Justice, Mr Hatzistergos said (Hansard, Legislative Council, 9 December 2004): 
     
      
       
        
        “Parole is a pivotal phase in the rehabilitation of an offender. The Government recognises, however, that not all offenders are eager to address their offending behaviour. The Government is of the view that an offender wanting parole should display a desire to behave lawfully and a willingness to address his or her offending behaviour. An underlying principle of the bill before the House is that parole is a privilege not a right.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The need to protect the community is a theme that flows through the bill. Proposed new section 135 relates to the general duty of the SPA. New section 135(2) contains several matters that previously the SPA did not have to take into account in deciding whether the release of an offender was in the public interest. The new matters that must be taken into account are the need to protect the community, the need to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, the nature and circumstances of the offence, and guidelines established by the SPA in consultation with the Minister in relation to the exercise of the SPA’s function. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        New section 135A sets out matters to be addressed in a report provided to the SPA by the Probation and Parole Service in relation to the granting of parole to an offender. The SPA will also address these factors in its decision. The Probation and Parole Service must examine such things as the risk of the offender reoffending while on parole and the measures to be taken to reduce that risk. The offender’s willingness to participate in rehabilitation programs, and the offender’s success or otherwise in such programs must be commented upon. The report is to address the offender’s attitude to any victim of the offence, and to the family of any such victim. In section 135A the Government is ensuring that the SPA, which is essentially a decision-making body, is provided with the information that it needs from the Probation and Parole Service to make informed decisions. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The Government is of the view that the SPA is in the best position to determine whether an offender should be entitled to a review hearing. In some cases the SPA will recognise at the outset that a review hearing will be necessary in order to make a final decision in respect of parole. In other cases the onus will be placed rightly on the offender to satisfy the SPA by way of a written application that the offender‘s circumstances warrant a review hearing. Most people would agree, for example, that a sex offender should not be automatically entitled to a review hearing if the offender has refused to participate in the sex offender programs offered by the Department of Corrective Services. New sections 139 and 146 recognise, among other things, that the SPA has finite resources that should not be wasted on offenders who have made no attempt to address their offending behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    76 The SPA is the decision-making body for the purposes of ss.135 and 139 CAS Act. Both provisions are relevant to this case. The SPA must look to the terms of the CAS Act itself in determining the matters to take into account in its decision-making process. The Green v Daniels submission of the Applicant contends that the SPA is substituting criteria in its decision making which are inconsistent with the criteria which Parliament has enacted. The observations of the Minister in the second reading speech tend to confirm the relevance of factors such as an offender’s willingness to undertake a custodial sex offender’s program to the exercise of the SPA’s statutory functions. It is, of course, necessary for the SPA to consider all the circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, an offender’s willingness or unwillingness to undertake such a program is an important factor. 
     
      
    77 Against the background of these general observations, I return to the specific grounds raised by the Applicant.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Specific Grounds 
       
      
    78 Ground 1(a) asserts that the SPA’s reliance on the Static 99 alone as a predictor of risk was misleading. Mr Haesler SC submitted that the SPA relied solely upon a static risk assessment and took no account of Dr Nielssen’s and Ms Robilliard’s risk assessments. He submits that, as a result, the SPA ‘s decision was made on the basis of irrelevant information for the purposes of s.155(1)(b) CAS Act.  
     
      
    79 Mr Lonergan submits that the SPA had before it all the information, including the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard, and that the SPA did not state that it was acting alone by reference to the static risk assessment. He submitted that it was but one criterion taken into account. There was limited material available to the SPA by way of dynamic risk assessment. Dr Nielssen’s report contained limited analysis and his opinion was expressed shortly after he had indicated that an assessment was difficult in the circumstances of this case. The SPA decided that it would not release the Applicant to parole and requested that a full psychological assessment and report be prepared for the next occasion when the Applicant’s case came before the SPA.  
     
      
    80 It is clear that the SPA had regard to all the information before it, including the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard. It was a matter for the SPA to form its own view with respect to the material in reaching a decision for the purpose of s.135(1) CAS Act. Ms Robilliard’s report did not contain a risk assessment. Dr Nielssen’s report expressed an opinion, but with limited explanation as to how the opinion had been formed. I am not satisfied that the SPA relied on the Static 99 risk assessment alone as a predictor. I note that Static 99 appears to be used in other jurisdictions as part of the risk assessment process for sex offenders. See, for example, Oakes v Corrective Services (Qld) (2004) 144 A Crim R 334 at 339; Green v R [2004] NTSC 65 at paragraph 19; R v Armfield (2005) 155 A Crim R 299 at 314 (SA); Director of Public Prosecutions v TP [2005] VSCA 88 at paragraph 17. It appears to be a common tool in risk assessment of sex offenders, although it forms only part of the process. I am not satisfied that the decision has been based on misleading information in the manner alleged in Ground 1(a). 
     
      
    81 Ground 1(b) contends that the SPA acted on misleading and irrelevant information by requiring that the Applicant submit to a full psychological assessment when there were two full reports (those of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard) already provided to them. As I have noted, Ms Robilliard’s report contained no risk assessment concerning the Applicant and Dr Nielssen’s report was based upon the limited analysis contained in his report.  
     
      
    82 In my view, the SPA was not bound to act upon the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard. It was open to the SPA to determine that a full psychological assessment ought be obtained concerning the Applicant. It appears that the SPA’s view was that a dynamic risk assessment ought be provided with that assessment taking into account the Applicant’s response to a custodial treatment program. Although Dr Nielssen is an experienced forensic psychiatrist, his conclusion was based upon a single interview with the Applicant together with written material which had been provided to him. I am not satisfied that the SPA decision has taken into account misleading and irrelevant information by fixing a requirement that a full psychological assessment be provided with respect to the Applicant for future consideration. This course was open to the SPA in the discharge of its statutory functions concerning the Applicant and no basis for a direction under s.155 has been demonstrated in this respect. 
     
      
    83 Ground 1(c) contends that the recommendation that the Applicant not be released to parole until he had completed a relevant sex offender course in custody created the false impression that the Applicant could successfully complete the course and that such completion would reduce the risk of offending behaviour. Mr Haesler SC submitted that, even if the Applicant could be admitted to the CUBIT program, he could not complete it. Further, he submitted that the SPA acted upon the false impression that completion of the CUBIT program would reduce the risk of the Applicant reoffending. Mr Lonergan submitted this was an erroneous construction of what the SPA had done and that no basis for a s.155 direction arose in this respect.  
     
      
    84 The factors which the SPA identified as the reasons for refusing parole included the Applicant’s risk of reoffending, his need to address his offending behaviour and his inability to adapt to normal lawful community life. The SPA stood the matter over to 10 November 2006 with reports to be provided no later than 23 October 2006 being a Probation and Parole Officer’s report, a Correctional Centre report, and a psychological assessment/report regarding the Applicant’s risk of reoffending. Mr Haesler SC submits that these requirements necessarily demand that the Applicant undertake and complete the CUBIT program which can then be the subject of a psychological assessment and report with respect to his risk of reoffending. He contends that this is implicit in the SPA’s decision.  
     
      
    85 I accept that it is implicit in the SPA’s decision that the Applicant ought apply for and enter the CUBIT program in accordance with recommendations made to him. However, the Applicant has not demonstrated that the decision took into account false information for the purposes of s.155 of the Act. The information before the SPA was that it had been recommended that the Applicant undertake the CUBIT program. He declined to do so as he denied being a sex offender. Whether that attitude of denial is maintained should he be admitted to the program would depend upon the Applicant’s response to the program once admitted. It may be that the Applicant’s attitude would cause a problem for his continuation in the program. Then again, the Applicant’s attitude may change as a result of the processes to be undertaken as part of the program. That, after all, is one of the purposes of the program which includes the targeting of denial and minimisation of offending behaviour. In my view, the Applicant’s election not to enter the program ought not then be able to be utilised in his favour as a means of neutralising concerns about his risk of reoffending. On the information before the SPA, the Applicant had not accepted treatment for his offending behaviour whilst in custody. 
     
      
    86 Because the Applicant placed information before the SPA (in his 6 September 2005 submission) concerning the suggested low success rate of the CUBIT program, the SPA provided information to me, by way of submission, concerning that topic. I was informed that, between January 1999 and September 2005, 60% of those who commenced the CUBIT program had completed it. Following changes to the program which commenced in September 2005, it was expected that completion rates between September 2005 and May 2006 would be around 99%, namely a drop-out rate of 1%. I was informed that denial of certain aspects of offending (for example, denial of a particular sexual act) does not render an offender ineligible for the CUBIT program. Categorical denial (that is, absolute denial of any sexual or other contact with the victim) may result in ineligibility for CUBIT. It was noted that offenders who categorically deny their offending are unlikely to accept a referral to CUBIT, on account of accepting a referral to CUBIT is seen as “wanting treatment” for sexual offending.  
     
      
    87 It appears that the Applicant’s attitude up to the present time has fallen into the lastmentioned category, namely, that he does not want to be seen as wanting treatment for sexual offending. He says that he does not need it. In reference to other factors which may bear upon his eligibility for CUBIT, I note that the Applicant acknowledges an association with his two victims and, in one case, admits that sexual contact occurred. He accepts that he had sexual intercourse with the adult victim, but maintains that it was consensual. He denies any sexual offence with respect to his 12-year old niece, although, as a relative of the Applicant, she was no stranger to him.  
     
      
    88 Until the Applicant applies for entry to the CUBIT program, it cannot be known whether he will be refused entry or, if he is admitted, whether he will fail to complete it. It is an understandable position of the SPA that sex offenders, in particular repeat sex offenders against different victims, ought be encouraged to undertake the CUBIT program. 
     
      
    89 Information provided to the Court, by way of submission, indicates that the Static 99 risk assessment has a predictive accuracy of .71 which represents moderate prediction and a significant improvement on clinical opinion. It is said that risk assessment will be more robust when results of the Static 99 are provided in conjunction with a thorough analysis of dynamic risk factors.  
     
      
    90 I am not satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated a basis for a s.155 direction arising from Ground 1(c). 
     
      
    91 Ground 1(d) asserts that the recommendation that the Applicant not be released to parole until he had completed a relevant sex offender course involved the application of a blanket policy without proper reference to the individual circumstances of the Applicant. I have mentioned earlier Mr Haesler SC’s reliance upon Green v Daniels. I am not satisfied that the principle in Green v Daniels operates in the Applicant’s favour in this case. I am not satisfied that the SPA applied a blanket policy in this case without proper reference to the individual circumstances of the Applicant.  
     
      
    92 All the material was before the SPA. Sections 135 and 135A require the SPA to have regard to a range of factors, including the Applicant’s risk of reoffending and the protection of the community. The utilisation of a custodial sex offender’s program in New South Wales, and the expectation that sex offenders involve themselves in such a program whilst in custody is not, in my view, an approach that is inconsistent with ss.135 and 135A of the Act. Whilst offenders remain in custody, there is an opportunity for extended assessment and counselling in the CUBIT program. It might be expected that many offenders will find that process troubling, difficult and uncomfortable. Many offenders may prefer not to do it at all. Nevertheless, it is open to the SPA to regard the undertaking of the CUBIT program by a sex offender as a most important matter bearing upon the decision whether to grant parole. 93 Ground 1(e) contends that the supplementary pre-release report failed to consider alternatives to refusal of parole including the risk to the community of the offender’s unsupervised release after completion of the balance of his sentence and the finding of the sentencing judge that parole be considered despite the Applicant’s denial of guilt. It is important to bear in mind that s.155 CAS Act directs attention to the question whether the SPA’s decision was made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information. The supplementary pre-release report was but one piece of information, albeit an important one, which was before the SPA. Other information before the SPA included the reports of Dr Nielssen and Mr Robilliard and the evidence given at the SPA hearing on 10 November 2005. The SPA comprised seven members, including a judicial member, all of whom had been provided with the totality of the written material. Ground 1(e) does not contend directly that the decision of the SPA was based upon false, misleading or irrelevant material.  
     
      
    94 It was a matter for the SPA, based upon all the material before it, to form its own view as to whether it could reach the level of satisfaction on the balance of probabilities, required by s.135(1) CAS Act. The SPA had before it information about the Applicant’s proposed post-release arrangements. No basis has been demonstrated by reference to Ground 1(e) for a direction under s.155 CAS Act that the SPA’s decision was based upon false, misleading or irrelevant information. 
     
      
    95 Ground 2 contends that the SPA’s request that the Applicant undergo a full psychological report prior to the next hearing indicated that no proper consideration was given to the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard and that the SPA did not have sufficient cause to refuse parole. It is contended, inferentially, that false, misleading and irrelevant information was taken into account. The ground, in a sense, restates grounds which I have already determined.  
     
      
    96 In my view, that was no fundamental inconsistency in the SPA refusing the Applicant parole in the face of the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard. It was open to the SPA to conclude that those reports did not constitute a foundation for the requisite degree of satisfaction under s.135(1), after taking into account the factors set out in s.135(2) and s.135A CAS Act. It seems clear from the SPA’s decision that it was not prepared to accept, for the purposes of its statutory function, that Dr Nielssen’s single paragraph concerning the risk of reoffending was determinative of the Applicant’s parole application. In my view, the matters complained of in Ground 2 do not demonstrate that the decision of the SPA took into account false, misleading or irrelevant material for the purposes of s.155(1) CAS Act. 
     
      
    97 Ground 3 contends that the Applicant’s refusal to undertake the CUBIT program did not give the SPA sufficient cause to refuse parole and that this approach indicates that false, misleading and irrelevant material was taken into account. In my view, it was clearly relevant to the SPA’s determination that the Applicant had refused to apply for the CUBIT program despite recommendations having been made that he should do so. Some of the authorities which I have cited from other jurisdictions support this approach. The SPA, of course, was bound to approach the Applicant’s case upon the basis that he was a repeat sex offender. It was a matter for the SPA to determine, on all the information before it (which included the Applicant’s refusal to apply for the CUBIT program), whether it was satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that parole ought be granted to the Applicant under s.135(1) CAS Act.  
     
      
    98 In my view, it was open to the SPA to form the conclusion that parole ought be refused. I am not satisfied that the decision of the SPA took into account information that was false, misleading or irrelevant for the purpose of s.155(1) in the manner alleged in Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    99 An application under s.155 CAS Act is, as the Court of Criminal Appeal has acknowledged, a limited form of review. The heads of argument which might be available on an application for prerogative relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 are wider than the available grounds under s.155(1). In drawing this comparison, it should not be taken that I am indicating that any basis for relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 would have been available in this case.  
     
      
    100 It is clear that the SPA is called upon to make difficult decisions involving the balancing of a number of factors arising under ss.135 and 135A CAS Act, where some of these factors may point in different directions. In McCallum v Parole Board, it was observed at paragraph 30 that the question of granting parole is usually one of considerable difficulty when the offender maintains his innocence and the crime committed is one which evinces matters which need to be addressed before the offender is released on parole. 
     
      
    101 The 2004 amendments to the CAS Act appear to have emphasised the importance of the protection of the public and the risk of reoffending in making a parole decision. No doubt, the SPA will bear in mind that, where an offender is not released on parole but serves his entire sentence, he will be released into the community without supervision.  
     
      
    102 It is true, as the Applicant pointed out in his submission to the SPA, that upon release, he will be subject to the provisions of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000. That Act imposes registration and reporting requirements for offenders who commit sexual offences against children. However, the requirements of that Act are significantly different to those arising from conditional release on parole as the final component of serving a sentence of imprisonment. 
     
      
    103 I am not satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated any basis for a direction to be given under s.155(1) CAS Act. 
     
      
    104 The application is dismissed.

     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.2 HOEBEN J: I agree with Johnson J.3 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Shadi Chahine, appeals against conviction upon a charge of aggravated robbery under s.95(1) Crimes Act 1900. The Appellant stood trial in the Sydney District Court before Phegan DCJ and a jury between 2 and 8 November 2004. On the lastmentioned date, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.4 On 24 June 2005, Phegan DCJ sentenced the Appellant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and 10 months commencing on 21 December 2003 and expiring on 20 October 2006 with a balance of term of one year and two months to expire on 20 December 2007. Accordingly, the Appellant was sentenced to an effective term of four years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and 10 months.5 The present appeal relates to conviction only. No challenge has been made to the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing Judge.  
     
      
      Certificate under s.5(1)(b)  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      
    6 After sentence was imposed on the Appellant on 24 June 2005, counsel then appearing for him made an application to Phegan DCJ for a “certificate of appeal” (ROS21-22). No grounds were formulated at that time for inclusion in a certificate. The Crown representative indicated that the Crown did not wish to be heard on the matter. Phegan DCJ granted a certificate. 7 When the appeal was called on before this Court on 13 April 2006, Mr Hamill SC, for the Appellant, informed the Court that a certificate had not been provided by his Honour although it was said that a draft had recently been provided to him.8 Section 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “5  
        Right of appeal in criminal cases 
         
         
        (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court: 
         
         
          
          (a) against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and 
           
           
          (b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person’s conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, and 
           
           
          (c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction. …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Where a certificate is granted by the trial judge under s.5(1)(b) of the Act, it has the consequence that an appellant may appeal against conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed fact and law without the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 10 In R v G (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 February 1992, BC9203055), Campbell J (Gleeson CJ and Kirby P agreeing) at page 29 observed that it was inappropriate for a s.5(1)(b) certificate to be granted unless there is some matter of substance to be raised. His Honour observed that a risk of injustice does not arise from the refusal of a certificate because application can always be made to this Court for leave to appeal. 11 It does not appear from the transcript in the present case that grounds of appeal were articulated before Phegan DCJ to allow his Honour to decide whether a s.5(1)(b) certificate should be issued. The provision is based upon the premise that grounds will be identified for this purpose. Where defence counsel intends to apply to a trial judge for a s.5(1)(b) certificate, it is appropriate that counsel be in a position to identify, preferably in writing, the grounds sought to be included in the certificate. That did not occur in this case. The failure to follow such a procedure appears to have resulted in the unsatisfactory position that no certificate has in fact been issued by the trial judge which can be placed before this Court.12 In circumstances where the Crown did not seek to be heard before Phegan DCJ on the application for a certificate, the Court took the view at the hearing of the present appeal that the Appellant ought be granted leave by this Court under s.5(1)(b) to rely upon the grounds contained in his Notice of Appeal.  
     
      
      Grounds of Appeal 
      
    13 The Appellant relies upon four grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      (1) The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
       
      (2) The learned trial Judge erred in upholding an objection which denied counsel for the accused the opportunity to explore the question of whether, and how, the man nominated by the victim could be excluded as being the perpetrator of the crime. 
       
       
      (3) The learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the failure of the prosecution to call the man nominated by the victim was, in the absence of any explanation, a matter properly to be taken into account in assessing the prosecution case. 
       
       
      (4) The learned trial Judge misdirected the jury as to the onus and standard of proof. 
      
    14 The Appellant was granted leave, at the hearing of the appeal, to rely upon Ground 4. 
     
      
      The Offence Charged 
      
    15 The Appellant stood trial upon an indictment alleging that, on 5 August 2003, at Randwick in the State of New South Wales, he did rob Neil Nicholson of certain property, to wit a quantity of surveillance tapes and one safe containing a quantity of Australian currency, and at the time of robbery used corporal violence on Neil Nicholson. 
     
      
      The Evidence at Trial 
      
    16 It was not disputed at the trial that, at about 3.10 am on 5 August 2003, the victim, Mr Nicholson, was robbed by two men whilst working as a parking attendant at the car park at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick. The issue at the trial was whether the Appellant was one of the two robbers. 17 A co-accused, Ali Saleh, pleaded guilty to the charge on 1 November 2004. Mr Saleh did not give evidence at the Appellant’s trial. In due course, Mr Saleh was sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and 10 months commencing on 22 October 2004 and expiring on 21 August 2006 with a balance of term of one year and five months expiring on 21 January 2008. Mr Saleh’s effective sentence was one of imprisonment for three years and three months with a non-parole period of one year and 10 months.18 It was the evidence of Mr Nicholson that at about 3.10 am on 5 August 2003, a man came to the inquiry window at the car park office and asked if there was a toilet nearby. The Crown alleged that this man was the Appellant. Mr Nicholson directed the man to the lifts, having told him that he needed to go to the reception area of the hospital. Mr Nicholson heard a noise behind him and he turned and saw a second man half-way through the office window.19 Mr Nicholson described the first man as being five foot seven or eight inches tall with a stocky build, of Mediterranean, Greek appearance with short crew-cut hair and aged 20 to 25 years old. He had a heavy growth of hair on the lower part of his face which Mr Nicholson described as “like stubble” as though he had not shaved for the day. He did not have a beard or moustache (T4, 2 November 2004). 20 It was accepted at trial that the Appellant was five foot five inches or 162.5 cm tall (T201). 21 Mr Nicholson described the second man as being about six feet tall, slim, Mediterranean appearance with crew-cut hair and very dark stubble (T6, 2 November 2004). It was the Crown case that Mr Saleh was the second man.22 Mr Nicholson moved towards the second man who had come through the inquiry window and knocked him back. Mr Nicholson grabbed the second man and the first man came from behind and grabbed Mr Nicholson and pulled him back. A struggle ensued between Mr Nicholson and the two men and they forced him to the ground in the office area. The first man grabbed his legs and held him down and the second man got down on top of his chest and punched him in the face several times. The first man threw a few punches as well (T7-8, 2 November 2004). 23 By this time, Mr Nicholson realised that he had no choice. He told the men that he gave up and that they could do what they wanted. The second man continued to hit Mr Nicholson around the face and mouth, but then stopped and taped up his wrists and legs with silver masking tape (T8, 2 November 2004). Mr Nicholson was then dragged along the ground into the kitchen area of the office.24 The first man went into the manager’s office where the safes were kept. The second man went into the main office where the till and video recorders were located. Mr Nicholson heard banging and one of the men said “I found it”. The second man went into the manager’s office, and Mr Nicholson heard more banging. He came out a short time later with one of the video tapes in his hand. This man left the office and Mr Nicholson heard the sound of a motor vehicle. He saw the first man pushing the safe along the ground towards the exit door. The first man told the second man “give me a hand”. Mr Nicholson caught a glimpse of the motor vehicle which he described as a white old-model vehicle.25 Mr Nicholson loosened his bonds and called the police and security. He said that about 15 to 20 minutes had passed between the time when he spoke to the first man and the time when he rang the police (T10, 2 November 2004). The white car left the hospital car park heading in the direction of Barker Street, Randwick. 26 At about 4.10 am on 5 August 2003, Tracy Stokes observed a white 1978 Toyota Celica VAW 849 parked on the eastern side of Harbourne Road, Kingsford with the driver-side wheels up on the gutter. The vehicle had crashed into the rear-driver’s door of a white van. The motor was still running, the headlights were on and the driver’s side door was open. This spot was about 1.5 kilometres from the scene of the robbery at the Prince of Wales Hospital car park. A large safe was sitting on the front-passenger’s seat. A video tape was on the floor. These were the safe and video tape which had been stolen from the Prince of Wales Hospital car park area earlier that morning. 27 The office area of the car park and the white Toyota Celica motor vehicle were subjected to thorough fingerprint examination. A fingerprint of the Appellant’s left index finger was found on the interior front left of the inquiry window in the car park office on the right frame of the sliding glass window. This fingerprint was approximately 80 cms from the base of the window and about 1.76 metres from the floor (T109, 185-186). A fingerprint of the Appellant’s left middle finger was found on the exterior of the front-passenger door of the Toyota Celica motor vehicle (T101, 111-112, 125, 129). The fingerprints of Mr Saleh were found on the interior and exterior of the Toyota Celica motor vehicle and on a cigarette packet and a tape bundle located inside the vehicle (T102, 129).28 At trial, there was no dispute that the Appellant’s fingerprints had been located inside the office window and on the exterior of the Toyota Celica motor vehicle. The location of the Appellant’s fingerprints in these two different places, comprising the crime scene and the getaway vehicle, provided the foundation for the Crown case against the Appellant.29 On 12 September 2003, Mr Nicholson attended Maroubra Police Station and looked at photographs of 12 men. The Appellant, who had been arrested on 4 September 2003, was depicted in photograph 9. Mr Nicholson told Detective Leading Senior Constable Woodward that the man depicted in photograph 12 was the person who had come to the inquiry window in the car park. He said that the men depicted in photographs 1 and 8 had similar features, namely, their eyes and the shape of their faces and noses. Mr Nicholson was asked by Detective Woodward which photographs he considered were definitely not similar to the offenders and Mr Nicholson indicated photographs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 (T14-15).30 At trial, counsel for the Appellant (who did not appear on the appeal), placed heavy emphasis upon Mr Nicholson’s photographic identification of another person on 12 September 2003 and his exclusion of the photograph of the Appellant at that time.31 Mr James Ali was called in the Crown case, apparently at the request of the Appellant’s legal representatives. Mr Ali worked as a parking attendant at the Prince of Wales Hospital. Mr Ali’s evidence fluctuated in the course of examination in chief, cross-examination and re-examination. The Appellant’s trial counsel cross-examined him in an effort to confirm that Mr Ali had seen the Appellant on an earlier occasion or occasions in the Prince of Wales Hospital car park and in the vicinity of the window near the inquiry office. Further reference will be made to Mr Ali’s evidence later in this judgment. 32 The Appellant did not give evidence and no witness was called in the defence case. 33 Although a number of other witnesses were called in the Crown case, it is not presently necessary to refer to their evidence. Put shortly, the Crown submitted to the jury that the circumstantial evidence in the form of two fingerprints of the Appellant in two different places associated with the crime was such as to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence and ought lead the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant’s guilt. The Crown submitted that the jury would be satisfied that Mr Nicholson was mistaken in his identification of the man in photograph 12 and his exclusion of the Appellant in photograph 9. In this regard, the Crown invited the jury to examine the 12 photographs viewed by Mr Nicholson on 12 September 2003 and, in particular, photographs 9 and 12. The Crown submitted that there were clear similarities in the features of the persons depicted in photographs 9 and 12. The Crown submitted that the general description provided by Mr Nicholson of the first man was consistent with the description of the Appellant. 34 Trial counsel for the Appellant submitted that the jury would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant. Heavy reliance was placed upon Mr Nicholson’s identification of the man in photograph 12 and the exclusion of the Appellant in photograph 9. It was submitted that the evidence of Mr Ali left open the reasonable possibility that the Appellant had been in the vicinity of the inquiry office window, and thus an innocent explanation may be available for the fingerprint located inside that window. It was submitted that an innocent explanation may be readily available for the location of the Appellant’s fingerprint on the exterior of the Toyota Celica motor vehicle. It was emphasised that no fingerprints of the Appellant had been identified inside the vehicle nor inside the office area of the car park. 
     
      
      The Grounds of Appeal 
      
    35 I propose to consider Grounds 2, 3 and 4 and then return to Ground 1. 
     
      
      Ground 2 - Cross-Examination of Detective Woodward 
      
    36 During the cross-examination of the officer-in-charge, Detective Woodward, the following exchange occurred (T194-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The man who was selected by Mr Nicholson in photograph number 12 his name was Mustapha Jebara, is that right. J E B A R A? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. That man, I think you have told us, was at liberty at the time? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And so it would it  
        (sic) 
         be fair to say from that, that the police would have absolutely no idea where he was at the time this crime was committed? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And he can’t be, therefore, he can’t can  
        (sic) 
         excluded as the person who possibly committed this crime. Would you agree with that? 
         
        A. I have excluded him from the crime. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. Sorry? 
         
        A. I have excluded him from the crime. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. In your mind, you have made up your mind who has committed the crime, no doubt, is that right? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        OBJECTION 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: What my learned friend is trying to do here is usurp the functions of the Court in making a determination in this. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        COUNSEL: I agree, I didn’t expect the answer, let me rephrase it. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        COUNSEL: Q. As far as all your investigation is concerned in relation to that man, Mr Jebara, you can not positively exclude him from being the offender at that crime. Do you agree with that? 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        OBJECTION 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That is precisely my objection. That is what we are asking this Court to do, not the police officer. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        COUNSEL: I’m not asking, with all due respect to the Crown, that is not what I am doing. I am not asking this officer to say, ‘Man number 12 did it’. All I am asking is, is he able to exclude him by the normal means, such as the Crown is able to say that person was in gaol. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I think we might have to sort this out in the absence of the jury.” 
        
       
      
    37 Counsel made submissions on the objection in the absence of the jury. Phegan DCJ then gave the following ruling in the absence of the jury (T196.38): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: That all follows from the answer to the question that his whereabouts remain unknown. That is all implicit in that evidence. Obviously there is no evidence he was at a party or anywhere else at the time. We simply don’t know. Well, the police don’t know. And therefore the jury has no source of information about where he was; except they know he wasn’t in custody. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Well, that is fine. But to probe further, it seems to me, is an exercise in the evaluation of the thoroughness of the police investigation, which as such has got nothing to do with these proceedings, and certainly nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the accused. I simply cannot see where this can legitimately take the evidence, except to start to run hares in the mind of jury that they ought not to have to grapple with.” 
        
       
      
    38 Immediately upon the return of the jury, his Honour gave the following direction (T199.3): 
     
      
       
        
        ‘HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, can I just first of all take up the matter that was raised from the bar table just before you retired for what turned out to be your morning tea break. You will remember that there was some questions put about the person who was in photograph number 12 of Exhibit D who was identified by Mr Nicholson and evidence was given that at the time he was as far as the police knew at liberty and although his whereabouts were not known. All I want to say is that is as far as the evidence in so far as it is relevant to these proceedings should be taken, so you could simply disregard any further exchange that took place about that particular matter beyond that point.” 
        
       
      
     Submissions39 Mr Hamill SC submitted that the learned trial Judge erred in disallowing cross-examination of the police officer relevant to the possibility that another man had committed the crime. It was submitted that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the identification by Mr Nicholson was wrong and that the evidence excluded the possibility that the man identified by him was the true perpetrator. It was submitted that once the police officer had ventured his own opinion that he had “excluded [Jebara] from the crime”, considerations of fairness required that the cross-examiner be permitted to test the basis of that evidence. It was submitted that the jury may have been left with the perhaps erroneous impression that the police had evidence or information which logically excluded Mr Jebara as being present at the time of the robbery. 40 The Crown submitted that the trial Judge did not err in upholding the objection relevant to this ground. It was submitted that his Honour’s conclusion that the line of questioning was not relevant was clearly correct. If allowed, the line of questioning would achieve no more than to elicit inadmissible opinion evidence and, accordingly, the evidence was properly disallowed. The Crown submitted that there was no other evidence linking the man in photograph 12 (Mr Jebara) with the robbery other than Mr Nicholson’s photographic identification. The evidence before the jury was that Mr Jebara was not in custody at the time of the robbery and his whereabouts were unknown. Had his Honour allowed the line of questioning, the Crown submitted that the answers may have been detrimental to the Appellant’s case. 
     
      
      Decision 
      
    41 It was open to trial defence counsel to explore in cross-examination of the officer-in-charge the whereabouts of Mr Jebara at the time of the robbery. Evidence was before the jury that Mr Jebara was not in custody at the time of the robbery and that police did not know his whereabouts at that time. In answer to a direct question in cross-examination as to whether he had been excluded by Detective Woodward as the offender, the witness answered that he had indeed been excluded. Thereafter, following submissions in the absence of the jury, his Honour disallowed further cross-examination on this topic but proceeded to direct the jury to pay no regard to evidence concerning Mr Jebara except that which indicated that he was not in custody at the time of the robbery and that police were unaware of his whereabouts at the time. This was a favourable direction for the Appellant. It is difficult to see, upon any rational analysis, how cross-examination of Detective Woodward could have advanced the Appellant’s case. Rather, a favourable direction was given by the trial judge.42 The Crown Prosecutor did not refer to this issue during her closing address. Trial defence counsel said the following to the jury (T236.44): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the Crown has got gone  
        (sic) 
         to quite a bit of effort to dampen the person number 12. Well, to us, the defence, it doesn’t really matter. We are not standing here saying to you, Number 12 the Man, Nicholson got it right. He is out at large, he is at liberty nobody knew where he was. He did it. I am not standing here saying that at all. Maybe he did. We don’t know. What I am relying upon as far as Mr Nicholson’s evidence is, is how he excluded Mr Chahine.” 
        
       
      
    43 Phegan DCJ did not touch upon this evidence in the summing up nor was any application made for a further direction dealing with this issue. 44 In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the trial judge fell into error in rejecting the question asked by defence counsel. The evidence which had been given concerning Mr Jebara’s whereabouts at the time of the robbery favoured the Appellant. His Honour’s direction to the jury also favoured the Appellant. The issue did not loom again in the trial. I am not satisfied that any unfairness to the Appellant resulted. I reject Ground 3. 
     
      
      Ground 3 - Failure to Give a  
      Jones v Dunkel  
      Direction 
      
     Submissions45 The Crown did not call Mr Jebara as a witness at the trial. Mr Hamill SC submitted that the failure of the Crown to call Mr Jebara as a witness ought to have resulted in the trial judge giving special directions to the jury as to the forensic implications of that failure. In particular, it was submitted that the jury was entitled more readily to draw innocent inferences (favourable to the Appellant) from all of the evidence in view of the failure of the Crown to call the man nominated by Mr Nicholson as playing the role in the robbery which it sought to attribute to the Appellant.46 Mr Hamill SC referred to the history and scope of directions emanating from the rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 and referred the Court to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285. He acknowledged the following statement of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers at 291 [6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, as a general rule, a trial judge should not direct the jury in a criminal trial that the prosecution would be expected to have called persons to give evidence other than those it did call as witnesses. It follows that, as a general rule, the judge should not direct the jury that they are entitled to infer that the evidence of those who were not called would not have assisted the prosecution. A direction not to speculate about what the person might have said should be given. Again, exceptions to these general rules will be rare and will arise only in cases where it is shown that the prosecution's failure to call the person in question was in breach of the prosecution's duty to call all material witnesses.” 
        
       
      
    47 Mr Hamill SC submitted that, in the present case, given that Mr Nicholson had identified a named person whose whereabouts at the time of the offence were unknown, then that person was a witness to whom the rule in Jones v Dunkel applied. He did not suggest that the Crown had breached any duty by failing to call Mr Jebara and he acknowledged that there was no cross-examination (or other evidence) as to why Mr Jebara was not called at the trial. He submitted, however, that in the peculiar circumstances whereby Mr Jebara’s photograph had been nominated by Mr Nicholson, and in view of the requirement that the prosecution exclude the possibility that it was Mr Jebara, and not the Appellant, who committed the crime, the failure to call him was a matter properly to be taken into account in assessing whether the prosecution had excluded all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence.48 The Crown emphasised that no direction had been sought from the trial judge. Leave pursuant to Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules was required to argue this ground. As the Appellant did not contend that the Crown had breached a duty to call Mr Jebara to give evidence, it was submitted that the observations of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers, above, were apposite. As there was no cross-examination on the issue, there was no evidence before the trial court to lay the foundation for such a direction: Aslett v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 49 at paragraph 66. The Crown submitted that leave to argue this ground ought be refused. 
     
      
      Decision 
      
    49 Critical to the resolution of this ground is the failure of trial defence counsel to seek a Jones v Dunkel direction from the trial judge with respect to Mr Jebara. It is not surprising that no such direction was sought in this case. No witness had been cross-examined so as to raise this issue. Counsel did not address the jury in a way that invited any inference to be drawn adverse to the Crown case, or favourable to the Appellant, arising from the Crown’s failure to call Mr Jebara as a witness. The observations of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers provide a further difficulty, in principle, for the Appellant seeking such a direction. I do not consider that the trial judge has erred in this case in not giving a Jones v Dunkel direction. In my view, leave to argue this ground under Rule 4 ought be refused. 
     
      
      Ground 4 - The Onus and Standard of Proof Ground 
      
    50 At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Hamill SC was granted leave to add a further ground of appeal. He submitted that the learned trial judge, in one area, misdirected the jury as to the onus and standard of proof. 51 In the course of the summing up, his Honour directed the jury in orthodox terms that the prosecution bore the onus of proof and that the standard of proof was beyond reasonable doubt (SU7-8, 11). Later, his Honour directed the jury (SU19): 
     
      
       
        
        “You may still, and it is a matter for you, be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the only explanation for those two fingerprints being found in the position and applied in the manner in which on the police evidence they were applied in is that they were put there on the morning of the robbery by the accused. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        But you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt because it is absolutely central to the question of whether the accused was the person involved in the robbery. And if the effect of Mr Ali’s evidence is to raise that reasonable doubt and to create in your mind a doubt of a reasonable kind then you should, indeed you must, find the accused not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    52 Mr Hamill SC referred to an earlier direction given with respect to the evidence of Mr Ali (SU16-17): 
     
      
       
        
        “Let me suppose, just for the sake of guiding you, that you do find that Mr Ali never recognised the accused and to the extent that he suggested to the contrary it was part of a somewhat confused presentation in the witness box. The accused’s identity was never more, that is, identity with a person he had spoken to on earlier occasions, was never more than a mere possibility. If that is the conclusion you draw then Mr Ali’s evidence is not really of very much assistance. It does not take that aspect of the case beyond the realms of speculation. Did he or did he not see the accused before? It is very difficult to tell on that approach to his evidence whether he did or he did not.” 
        
       
      
    53 After the jury retired to consider its verdict, trial defence counsel sought a further direction with respect to Mr Ali’s evidence (SU30-32). In the absence of the jury, discussion ensued between the trial judge and counsel concerning possible further directions. His Honour said to trial defence counsel (SU32): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: It’s difficult because how do they come to a decision it was reasonably possible unless they accept his evidence of recognition. If they reject his evidence of recognition, if they say, we don’t accept him when he said he was there before, I remember his face, but all he said was, as he said without exaggeration say at least ten times, it is possible and that’s as far as they read his evidence then - I can only repeat what I said, it doesn’t say anymore than anyone else could say and I don’t think that you can get the mileage out of the possibility, even reasonable possibility. I suppose you can argue it’s a reasonable possibility that - it is a reasonable possibility the accused, was there before. He lives in the Sydney area, there might’ve been any number of reasons he’s been at Prince of Wales Hospital, so I suppose it’s a reasonable possibility. But what they have to be satisfied is on the balance of probabilities Mr Ali saw him otherwise it is of - now I have no difficulty if this would assist, I have no difficulty because I didn’t say this, that when I referred to their accepting his evidence that he’d seen on at least one occasion the accused at that location and spoken to him, that they only have to be satisfied of that on the balance of probabilities that there is no reverse onus of proof on the accused. I have no problem with that. In fact it reminds me that perhaps - well I don’t think there’d be any doubt in the jury’s mind but it would be an opportunity for me to remind them that the accused doesn’t have to prove anything and I’ll say that. But that in terms of Mr Ali’s evidence if the version is of most assistance to the accused is to be accepted, then they have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that that was in fact the case. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        COUNSEL: I’d be happy with that your Honour. That’d sort it, thank you very much. And that’s all, thank you your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    54 Accordingly, trial defence counsel expressed satisfaction with the proposed direction to the trial judge.55 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that no further direction was required and that such a direction may confuse the issue (SU33): 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, in relation to the other matter, I would simply submit that your Honour has already properly and fairly put that matter at great length before the jury and to say anything more at this stage may only confuse the issue. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I hope I’m capable of not doing that. I accept broadly what you say, but if I put it in the context of reminding them, as I should have, that in general terms the accused bears no onus on the evidence, and that when I referred to this particular example it’s a matter that they are required to be satisfied only on the balance of probabilities. I doubt whether that will cause any confusion and it won’t, I don’t think, unfairly slant the evidence in any direction that it shouldn’t, which is why I baulked at what  
        [defence counsel]  
        was pressing me to say beyond that. If I put it in the context that I’ve said it before but I should have said it again that the accused bears no onus of proof, the fact that he did not give any evidence or call any evidence is not to be used against him, and in the context of specific aspects of the evidence, such as this, to the extent that the jury needs to be satisfied on a matter in the accused’s interests, it’s only on the balance of probabilities.” 
        
       
      
    56 Accordingly, the trial judge rejected the Crown submission that such a direction ought not be given. Defence counsel did not make any further submission to the trial judge on this issue. 57 As a result of these submissions, his Honour gave the following further direction to the jury (SU45): 
     
      
       
        
        “I just wanted to remind you of that and relate that to something else I said in this context about Mr Ali’s evidence. The evidence of Mr Ali about which there was much debate and about which you were urged to come to different conclusions by counsel, namely whether or not he recognised the accused from earlier occasions. That is a matter, if you are to be satisfied one way or the other, is a matter on which you need to be satisfied only on the balance of probabilities. In other words the burden beyond reasonable doubt which the Crown bears to prove the case against the accused does not apply to an individual piece of evidence such as that where you are simply deciding what to make of what a witness is saying one way or the other and where that conclusion would be, at least potentially, in the accused’s interests. If you were satisfied that Mr Ali had seen the accused before at that location you only need to be satisfied of that on the balance of probabilities and no more. So when I talked about being satisfied or convinced by his evidence I just wanted to be sure you did not take that as meaning convinced beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    58 Defence Counsel did not ask the learned trial judge to withdraw this direction or to give the jury any further direction on this matter. 
     
      
      Submissions 
      
    59 Mr Hamill SC submits that this direction was erroneous because it casts upon the Appellant an onus to establish an alternative hypothesis for the fingerprint on the inside office window on the balance of probabilities. In law, there was no such onus on the Appellant. If the jury on all of the evidence, including the evidence of Mr Ali and the evidence of the particular location of the fingerprint, came to the view that it was possible (or reasonably possible) that the fingerprint on the office window was placed there by the Appellant other than at the time of the robbery, it was submitted that he was entitled to be acquitted. In coming to that view, the jury was bound to take into account the finding of the fingerprint on the outside of the getaway car, but that evidence standing alone was insufficient to establish the case against him.60 Mr Hamill SC acknowledged that leave was required under Rule 4 to argue this ground. He submitted that leave ought be granted given that there could be no tactical advantage to the Appellant in seeking such a direction at the trial. He submitted that trial counsel simply fell into the same error as the learned trial judge in this respect. It was submitted that the misdirection went to the heart of the trial and wrongly cast an onus of proof upon the Appellant.61 The Crown submitted that leave ought not be granted to raise this ground of appeal. The further direction was sought by the Appellant’s trial counsel who expressed satisfaction with it. Even if the direction given was erroneous, the Crown submitted that the Court would be satisfied that no miscarriage of justice had occurred given the cogency of the fingerprint evidence and the worthlessness of Mr Ali’s evidence.  
     
      
      Decision 
      
    62 In a criminal trial, the onus of proof lies on the prosecution from beginning to end and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt: Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions (1935) AC 462 at 481-482. In the absence of a statutory defence casting a legal onus upon an accused person, the onus of proof never shifts to the accused: R v Youssef (1990) 50 A Crim R 1 at 2. Absent such a defence, it is erroneous to direct a jury that a factual finding which may favour the accused need only be established on the balance of probabilities. Such a direction should play no part in a criminal trial. The accused may point to aspects of the evidence in support of a submission that the Crown cannot remove or eliminate the reasonable possibility that the accused is not guilty: R v Youssef at 2-3; R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385 at paragraph 135. That, however, does not involve a direction that the jury must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities before a fact is found favourable to the accused. 63 In the present case, the trial judge directed the jury, correctly, in his initial instruction concerning the approach to the evidence of Mr Ali. It was only after an application was made by defence counsel that his Honour indicated an intention to introduce the concept of balance of probabilities in a further direction. Defence counsel approved expressly of this direction and asked his Honour to give it. The Crown Prosecutor, correctly, objected to the further direction, but his Honour determined that it ought be given in accordance with the accused’s application. 64 To the extent that the learned trial judge has imported the concept of balance of probabilities into the jury’s fact-finding process, it is erroneous. However, that does not mean that it necessarily follows that the appeal should succeed and the conviction quashed. 65 There is no case for the grant of leave under Rule 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the Appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the Appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at paragraph 74. The requirements of Rule 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non-direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance of counsel to which he or she is entitled in the increasingly difficult task of giving appropriate directions to the jury: R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at 353 [24]. If a summing up contains an error which could easily have been cured once the judge’s attention had been drawn to it, and if the error has caused no miscarriage of justice, it is not appropriate to permit an appellant to seek a new trial on the basis of that error in the hope that he may do better with a different jury. The right to a fair trial operates in favour of both the accused and the Crown which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community: R v Wilson at 353 [24].66 The Appellant placed no reliance in this case upon authorities involving the submission that the conduct of defence counsel at trial was incompetent and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted: TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124; Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614. 67 It is appropriate to consider the evidence of Mr Ali, to which the erroneous direction relates, for the purpose of considering whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case. I have carefully read and re-read the evidence of Mr Ali. It is, to say the least, unsatisfactory in a number of respects.68 The evidence of Mr Ali fluctuated and he demonstrated a tendency to agree, in terms of possibility, with propositions put to him in evidence in chief, cross-examination and re-examination. The flavour of his evidence was that he saw a large number of persons in the course of his duties at the hospital and that it was theoretically possible that he had seen the Appellant before in that context. The tenor of his evidence reflected the concept that this was possible because anything is possible. I do not consider that Mr Ali’s evidence possessed any evidentiary worth. His evidence did not point to a reasonable possibility that the Appellant had been, prior to the robbery, in the vicinity of the office window in the car park or that the Appellant’s hand may have been applied to the interior window of the inquiry office. 69 In my view, Mr Ali’s evidence rose no higher than fanciful supposition or speculation or theoretical possibility that the Appellant may have been in the vicinity of the inquiry office window prior to the robbery. An even greater level of fanciful supposition and speculation would be involved in deriving from Mr Ali’s evidence some possible innocent explanation for the Appellant’s fingerprint being present on the interior surface of the office window. 70 Viewed in this way, Mr Ali’s evidence could rise no higher than a bare possibility or a fanciful supposition or possibility in the sense described by O’Connor J in Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 661-662; R v Youssef at 3-4. Mr Hamill SC submitted that the distinction between a “possibility” and a “reasonable or real possibility” was of little or no moment. He referred to R v Ayoub [2004] NSWCCA 209 at paragraphs 7, 29-31. I do not accept that R v Ayoub supports the proposition that a bare possibility or mere possibility is sufficient for present purposes. The term “reasonable possibility” has been emphasised in the authorities (R v Youssef; Kanaan v R) and this constitutes the appropriate term to measure Mr Ali’s evidence in this case.71 I am not satisfied that the Appellant has lost an opportunity of acquittal as a result of the erroneous direction given. I am not satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence, I am not satisfied that there was a substantial, or any, miscarriage of justice in the case: Weiss v The Queen (2005) 80 ALJR 444; [2005] HCA 81 at paragraphs 41-47.72 In the present case, the trial judge had directed the jury correctly until a defence application was made which led to his Honour directing the jury, over Crown objection, in an erroneous fashion. Not only was there an absence of objection by defence counsel at trial to the direction which is now challenged on appeal, but the direction was given to the jury at the request of defence counsel and over Crown objection. Given the nature of the error, I nevertheless took the view that it was appropriate to examine the evidence of Mr Ali to consider whether a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Having undertaken that analysis, I am satisfied clearly that there was no such miscarriage. Although I would grant leave under Rule 4 to permit the Appellant to advance this ground, I reject the ground of appeal.  
     
      
      Ground 1 - An Unreasonable Verdict? 
      
     Submissions73 Mr Hamill SC submitted that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt on the evidence in this case. He submits that the question for the jury, as it is for this Court, is whether any rational inference existed which could explain the Crown’s circumstantial case based upon the Appellant’s fingerprints at the scene of the crime and on the getaway car. He submits that the circumstantial case lacked probative force and that a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence: Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502-503. He submitted that the Crown had failed to lead any evidence of the participation of the Appellant in the robbery and that the presence of the Appellant’s fingerprints at the scene of the crime and on the getaway car constituted a basis for speculation or surmise only and not a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the only rational hypothesis was that the Appellant was guilty of the crime: R v Zouras [2002] VSCA 182. 74 Mr Hamill SC submits that an inference that a man other than the Appellant was the shorter of the two robbers could not reasonably be excluded and that there is a significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted of this crime. He submits that the following matters of evidence ought to have led the jury to have a reasonable doubt about the Appellant’s guilt: 
     
      
      (a) Mr Nicholson’s evidence that photograph 9, a contemporaneous photograph of the Appellant, was  
      “definitely not similar” 
       to the robber; 
       
       
      (b) Mr Nicholson’s evidence that the person depicted in photograph 12 was the robber or closely resembled the robber; 
       
       
      (c) the failure or inability of the prosecution to exclude the person depicted in photograph 12 as the robber; 
       
       
      (d) Mr Ali’s evidence to the effect that, while working as a parking attendant, he may have seen the Appellant at the hospital in the area where his fingerprint was found; 
       
       
      (e) the fact that the fingerprint was on the exterior of the motor vehicle and that the Appellant’s fingerprints were not found inside the vehicle. 
      
    75 Whatever suspicions were raised by the fingerprint evidence, Mr Hamill SC submitted that each fingerprint was capable of an explanation other than the Appellant’s involvement in the robbery. Reference was made to the evidence of Senior Constable Fishburn (T131-132, 141) that it was possible that the fingerprint on the motor vehicle could have been left by someone walking past and touching the car. Reliance was placed upon Mr Ali’s evidence in support of a possible explanation for the fingerprint at the crime scene.76 Mr Hamill SC emphasised that the two fingerprints were the only items of evidence capable of establishing the Appellant’s involvement in the crime. In light of the other possible explanations for the presence of the fingerprints, the evidence of Mr Nicholson (which was completely at odds with the prosecution theory of the case) and the failure by the Crown to exclude the person in photograph 12, he submitted that the Court would come to the view that the verdict of guilty cannot be supported.77 Mr Hamill SC submitted that Mr Nicholson’s positive identification of another man as the offender required the prosecution to exclude that other man beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution called no evidence capable of excluding him. Mr Jebara was not called to give evidence. The only evidence before the jury was that his photograph was in the array, that he was not in custody at the time of the offence and that the police did not know his whereabouts at the time of the offence.78 Mr Hamill SC submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and ought be set aside.79 The Crown submitted that the present case demonstrated that a circumstantial evidence case may be more reliable than a case based on direct evidence: R v Cable (1947) 47 SR 183 at 184. It was submitted that it was open to the jury to draw the inference beyond reasonable doubt of the Appellant’s guilt from the presence of his fingerprints at both the crime scene and on the getaway car which had been found, within an hour of the robbery, approximately 1.5 kilometres away and still containing the stolen safe and video tape.80 The Crown emphasised the cogency of fingerprint evidence: R v Ingivald (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 April 1989, unreported, pages 10-11).81 It was submitted that there was an ample basis for the jury to reject the identification evidence of Mr Nicholson as being unreliable. The Crown pointed to a number of features of Mr Nicholson’s evidence which indicated its unreliability. These included:  
     
      
      (a) in his description of the first man to approach him, Mr Nicholson said that he did not have a beard or moustache, yet he identified as the offender the man in photograph 12 who appears to have a moustache and a light beard; 
       
       
      (b) when asked if he could identify any distinguishing features upon which he based his identification of the man in photograph 12, Mr Nicholson said  
      “No not really, it was just the general appearance”  
      (T20); 
       
       
      (c) Mr Nicholson identified two other men in photographs 1 and 8 as being similar to the man involved in the robbery on the basis of the  
      “general shape of the face, the fullness of the face, the nose” 
       (T20) and he used almost identical words to describe the man in photograph 12  
      “the roundness of the face, the fullness of the face, the eyes the nose” 
      ; 
       
       
      (d) Mr Nicholson was seriously assaulted by both offenders and had to attend hospital; he was not well for some time afterwards and said in his evidence he was in shock immediately after the robbery; 
       
       
      (e) Mr Nicholson did not attend the police station for the purpose of the identification procedure until about a month after the robbery; 
       
       
      (f) the first description given to police by Mr Nicholson fitted the Appellant and even the description given by Mr Nicholson at trial was consistent with the Appellant’s appearance in a number of respects; 
       
       
      (g) the 12 photographs in Exhibit D display males of very similar appearance and only show facial features, not build nor height; 
       
       
      (h) in re-examination, Mr Nicholson said that he had some doubts about his identification of the man in photograph 12; 
       
       
      (i) the evidence from the officer-in-charge was that there were no fingerprints of the man in photograph 12 located at either the scene or in the car. 
      
    82 The Crown submitted that the jury had the opportunity to observe Mr Nicholson give evidence and, with that advantage, were clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was mistaken in his photograph identification.83 The Crown submitted that the evidence of Mr Ali could not have assisted the jury in their deliberations one way or the other. The uncertainties and variations in the evidence of Mr Ali were emphasised. Further, it was submitted that Mr Ali’s evidence, at its highest, did not support a reasonable possibility that the Appellant had stood in the position at the office window where his fingerprint was found after the robbery. Reference was made to a demonstration by the Appellant’s solicitor depicted in photographs tendered by the defence at trial. The photographs of the solicitor were said to support a defence argument that the Appellant, who was four inches shorter than his solicitor, may have leaned in the same way on the window innocently and thereby left his fingerprint in the position where it was located. The Crown submitted that the posture of the solicitor in the photographs was unnatural and contorted. Far from helping the Appellant, the Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to use this photographic evidence to support the conclusion that the Appellant’s fingerprint was there as a result of him supporting himself as he climbed through the office window in the course of the robbery.84 Although the Appellant bore no onus, there was no evidence from the Appellant before the jury suggesting any innocent explanation for his fingerprints being present on both the inside of the office window and the outside of the getaway car.85 As the evidence did not suggest a reasonably possible innocent explanation for the Appellant’s fingerprint on the office window, it was open to the jury to draw the only reasonable inference available, being that the Appellant’s fingerprints at the scene of the crime and on the getaway car were placed there whilst he committed the crime.86 The Crown submitted that, taking the evidence as a whole, it was open to the jury acting reasonably to reject the reasonable possibility that someone else (Mr Jebara) was the offender described by Mr Nicholson. It was submitted that the jury had the opportunity to view the accused in Court during the trial together with the photographs which had been shown to Mr Nicholson, including the photographs of the accused and Mr Jebara. The jury were in a position to assess Mr Nicholson’s evidence in the context of their own observations, an advantage which this Court does not have.87 The Crown submitted that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy a jury, acting reasonably, of the Appellant’s guilt and that this ground of appeal should be dismissed: R v Chahine [2006] NSWCCA 99 at paragraphs 23-24. 
     
      
      Decision 
      
    88 In approaching this ground of appeal, it is appropriate to bear in mind the advantages which a jury have over this Court in considering a case based on circumstantial evidence. In R v Kaldor (2004) 150 A Crim R 271, Dunford J at 272-3 [2] and Howie J at 293-4 [86] observed that a jury brings to consideration of a circumstantial case the common experience of members of the community comprising men and women from different backgrounds, of different ages and with different experiences in life, who apply to the case their collective knowledge of human affairs and their common sense. These observations are apt to the present case.89 The Crown case was based upon the coincidence of two of the Appellant’s fingerprints being at two different and remote places which were connected with the crime. The first fingerprint was on the office window which was the point of entry of the robbers at the scene of the crime. The second fingerprint was on the outside of the getaway car which was used by the robbers, and apparently abandoned, and was then located less than an hour after the robbery. The jury was entitled, indeed obliged, to have regard to their own experience of human affairs and common sense in considering what flowed from this coincidence. This was not a case based upon the fingerprints of the Appellant being present at a single location, as in R v Zouras. 90 The evidence of Mr Nicholson, on close examination, did not especially assist the Appellant. The photographs which were shown to Mr Nicholson (Exhibit D) have been provided to the Court for the purpose of this appeal. It must be observed that there is more than a passing similarity between the photograph of the Appellant (photograph 9) and the photograph of Mr Jebara (photograph 12). This feature was emphasised in the Crown address to the jury and, in my view, for understandable reasons. The factors pointed to by the Crown provide a substantial basis for the jury rejecting Mr Nicholson’s evidence identifying Mr Jebara and excluding the Appellant. The fragile nature of identification evidence has been recognised and these principles have application even with respect to negative identification: R v Rose (2002) 55 NSWLR 701; Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 at paragraphs 107ff.91 It was clearly open to the jury to form the view that Mr Nicholson, although confident in his identification of Mr Jebara in photograph 12 and in his exclusion of the Appellant in photograph 9, was mistaken.92 As previously stated in this judgment, the evidence of Mr Ali was unclear and confusing. At its highest, it raised a fanciful or theoretical possibility that the Appellant may have been in the vicinity of the office window at some time. It did not point to a reasonably possible innocent explanation for the Appellant’s fingerprint inside the office window. As previously indicated, Mr Ali’s evidence was incapable of pointing to a reasonable possibility which could assist the Appellant. His evidence carried no weight at all. 93 I accept the Crown submission that the pose of the Appellant’s solicitor depicted in the photographs (Exhibit 1) was unnatural and contorted and did not support the Appellant’s case. It provided support for the Crown case.94 The evidence of Senior Constable Fishburn relied upon by the Appellant was that it was possible that a person’s fingerprint could be applied to the exterior of a motor vehicle by way of incidental touching. This evidence did not assist the Appellant. It rose no higher than theoretical possibility. There was no evidence before the jury to suggest a context in which the Appellant may have touched the getaway car innocently and incidentally.95 In R v Cable, Jordan CJ observed at 184 that, in many cases, circumstantial evidence is stronger than direct evidence, which is subject to the fallibility of human observation and recollection. This statement has direct application in the present case. There was no issue that the Appellant’s fingerprints were present in two critical locations. The direct evidence of Mr Nicholson and Mr Ali was highly fallible. 96 The Appellant’s fingerprints were located at the scene of the crime and on the getaway car. As Gleeson CJ observed in R v Ingivald (at page 10), fingerprint evidence is powerful and cogent evidence of identification. The combination of the location of the Appellant’s fingerprints at two distant places located with the crime was powerful circumstantial evidence. It provided a direct link between the Appellant and the crime. There was no reasonable innocent hypothesis arising from the evidence at the trial which could explain the Appellant’s fingerprints at these two locations. Properly understood, the evidence of Mr Nicholson assisted the Crown more than the Appellant. His initial description of the first man to the police was broadly similar to that of the Appellant. The photograph selected by him as being the first man was similar to the photograph of the Appellant. Although Mr Nicholson expressed the opinion that the photograph of the Appellant was not that of the offender, it was clearly open to the jury, on all the evidence, to reject that evidence. The man in photograph 12 and the Appellant are very similar in appearance. It is open to this Court to take the same approach.97 There was a clear prima facie case and, on all the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of this crime: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] 213 CLR 487; R v Chahine at paragraphs 23-25.98 The appeal against conviction ought be dismissed.

      2005/1720 REGINA v Cristian Emil SIMIONESCU 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT – Reasons for verdict 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Cristian Simionescu, is on trial before me, sitting without a jury, for the murder of his father, Emil Simionescu. The deceased met his death in the early evening of 23 June 2004 in the home unit at Roselands where he lived with his wife and his adult daughter. The accused, now aged twenty-seven, was living at the time in a unit at Wiley Park. The deceased died from multiple stab wounds to the chest. He had been decapitated and his head had been placed in a plastic bag on the roof of the garage of the premises. From forensic pathological evidence it appears that the decapitation was after the fatal blows were struck. There were an incised wound and a blunt force wound to his head consistent with having been inflicted before death. There were also a number of post mortem cuts and stab wounds to the eyes, nose and mouth, suggestive of mutilation. 
     
      
    2 There is a strong circumstantial case that the perpetrator was the accused, and the evidence admits of no other conclusion than that he inflicted the fatal wounds with the intention of killing his father. Thus, the elements of murder are established beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, the contrary has not been suggested by Mr Button SC, representing the accused. The only issue is whether he was mentally ill, as the law uses that expression in this context, at the relevant time. 
     
      
    3 On that issue the accused bears the burden of proof, on the balance of probabilities. Adapting the language of the well-known M’Naghten Rules to the present case, the issue is whether, at the time of the killing, the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know that what he was doing was wrong. In the present day, lawyers in this country look to the exposition of that principle by Sir Owen Dixon, in his summing up to the jury in The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182. In relation to Mr Porter, his Honour explained the question in this way (at 189 – 90): 
     
      
       
        
        If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. 
        
       
      
    4 There is more than enough evidence here to establish mental illness in that sense. Indeed, for that reason, senior counsel for the Crown and the accused chose not to address me at the close of the evidence.  
     
      
    5 I received in evidence a large volume of material comprising the Crown brief. Much of that is evidence pointing to the accused as his father’s killer, a matter which, as I have said, is not in dispute. However, some of the statements in it bear upon the accused’s mental state and his background of mental disturbance. Foremost among these is a lengthy statement of his mother, Mrs Gheorghita (Gina) Simionescu. Also in the brief are copies of some letters the accused wrote to his mother after being taken into custody. There is material relating to his contact in recent years with Rozelle Hospital and Canterbury Hospital and, since his incarceration, with Justice Health. Finally, I have the reports of two experienced and respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Bruce Westmore and Dr Stephen Allnutt. Dr Westmore had provided reports to the accused’s legal representatives, while Dr Allnutt was engaged by the Crown. Both of those experts also gave oral evidence. 
     
      
    6 There is no need to summarise this material at any length. The accused’s only sibling is his younger sister. The family migrated to Australia from Romania between 1989 and 1990. Mrs Simionescu’s statement records a history of behavioural problems on the part of the accused from 1994, but from 1998 he began to exhibit behaviour of a bizarre, delusional and sometimes aggressive kind. He expressed paranoid thoughts and developed a pre-occupation with weapons, particularly knives and other cutting instruments, presumably perceived to be necessary for his protection.  
     
      
    7 On occasions Mrs Simionescu had to call the police to attend their home because of his conduct. There were a number of attendances for psychiatric examination at Canterbury Hospital and at Rozelle Hospital, and sometimes he was admitted as an involuntary patient. Over this same period he developed a pattern of drug abuse, and at different times he was diagnosed as suffering from a drug induced psychosis or from schizophrenia. He was prescribed anti-psychotic medication, which was effective at times, but he could not be relied upon to take it consistently. 
     
      
    8 Not surprisingly, his relationship with his family was strained by these developments, and by the time of the killing they were estranged. For a long time his relationship with his father had been poor, as his father had expressed his disapproval of his aberrant behaviour and his drug abuse. As I have said, at the time of the killing he was not living in the family home. This is not to say that he did not attempt to maintain contact with the family, but such contact as there was was marred by abuse and harassment on his part.  
     
      
    9 He was in touch with his mother on the day of the killing, 23 June 2004, and the preceding few days. Indeed, he spent the night of 21 June at the family home. Mrs Simionescu recounted her observations of him over that period in some detail in her statement. It is sufficient to say that she observed him to be very agitated and stressed. On 21 June he told her that he wanted to be admitted to Rozelle Hospital for some “time out.” Unfortunately, although she encouraged him to take that course and, indeed, insisted that he do so, he did not. Whether this tragedy might have been averted if he had we will never know. 
     
      
    10 After his arrest he continued to exhibit psychotic symptoms, and he has been treated from time to time while in custody.  
     
      
    11 Dr Westmore saw the accused in custody in October 2004, and December 2005. Dr Allnutt examined him in April 2006. Both doctors diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia, complicated by long-term substance abuse. However, a difficulty they faced in arriving at a conclusion about the forensic issue of mental illness was that the accused was unwilling or unable to describe to them his actions or his mental state at the time of the killing. Both accepted that he may have been unable to do so because of a well recognised psychological response to such a horrific event. 
     
      
    12 That said, he did describe to Dr Westmore having heard voices in the period leading up to the killing which told him that his parents intended to hospitalise him. Taking into account the history of his mental illness over the years and the nature of the killing itself, Dr Westmore expressed the opinion in a report that his illness deprived him of “his capacity to make reasonable and rational judgments” about his father and “to appreciate the wrongness of his behaviour.”  
     
      
    13 The accused also described to Dr Allnutt his hearing voices over the days leading up to the offence, but he said that the voices told him that his parents intended to kill him so that they could sell his bodily organs. Significantly, in a letter to his mother after he was taken into custody, but long before he saw Dr Allnutt, he effectively accused her of planning to profit from the sale of his organs, saying that he did not “want to be a donor.” The same appears in other documents written by him, and from the clinical notes held by Justice Health it appears that in 2004 he was expressing bizarre thoughts about the sale of organs, albeit in a different context.  
     
      
    14 The accused told Dr Allnutt that he had never had a good relationship with his father and, from what he said, it appeared to the doctor that he had some sense that the killing was wrong. He said that “he did not feel justified in doing what he had done.” This led Dr Allnutt to examine the question of mental illness at the relevant time with some care. Nevertheless, he concluded in his report that the accused “could be found to meet the Porter test, being limited in his capacity to contemplate the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure.” He added that “his delusional beliefs and auditory hallucinations could have overwhelmed his capacity for knowledge of wrongfulness at the time, with recovery after the offence causing a recall bias about his knowledge of wrongfulness at the time.” He wrote that his opinion “would fall on the side of the mental illness defence based on current information.” 
     
      
    15 As I have said, both doctors gave oral evidence. Dr Allnutt, who gave evidence first, adhered to the views he had expressed in his report. He explained that his conclusion was unaffected by the undoubted fact that the accused harboured feelings of resentment against his father because of their relationship over the years, expressing the view that any rational basis for anger directed at his father was overtaken by his psychosis.  
     
      
    16 On the whole of the material before me, I would draw the inference that the killing was the product of mental illness. The accused suffered from schizophrenia of long-standing and, on the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that he killed his father because of delusional beliefs produced by that illness. I am fortified in that view by the nature of the killing. Such resentment as the accused may have felt for his father because of their poor relationship could not possibly explain the unbridled savagery of his attack. Clearly, his ability to judge the wrongfulness of his actions by community standards was compromised in such a way as to meet the test expressed by Sir Owen Dixon in Porter. I might add that, in letters to his mother from prison, he conveyed a cursory apology for what he had done but expressed himself in such a way as to demonstrate that he had no insight into the enormity of his conduct. 
     
      
    17 He is entitled to the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. As a result, he will become a forensic patient for the purpose of the Mental Health Act and will be subject to the procedures set out in chapter 5 of that Act. He will not be able to be released into the community except by order of the Governor, on the recommendation of the Mental Health Review Tribunal: s84 of the Act. The Tribunal may not recommend his release unless it is satisfied that his safety or the safety of any member of the public would not thereby be seriously endangered: s82(4). 
     
      
    18 These reasons have been relatively brief because, as I have said, the resolution of the only issue in the case is clear. Despite their brevity, I do not fail to recognise that Mrs Simionescu and her daughter have lost a loved one in distressing, indeed gruesome, circumstances. To them, and to all who have been affected by the tragic death of Mr Simionescu, I express my sympathy. 
     
      
    19 I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. It is necessary to make an order for his disposition under s39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and I shall consult the parties about the terms of that order.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted, with Richard Bruce Cornwall and others, of conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of cocaine (120 kilograms) an offence against s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The conspiracy was alleged to have occurred between 1 January 2001 and 6 August 2001. 
     
      
    2 The appellant, Cornwall and three others, David Norris, Vincent Francis and David Dicecco were tried before Blackmore DCJ and a jury. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to the appellant and Cornwall but was not able to agree on verdicts in relation to Norris, Francis and Dicecco. The appellant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years.  
     
      
    3 The trial before Blackmore DCJ was the second occasion on which Cornwall and the appellant (as well as Norris, Francis and Dicecco) had stood trial for this offence. The first trial took place in the Supreme Court before Howie J and a jury when there were nine accused. On that occasion the jury returned guilty verdicts in relation to John Lawrence and Guillermo Diez and not guilty verdicts in relation to Daniel McDougall and Dominic Brokenshire but were unable to reach verdicts in relation to the remaining five. 
     
      
    4 The appeal in this matter was heard together with the appeal in the matter of Cornwall. In my reasons for judgment in relation to the Cornwall matter I have related the essential elements of the Crown case. In essence the Crown alleged that the accused were involved in a conspiracy to import cocaine from Columbia on a boat called the “Flaning”. The Australian arm of the venture was alleged to have been organised by Cornwall and John Lawrence. The Crown alleged that the present appellant had been enlisted by Lawrence to assist in the acquisition of a motor vehicle suitable to tow a boat, described as a “Zodiac craft”, and to organise payment for this boat. The Crown alleged that the purpose of enlisting the appellant was to ensure that there was no discernible association between Lawrence and the purchase of the boat and vehicle. 
     
      
    5 The evidence tendered against the appellant consisted of observations of his movements and recordings of various conversations in which he participated. One important conversation occurred on 24 April 2001 at 10.50 am. It was recorded on a listening device placed in a motor vehicle. Lawrence is recorded as saying: “I don’t know what the sales are, and I know the other bloke that’s made a bit of a blue with … drop in the dollar … you know what I mean? … it all depends what I think there might be renegotiations.” Lawrence says: “anyway I’m just, I’m telling you what’s being said and what hasn’t been said, you know like I’ve got my idea of values and fuckin whose valuable and what the fucks … but naturally he’s, they think, even the other bloke, they’re the bosses they said we’re the bosses … I don’t think like that.”  
     
      
    6 Later, the conversation turns to the four-wheel drive. The appellant informs Lawrence that the person that he was trying to call on the telephone was not available. Lawrence indicates that he will go home and pick up a phone “in case we’ve got to give a number.” They later discuss not being able to avoid “short cuts” and Lawrence then (as the Crown alleges) complains of what Cornwall (although he does not use his name) was doing or not doing in the venture. Lawrence says: “What do you think I’m talking to you for? Fuckin I’ve got that much to fuckin do, the bloke’s fuckin … sitting back having meetings … how much to you think he’s getting, everyone … break the cunt that’s just they just pass the buck they big note themselves, I’ll fix that up mate, and pass it on, he said I don’t know these people, I said no you don’t know how to go about it doing things because you think everyone’s a fucking mug.”  
     
      
    7 They talk about registration of a vehicle so that it cannot be traced back to Lawrence. Lawrence then expresses concern that the appellant realises the risk associated with his involvement in the venture. Lawrence says to the appellant: “I just want you to feel comfortable.” The appellant replies: “I always got the fuckin sense to know whether it’s fuckin right or wrong … believe it or not I’ll look at a fuckin situation. If I was sitting on a fuckin jury would I fuckin believe it?” Lawrence says: “It’ll be sweet mate, sweet if you’re not the one doing it.” 
     
      
    8 A further conversation is recorded later that morning. They speak of the purchase of a vehicle when the appellant says “I was gonna say I could ring this fuckin bloke myself and … sound him about a cash price”, “then again it might break up the negotiation”, and “I’ll go down, I can go down and have a look at it.” Lawrence tells the appellant to ring “this bloke”. Lawrence tells the appellant “well, see we’ll pay up to 24” and to find out “what colour it is, if it’s good for towing if it’s got everything.” The appellant tells Lawrence that they should “go and have a look” (at the four-wheel drive) and they discuss the price. They are later recorded discussing mechanical reports and putting the registration in the appellant’s name. During the course of this conversation Lawrence says: “but you know what I’m gonna use it for, so if it comes to the fuckin … .” to which the appellant replies: “I know” and Lawrence then says: “If it comes to a shit fight I’d just go, like if I went under … I could say I borrowed it”, “but I’m, what I’m saying you you’ve got that if you want it.” 
     
      
    9 Later that day the appellant and Lawrence are observed by police leaving a shop called “Inflatable Boats”. They are later recorded discussing a plan to look over the car and make arrangements with the bank to obtain a bank cheque for payment. Further conversations are recorded and observations made of the appellant. On 26 April 2001 the appellant is observed to return to the vehicle having deposited money in the bank. A conversation is recorded between the appellant, Lawrence and McDougall in which the appellant says: “happy days” and “that’s right didn’t even … ID or anything.” The appellant says “That’s what I’m saying, they’ve got about eight fuckin tellers in there didn’t even … all she did was check and see if I had the right numbers … everything only relates … where I get over … .” Discussion ensues about the prospect of the appellant going on vacation and Lawrence indicates that very shortly “you’ll be able to do it in style.” Later the appellant and McDougall hand over $25,000 in cash to Mr Green the vendor of the four-wheel drive vehicle. 
     
      
    10 Further observations are made of the appellant driving a motor vehicle containing Lawrence and McDougall. In particular on 28 April 2001 the appellant is observed by police driving the vehicle. 
     
      
    11 At approximately 1.36 pm on 30 April 2001 the appellant using the name M J Benns deposits $20,000 in cash into the account of Club Yacht Sales at the Westpac Bank at 341 George Street, Sydney. On 1 May at 1.38 pm the appellant, Lawrence and McDougall are observed leaving the appellant’s premises in the four-wheel drive. The appellant is later observed at the counter of the Westpac Bank at 341 George Street, Sydney where he deposited a further amount of $23,000 cash into the account of “Club Yacht Sales”. The Crown alleged that these deposits were made in order to pay for the Zodiac boat intended to be used to pick up the drugs at sea. 
     
      
    12 On 3 May 2001 Lawrence, Brokenshire and McDougall travelled to Melbourne to collect the Zodiac boat which is later deposited at Mark Rowell’s marina at Newport.  
     
      
    13 Recordings are made of conversations between the appellant and Lawrence about the storage of the boat and its rental. The conversations take place after the police have carried out arrests of some of the alleged conspirators. At 2.43 pm on 16 May a conversation is recorded between the appellant and Lawrence. The appellant asked Lawrence: “What’s your plan now then because he, Mark (a reference to Rowell) said, that it’s (the boat) most, most likely be ready at lunch time tomorrow or Friday then … ” The appellant indicates that he would like to have a look at it (presumably a reference to the boat) with him (presumably a reference to Lawrence). Lawrence says that he doesn’t know where it (the boat) is. The appellant tells him that it’s in “Mark’s yard wherever the office is.” Lawrence says “he (presumably a reference to Rowell) doesn’t want me going near the joint.” The appellant asked Lawrence whether “Brock” is going with him. Lawrence indicates that he is and says: “Brock don’t know anything about this, all Brock is, he’s getting the, I just want him there for his knowledge of the boat, the motors the GPS.” 
     
      
    14 On 19 May 2001 Brokenshire and McDougall collect the Zodiac from the marina at Newport. Lawrence waits outside the marina for them. They then meet and take the Zodiac up to Telegraph Point. 
     
      
    15 On 23 May 2001 Diez arranged for another alleged conspirator, Wouter to meet with Lawrence at Lawrence’s unit. Lawrence and Wouter (with some assistance from Brokenshire and Diez as Spanish interpreter for Wouter) discuss suitable rendezvous points to meet the “Flaning”. They eventually decide on a position 129 miles off the coast at Port Macquarie. Recorded conversation from Lawrence’s vehicle between Lawrence and Brokenshire reveal that there was a problem in relation to obtaining the correct charts to work out the rendezvous points. Later that afternoon the four of them (Lawrence, Wouter, Diez and Brokenshire) travel in the four-wheel drive vehicle. A conversation was recorded in the vehicle at about 6.28 pm in which Lawrence said: “just go and pick these other charts up so he’s got ‘em, can go, alright, go home and dump these somewhere to have something to eat, wherever … .”  
     
      
    16 At about this time the vehicle is observed by police pulling up at the appellant’s premises at Aboud Ave. Lawrence was observed to get out. The listening device tape records Lawrence returning to the vehicle about 5 minutes later. It also records the appellant’s voice outside the vehicle apparently bantering with Brokenshire who was at this time inside the vehicle. The police were not in a position to make any observations of Lawrence returning to the vehicle or of the appellant speaking to someone in the vehicle. However, shortly after this, the vehicle was seen parked near a restaurant. The police there observed a number of rolled up charts sticking out of a black sports bag behind the driver’s seat. The Crown case was that these charts had been obtained from the appellant. 
     
      
    17 On 9 August 2001 the appellant participated in a record of interview with the Federal police. During that interview the Crown case was that the appellant down played his contact with Lawrence. It was argued that he also down played his role in the purchase of the four-wheel drive vehicle and, although he admits to signing bank deposit forms in a false name, this only occurs after the police have told him that they know of the deposits.  
     
      
    18 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. However, his record of interview was tendered. During that interview he was played extracts from some of the listening device material on which his voice was recorded. In one of the extracts Lawrence, who was in conversation with the appellant is heard to mention “Brocky.” The Crown case is that this is an expression short for Brokenshire. As I have indicated the listening device material tendered at the trial demonstrates that the name “Brocky” was mentioned on a number of occasions when Lawrence and the appellant were in conversation. However, when the listening device material was played to the appellant by the police during the interview, the appellant said in relation to the name “Brocky”: “what’s that, broccoli?” The appellant denied knowing or hearing of “any Brock.” 
     
      
    19 There was no dispute at the trial that the appellant had assisted Lawrence to purchase the boat and the vehicle in a way that would conceal Lawrence’s involvement. It was also accepted that the appellant would have appreciated the possibility that Lawrence intended to use the boat for some “dodgy purpose.” The defence case was that the appellant did not know that the boat was intended to be used in connection with importing drugs into Australia. He says that he was doing a favour for Lawrence but did not understand that anything he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 There are two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground One – The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury regarding evidence relied upon by the Crown as evidence of the appellant’s consciousness of guilt 
       
      
    21 In his final address the Crown prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the accused Bolus there is a record of interview. Again, it’s only admissible as against him. And things that we point out, we suggest that during the course of that interview Bolus is in effect fishing for information from the police as to what they know before he actually says anything. You need to just listen to that. But that’s what we suggest is happening. And you may recall some of those comments that he made in relation to the matters that were played to him, such as when there’s a reference to ‘Brocky’ in one of the listening device tapes that was played to him, he says: ‘Oh, what’s this, broccoli?’, or something along those lines. And again we suggest to you that he knew full well what the name Brocky was when mentioned, but was not saying it to the police when he was being questioned, which we suggest is indicative of what lawyers sometimes call consciousness of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    22 It was submitted in the appeal that the jury would have understood from this submission that they were being invited to infer from aspects of the interview that the appellant knew that he was guilty of being involved in the attempt to import drugs into Australia and answered questions in a way designed to avoid implication in the conspiracy. The reference to “consciousness of guilt” should be understood as applying not only to the reference to “Brocky” but also to other parts of his interview, in particular to the way in which the appellant was “fishing for information.”  
     
      
    23 With regard to the reference to “Brocky” it was submitted that the jury would have understood that the Crown Prosecutor was arguing that the appellant was telling lies to the police about his lack of knowledge of the name “Brocky” because he knew that such knowledge linked him to the attempted drug importation. With respect to the reference to “fishing for information” it was submitted that the jury would have understood that the Crown Prosecutor was arguing that the appellant, aware that he had been involved in the attempted drug importation, was trying to find out what the police knew and what evidence they had against him before he actually gave his version of events. 
     
      
    24 In summing up the trial judge referred to the record of interview and said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Both the Crown and the accused rely upon parts of what he said in the interview. Ultimately, what you make of it, if anything, is completely a matter for you. The Crown says, in effect, that you would find that Bolus moved ground constantly in the interview and was only forthcoming about matters when he knew what the police had learned as they provided him with information whilst they were asking him questions. In effect, the Crown says that Mr Bolus was fishing for information in the course of the interview. … What, if anything, it reveals by the answers given by Bolus or the way he answered particular questions is completely a matter for you.” 
        
       
      
    25 It was submitted by the appellant that having regard to the remarks made by the prosecutor, the directions given by the trial judge were inadequate. Although criticism could be made of the responses which the appellant made during the interview, which may not have required particular directions from his Honour, because the prosecutor invited the jury to infer consciousness of guilt from aspects of the interview, including the alleged lie in relation to “Brock”, the jury should have been directed as to the caution they should exercise before inferring the appellant was conscious of his guilt of the crimes charged: Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193; Hugo (2000) 113 A Crim R 484 at 497; R v Sievers [2004] 151 A Crim R 426 at 433-436. 
     
      
    26 In particular it was submitted that the jury should have been directed that they could not use the alleged lie by the appellant regarding Brock as evidence of guilt unless they were satisfied of the matters referred to in Edwards and R v Ambrosi [2004] 144 A Crim R 67 at 83-85. 
     
      
    27 In relation to reliance on the appellant “fishing for information” it was submitted that if there was any doubt about how the Crown was relying on it, this should have been clarified in the absence of the jury (Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [17]). If relied upon as consciousness of guilt careful directions were necessary: see R v Nguyen (2001) 118 A Crim R 479 at pars 18-20, 88-99; R v Chang (2003) 140 A Crim R 573 at pars 40-48). 
     
      
    28 It was submitted that the jury would have to have been directed that they must not use the alleged conduct of the appellant as evidence of guilt unless they were satisfied that the appellant was indeed “fishing for information”, they were satisfied that there was no other explanation consistent with innocence for it and satisfied that the appellant only engaged in the conduct because he knew, by providing the answers before he found out what the police already knew, he may implicate himself in the offences charged. It was submitted that they should also have been directed that the conduct relied upon by the prosecution could stem from reasons other than the realisation by the appellant of his guilt of the crimes charged, such as fear of wrongful conviction. They should have been directed that, even if satisfied that the conduct of the appellant arose from feelings of guilt, they must be satisfied that it did not arise from guilt over his assisting Lawrence whilst aware that Lawrence was engaged in some kind of criminal enterprise which may not have involved drug importation. 
     
      
    29 The matter was not raised at the trial and leave under Rule 4 is required. It was submitted that there were no tactical considerations which would have led defence counsel not to seek an appropriate direction.  
     
      
    30 The Crown responded by submitting that the relevance of the record of interview was merely to strengthen what was otherwise a strong Crown case having regard to the observations and listening device material. Furthermore, it was suggested that its utility was limited to rebutting any suggestion that the appellant was co-operative and forthcoming with police and was not put as corroborating any aspect of the evidence. 
     
      
    31 With respect to Rule 4 the Crown submitted that there may have been significant tactical reasons for the appellant’s counsel not making a request for an Edwards direction at the trial. To do so would have drawn attention to the prospect that the appellant was lying in the interview and would have elevated the issue beyond the significance which it had previously had in the trial. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion, the remarks made by the prosecutor in his address to the jury required that an Edwards direction should have been given. But for the reference by the prosecutor to “consciousness of guilt” the submission of the Crown may have passed without comment, and the effect of the evidence been confined to matters of credit. However, once the claimed consequence of the evidence was elevated by the prosecutor to “consciousness of guilt” a reminder that persons may tell lies for reasons other than to avoid detection was called for. 
     
      
    33 As I have indicated no complaint was made in relation to this aspect of the judge’s directions at the trial. However, it could hardly be that the remarks by the prosecutor went unnoticed and that a decision not to seek further directions was inadvertently overlooked. The record of interview presented obvious difficulties for the defence and counsel must have been both conscious of those difficulties and alert to how the matter was dealt with by the prosecutor and, more particularly, in the directions given by the trial judge.  
     
      
    34 In these circumstances I am inclined to the view that defence counsel must have made a conscious and informed decision not to seek a redirection. This is understandable given the fact that it would have been necessary for the direction to be framed upon the basis that the jury may have come to the conclusion that the appellant was lying. This would have given greater emphasis to the record of interview and may have inadvertently strengthened the Crown case. 
     
      
    35 In any event I am satisfied that the Crown case was strong. Even without the record of interview the involvement of the appellant in the enterprise was admitted, the only question being the appellant’s knowledge that importation of cocaine was proposed. There was significant evidence, apart from the record of interview, to support the jury’s conclusion in this respect. 
     
      
    36 For these reasons I would decline leave pursuant to rule 4. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable  
       
      
    37 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.“ 
        
       
      
    38 As I noted in Regina v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223 at [48] the application of the section has proved troublesome, but was authoritatively considered by the High Court in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606, M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493. Gaudron, Gummow and McHugh JJ in Jones at 450-1, as well as Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA at 615 held that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported, the relevant test is that formulated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-4: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
        
       
      
    39 In R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223 I stressed that the task of the court was to supervise the findings of the tribunal of fact and I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        MFA  
        the High Court was concerned with whether the analysis of the facts of a trial by this Court was appropriate. In carrying out the appellate task the joint judgment emphasised that it was relevant to identify whether the evidence in the Crown case was ""cogent and unequivocal, and it was not inherently implausible""[30]. The relevant question is whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt"" [36]. 
         
         
        In  
        MFA,  
        McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ joined in a separate judgment. Their Honours emphasised that it was important to focus on the language of s 6(1) which because of the inclusion of the word ""unreasonable"" ""seems to state a very broad test""[47]. However, their Honours point out that the seeming amplitude is to be restricted by the context. Being a verdict of a jury which is given a special place in the law to set it aside involves ""a serious step""[49]. The requirement of the section is that the court must determine whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"" notwithstanding that the jury has returned a guilty verdict. 
         
         
        Embracing the test adopted by the majority of the court in  
        M  
        the joint judgment stated: 
         
         
          
          ‘Instead of asking whether the jury 'must' or were 'bound to' have a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was 'open to the jury' to be satisfied of the accused's guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict 'upon the whole of the evidence' [55]. 
          
         
         
        The joint judgment offered the following by way of guidance: 
         
         
          
          ‘The majority in  
          M 
           pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
          
         
         
          
          If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56]. 
          
         
         
        In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention [96].” 
         
        
       
      
    40 In Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 503, Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ expressed the relevant question in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘… if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, then it ought to have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance.’  
        
       
      
    41 It must be emphasised that this formulation of the relevant question must be understood in a manner consistent with the principles in M. More is required than the mere formulation of possible alternative interpretations of the evidence that are consistent with innocence.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s argument 
       
      
    42 It was conceded by the appellant that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that he knew the boat and vehicle were to be used for some kind of criminal purpose, but not that he knew that it was for the importation of drugs. It was submitted that the only evidence in the Crown case advanced to support the latter proposition was the appellant’s knowledge that Lawrence was often involved in illegal schemes.  
     
      
    43 The appellant submitted that there is no reference to drugs or anything that could be regarded as a code for drugs in any of the recorded conversations. Furthermore, it was submitted that there was no evidence that, when the original arrests took place, the appellant was warned by Cornwall, or anyone else, to be careful which it was said would have been likely if the appellant knew of the “true” enterprise. The appellant also emphasised that evidence of a friendship with Lawrence extending over many years, makes more plausible the proposition that the appellant might have cooperated with Lawrence as a favour, without necessarily being told of the importation. It was submitted that evidence that some of the others involved, namely Brockenshire and Norris, were not told of the drug importation supports the plausibility of Lawrence neglecting to inform the appellant of the use planned for his purchases. The appellant argued that there was no particular reason in the context of the operation why the appellant should know of the complete enterprise.  
     
      
    44 Three particular conversations were addressed in some detail in the submissions: the conversations of 24 April 2001 beginning 10:50 am, and 11:54 am and 16 May 2001 beginnng 13:09. The conversation of 24 April 2001 at 10:50 am refers to the appellant’s awareness of the risk of involvement and contains a discussion with respect to price negotiations. The appellant contends that it does not provide evidence of the appellant’s understanding of the conduct creating the risk and does not have the character of a conversation about the pricing of drugs. At 11:57, the same day Lawrence is recorded as saying to the appellant “you know what I’m gonna use it for”, to which the appellant replies “no”. It was submitted that this suggests the appellant did not know the purpose of the enterprise. Furthermore, it was argued that it is not clear what “it” refers to. Finally, it was submitted, that it cannot be inferred that, if Lawrence had told the appellant of a proposed use of the boat, he would have told him the truth.  
     
      
    45 It was the appellant’s submission that the long conversation on 16 May 2001 between Lawrence and the appellant in which a boat is discussed concerns a yacht, which Lawrence was planning to charter and then steal, not the Zodiac purchased by the appellant. Furthermore, the appellant emphasised that the Crown conceded at the first trial, and no suggestion to the contrary was advanced in the second trial, that a reference to ‘the dope’ by Lawrence in this conversation referred to Brockenshire not to the drugs to be imported.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    46 The Crown accepts that the recorded conversations are at times ambiguous, but submits, in my opinion correctly, that the whole of the evidence available to the jury must be considered when determining whether the appellant was aware of the enterprise. The Crown Prosecutor suggested to the jury that from the recorded conversations they could conclude that: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘Bolus was perfectly well aware of the nature of the enterprise with which he was involved, not just hiding the identity of a boat or putting money in a bank account. 
        
       
       
        
        When you listen to what is being said you will draw the inference that he knew full well what he was involving himself in’.  
        
       
      
    47 The Crown emphasised that there was a series of meetings between the appellant and Lawrence, as well as others involved in the importation, apart from the recorded conversations. Given evidence of the close relationship between the appellant and Lawrence, confirmed in both conversations of 24 April, and the appellant’s knowledge of the serious nature of the venture, it was open to the jury to conclude that he knew of the purpose for which the boat and vehicle had been purchased. Apart from his role in the purchase of the boat and vehicle, the appellant was aware of the subsequent steps to secrete it from the authorities whilst it was stored for later use in the enterprise.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion as to unreasonable verdict 
       
      
    48 The question is whether, on the whole of the evidence, the inference that the appellant knew of the proposed drug importation was open to the jury. While counsel advanced a number of alternative hypotheses, such as people-smuggling or larceny at sea, as possibilities, there is no evidence that the appellant understood that these were ventures for which the boat was to be used.  
     
      
    49 It was argued that there was no reason for the appellant to be told the true purpose of his purchases, that he was good friends with Lawrence and so would do a favour without questioning, and that Lawrence did not necessarily reveal his plans to all who were involved. Each of these propositions required analysis but they were matters for the jury to consider having regard to all of the evidence. This Court should not intervene (see MFA v R (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 621).  
     
      
    50 An essential element of the appellant’s argument was the fact that drugs are not referred to directly in the recorded conversations. This may be accepted but the evidence presented by the Crown is capable of supporting the inference that the appellant knew that Cornwall was involved in importing drugs. It was obvious that there was extensive and detailed preparation required for the enterprise. It was the Crown case that apart from the boat and vehicle the appellant had obtained the charts necessary to arrange the rendezvous point. It was open to the jury to accept this evidence which implied a knowledge of the appellant in the purpose of the enterprise. I am satisfied that the evidence was such that the jury could find that the appellant was aware of the true nature of the enterprise. 
     
      
    51 Juries are required to employ their common sense and experience of the world. It is by no means surprising that a jury accepting this obligation would infer that someone, consciously engaged in some illicit activity at Australia’s borders, would know the subject of his activity. A fortiori is this so when the “knowledge” required is merely “belief” or “aware(ness) of the likelihood, in the sense that there is a significant or real chance” as a number of remarks in the High Court, referred to at some length in Cao v R [2006] NSWCCA 89 at [27] et seq, make clear. 
     
      
    52 Obviously account would need to be taken of the evidence in a particular case but in the absence of more than I have postulated in the immediate preceding paragraph, I see no reason why a jury might not reasonably be persuaded of the inference beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    53 This case can be distinguished from others where an inference of knowledge on the part of an accused was held not to be available. In R v Mato and Rusu [1999] NSWCCA 395 the issue was whether Mr Mato knew that Ms Rusu had just robbed a bank at the time of the robbery or as he drove her away from the bank. The only evidence going to this knowledge was ‘the fact of earlier financial difficulties or obtaining credit’ which was held by the court at [24] to ‘not support an inference that he learnt about it after she emerged from the bank and during the period they were driving away presumably to their home.’ In the present case the evidence discloses the appellant’s involvement in the operation to such an extent that it could be readily concluded that he knew what it was about. 
     
      
    54 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    55 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 August 2005 a sixteen year old boy by the name of BT was travelling home from school. During the school day there had been argument involving BT’s sister. BT intervened to protect his sister. He was told by a number of boys of similar age to himself that he would be attacked after school. That is why, when he was confronted by a number of young people on the train, he was scared and armed himself with a pair of scissors. One can understand his apprehension. He was confronted by about eight boys of similar age to himself. 2 Whilst on the train he had received a cutthroat gesture from another person who mouthed the words, “you’re dead”. BT did not get off at his usual station which was Granville because he thought if he got off at Central he would be safer. He never got there. 3 The offender, ES, was one of a group of boys threatening BT. He was not a student at the school and was not involved in the initial altercation at the school. Nevertheless, he decided to join in, for reasons which are difficult to understand. One of the group punched BT to his face. The others then became involved, kicking and punching him while he attempted to protect himself. 4 In the course of evidence, these events were described as a fight. It is a most inaccurate description. I am satisfied that what was happening was a group of boys punching and kicking and overwhelming a single boy who was unable to offer any effective resistance at all. 5 I mentioned before, that BT had armed himself with scissors. These were held partially concealed with the blade up the sleeve of his school uniform. Once the attack upon him commenced, they dropped to the floor. The offender, who had been punching and kicking BT along with the others, picked up the scissors and stabbed BT in the back twice. The group of boys broke off their attack, leaving BT battered and bleeding. 6 Assistance was summonsed and BT was taken to hospital where he was operated upon. He had suffered a number of injuries. Amongst the most serious were a collapsed lung, a broken jaw and a broken tooth. He spent five days in hospital and because of his broken jaw could not eat solid food for about a month.7 It was the offender alone who stabbed BT. He was also involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the others to attack BT by punching and kicking him. To join in an attack which leaves a young boy with a broken jaw and a broken tooth is bad enough, but to stab a defenceless person to the back is seriously criminal and deserving of severe punishment, even despite the offender’s relative youth. 8 The issue arises as to why the offender would pick up the scissors and stab BT. What was it that made the offender perform such a callous and violent act? The offender gave evidence during the course of the sentencing proceedings. He said that he stabbed BT after he was cut by the scissors as BT was trying to defend himself. He said, “I got hurt and just reaction”. 9 The suggestion that BT was defending himself was contrary to the statement of facts tendered by the Crown without objection from counsel appearing for ES. That statement of facts read, “at no time did the victim attempt to defend himself”. That statement appears to have been based upon a passage from a statement made by Jessica Facaris who was a young woman seated in the train carriage at the time BT was attacked. Accordingly, the Crown sought leave to reopen its case and called evidence from EF and BT. 10 After considering the evidence on the issue, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that BT made no attempt to defend himself, apart from covering up his face with his arm and leaning forward. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at no stage did he actually use the scissors and that they fell to the ground in the course of him being assaulted. If the offender was cut during the course of these events I have described, it was as he, himself, was stabbing BT. 11 The offender gave evidence that he was cut on his right palm and cut on his knuckles as well. When the offender saw a doctor sometime after assaulting BT the doctor noted scars and a swollen fifth knuckle. He made no mention of any injury at all to the offender’s palm. This is consistent with the custody management records kept by police which were tendered by the Crown. 12 Neither of the two officers who filled in those forms noted any injury on or complaint of injury by the offender. 13 Further, although JF’s view was on occasions blocked by the boys who were attacking BT, she saw no attempt on his part to defend himself, apart from covering his face. Certainly she did not see everything because her view of BT was at times blocked by the boys who were attacking him, but at no time did she see BT wave his hands around, nor did she see him do anything which would have caused one of the boys who was attacking him to be cut. BT himself has no memory after being first punched or kicked.14 The Crown also tendered transcripts of electronic recorded interviews of three boys who were, to some extent, involved in these events. I note two important things about these interviews. Firstly, there is the possibility that they were attempting to maximise the role played by someone other than themselves in order to exculpate themselves from involvement in these offences. Secondly, and this is related to the first matter I have mentioned, they each nominated the offender as being the person who first attacked BT, but the Crown asked me to proceed on the basis that this was not the case. 15 Despite these qualifications, I do find that there is support for the version of events suggested by the Crown - namely, that BT did not try and defend himself beyond merely covering up and more precisely the offender was not cut as BT tried to defend himself with the scissors. I refer, in particular, to the interview with CD at 206, the interview with KC at 86 and 168 and 499 and the interview with H A-M at 411 and following. 16 It is clear, indeed it is conceded by Mr McAnulty on behalf of the offender, that the offender had already been inflicting violence upon BT before he stabbed him in the back. I find that once he began joining in the attack, it was not a reaction to him being cut which led him to stab BT. His decision to do that has to be explained in some other way, most likely to do with the offender’s immaturity and his presence in a larger group of violent young males. 17 As a result of the offender’s conduct he has pleaded guilty to an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon BT with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. This is a serious criminal offence, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. 18 The offender was born on 11 March 1990, so he was only fifteen years old at the time of the offence and is only sixteen years old now. Although there was nothing reported on the criminal history handed to me by the Crown, it appears that the offender has come to the attention of police before and been dealt with in the Children’s Court or cautioned by police. This is consistent with the contents of a Juvenile Justice report which speaks about the offender coming under the influence of a negative peer group. To escape that peer group, he moved to Tasmania to live with his cousin in August 2005. He was on holiday back in Sydney when this offence occurred. 19 Since returning to Sydney permanently the offender has begun to live with his sister and her husband, ZP. It seems that he is a very positive influence in the offender’s life. He and his wife recognise that the offender needed assistance and needed a change in his environment and it was for those reasons that they offered to have the offender live with them. The offender is happy with the current situation and no longer associates with the others who were involved in this offence. Those people interviewed by the officers from the Juvenile Justice say that they have noticed an improvement in the offender’s presentation and behaviour.20 The offender is currently at High School where he hopes to complete his HSC and then go to university. He also has a part time job assisting his mother in a café which she manages. The offender expressed his remorse both to the authors of the report and in court before me. He, like many sixteen year old boys, is not a person who speaks at length about emotional issues and I have taken this into account in deciding whether or not his expressions of remorse are genuine. I am satisfied they are. 21 It was suggested that the offender got involved in this offence because he was held in esteem by his peers because he was physically larger than a lot of them. The offender liked being perceived as being a leader rather than a follower and when the opportunity presented itself, he, because of immaturity common to fifteen year old boys, demonstrated that leadership in a most inappropriate way. 22 As I mentioned, there is a standard non-parole period for this offence of seven years. The fact that the offender pleaded guilty means that the seven year period is not of direct application but it remains as a guide post. Quite clearly, the fact that the offender was a relatively immature fifteen year old boy when he committed this offence, is a significant factor suggesting a much lower non-parole period than the standard set by the legislature. 23 The plea of guilty has a utilitarian value. I note, however, that the plea was entered only after the offender was committed for trial and there was the need for there to be a hearing to resolve disputed issues of fact. Nevertheless, the plea does have substantial utilitarian value. There were real issues of identity involved and a trial of this allegation would have occupied some time and required the calling of a number of witnesses. In these circumstances, I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about twenty per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. 24 Although a custodial sentence is, especially in the case of children, a sentence of last resort, I am satisfied that such a sentence is required. It seems indeed that it was conceded by Mr McAnulty on behalf of the offender. The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He has moved away from those elements in his life which led him to offend. He has shown positive attitude towards schooling and taken steps towards his rehabilitation. 25 Quite clear, the offender did not plan to stab BT. He did not come armed with a weapon and only decided to use the scissors upon BT they had been dropped to the floor. The stabbing was thus as Mr McAnulty described it, a moment of madness. However, the offender’s participation in the attack upon the unfortunate BT is not in the same category. 26 Quite clearly there are special circumstances. In this case they relate to the offender’s youth and the desire to see the positive rehabilitative steps which the offender has been taking continue whilst he is on parole. 27 Of course, although I am sentencing the offender according to law, that does not mean that I should treat him as though he was an adult. General deterrence is to be given less weight when sentencing this offender than when sentencing someone who is more mature. The rehabilitation of the offender is to be given greater weight as well. The offender requires guidance and assistance.28 However, none of that means that the offender does not deserve to be punished and significantly so for his violent actions. Personal deterrence is also important in order to ensure that the offender understands he must not act this way again. 29 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to date from today. The non-parole period will expire on 22 June 2007 on which date the offender is to be released to parole. I set a total term of two years imprisonment and I make an order directing that the offender serve the whole of that sentence as a juvenile offender.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 31 October 2005, after a trial presided over by me, the jury found the prisoner Bradley David Cooper guilty on all of the thirteen counts in the indictment which had been presented against him. 
     
      
    2 The first count in the indictment charged the prisoner with having on 3 December 2000 corruptly offered to give William Herbert Howard an agent of HIH Casualty & General Insurance Limited (to which I will refer as “HIH C&G”) a benefit, namely cash and employment by a company associated with the prisoner, the expectation of which would tend to influence Mr Howard to show favour to companies associated with the prisoner in relation to the affairs of HIH C&G, namely in the processing of claims by those companies. 
     
      
    3 Each of counts 2 to 6 in the indictment charged the prisoner with having corruptly given Mr Howard a benefit, namely an amount of cash, the receipt of which by Mr Howard would tend to influence Mr Howard to show favour to companies associated with the prisoner in the manner alleged in the first count. 
     
      
    4 The offences charged in the first six counts in the indictment were all offences under s 249B(2)(b) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years. These offences can conveniently be referred to as “the bribery offences”. 
     
      
    5 In each of the remaining counts in the indictment, that is counts 7 to 13, the prisoner was charged with having published a statement to HIH C&G which he knew to be false in a material particular, with the intent to obtain a financial advantage for another person, being a company associated with the prisoner. The offences charged in counts 7 to 13 were all offences under s 178BB of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. These offences can conveniently be referred to as “the false statement offences”. 
     
      
    6 The proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner have been protracted, due mainly to the desire of the parties to collect and adduce evidence for the proceedings on sentence beyond the evidence given in the trial, to put detailed written submissions on sentence and to put oral submissions on sentence. On 2 December 2005 the Crown Prosecutor handed up lengthy written submissions and made oral submissions. On 30 March 2006 counsel for the prisoner tendered certain documentary evidence, referred to written submissions which had been lodged and made oral submissions. On 19 May 2006 counsel for the prisoner tendered further documentary evidence and made further oral submissions. I received written submissions from the Crown in reply to the prisoner’s written submissions. 
     
      
    7 The prisoner, who had previously been on bail, went into custody on 31 October 2005 after the jury returned their verdicts of guilty and he has since remained in custody as a remand prisoner. 
     
      
    8 The prisoner did not give evidence at the trial and did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    9 As the sentencing judge it is part of my function to determine the facts relevant to sentencing for each of the offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced. I am mindful that facts adverse to the prisoner must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, whereas facts favourable to the prisoner need only be proved on the balance of probabilities. It may be the case that on some matters the evidence available to me does not permit me to make any finding. 
     
      
       
      Facts Relevant to the Offences 
       
       Companies and Individuals 
       
      
    10 HIH Insurance Limited (which I will refer to as “HIH”) was a large insurance company. HIH C&G was a member of the HIH group of companies. HIH C&G held the bank accounts of the HIH group of companies, so that if any claim made by a company associated with the prisoner against HIH was settled on terms requiring the payment of money to a company associated with the prisoner, that payment would be made by HIH C&G. 
     
      
    11 Up until some time in December 2000 Mr Ray Williams was the Chief Executive Officer of HIH. In December 2000 Mr Williams was replaced as Chief Executive Officer of HIH by Mr Randolph Wein. 
     
      
    12 Mr William Howard, the person referred to in the bribery offences, who had been the General Manager Finance for the HIH group became in December 2000 the Chief Investment Officer of the HIH group. Mr Howard’s employer was HIH C&G. 
     
      
    13 The prisoner was not at any time a director or an officer or an employee of HIH or of any other company in the HIH group. 
     
      
    14 In late 2000 and early 2001, as both the prisoner and Mr. Howard knew, HIH was in serious financial difficulties, including being seriously short of cash. Mr. Howard knew that his continued employment by HIH C&G was in jeopardy. On 15 March 2001 a provisional liquidator of HIH was appointed.  
     
      
    15 In 1999 HIH had taken over a company FAI Insurances Limited (which I will refer to as “FAI Insurances”). Before the takeover Mr Rodney Adler had been the Chief Executive Officer of FAI Insurances. After the takeover Mr Adler became a director of HIH. 
     
      
    16 A company particularly associated with the prisoner was FAI Home Security Pty Limited, (which I will refer to as “FAI Home Security”). FAI Home Security carried on the business of selling alarm systems to businesses and households. The alarm systems which FAI Home Security sold were manufactured by a company named Ness Security Products Pty Limited, (which I will refer to as “Ness”). The prisoner was the Chief Executive Officer of FAI Home Security. 
     
      
    17 In late 2000 and early 2001 FAI Home Security was a wholly owned subsidiary of a company incorporated in a state of the United States named Home Security International Incorporated (which I will refer to as “HSI”). The prisoner was the Chief Executive Officer of HSI, apart from a period between September and November 2000 during which Mr Adler was its Chief Executive Officer. As a result of the takeover of FAI Insurances by HIH, HIH acquired a large shareholding in HSI. 
     
      
    18 Another company was FAI Finance Corporation Pty Limited, (which I will refer to as “FAI Finance Corporation”). FAI Finance Corporation carried on the business of financing credit purchases of alarm systems from FAI Home Security. The General Manager of FAI Finance Corporation was Mr. Jeffery Jurd.  
     
      
    19 Over the years there were a number of changes in the shareholding in FAI Finance Corporation. Prior to February 1995 FAI Home Security had held shares in FAI Finance Corporation but in February 1995 FAI Home Security disposed of the shares it had been holding in FAI Finance Corporation and FAI Home Security did not again hold any shares in FAI Finance Corporation until December 1997. In 1999, after the takeover of FAI Insurances by HIH, 50 per cent of the shares in FAI Finance Corporation were held by or on behalf of HIH and 50 per cent of the shares were held by FAI Home Security. In about March 2000 HIH or another company in the HIH group acquired from FAI Home Security 50 per cent of the shares in FAI Finance Corporation, so that from then on all the shares in FAI Finance Corporation were held by or on behalf of HIH. 
     
      
    20 Other companies associated with the prisoner were Vision Publishing Pty Limited (which I will refer to as “Vision Publishing”), the Goodwill Group Pty Limited and Speak Easy Pty Limited. The prisoner beneficially owned all of the shares in the Goodwill Group Pty Limited and Speak Easy Pty Limited. Vision Publishing was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. 
     
      
    21 A consequence of the takeover of FAI Insurances by HIH was that HIH was brought into various business relationships with the prisoner and companies associated with him, which had been in certain business relationships with FAI Insurances.  
     
      
    22 Towards the end of the year 2000 HIH was working towards what was described at the trial as a “divorce” or separation between HIH, on the one hand, and the prisoner and his companies, on the other hand. Particular matters to be resolved as part of the divorce included that HIH wished to purchase the right to use the name “FAI”, the prisoner wished to acquire the shares in HSI which were held by HIH and a number of claims which the prisoner had made against HIH on behalf of companies associated with him. Mr Howard was authorised by Mr Williams and Mr Adler to deal with the prisoner with respect to these matters. 
     
      
       
      The Bribery Offences 
       
      
    23 On Sunday 3 December 2000 the prisoner and Mr Howard had a meeting at a suburban hotel. The meeting had been arranged by the prisoner. No one else was present at the meeting. 
     
      
    24 At the meeting the prisoner produced a memorandum dated 21 March 2000 from Mr Colin Richardson, a consultant who was then working for HIH. The memorandum had been sent by Mr. Richardson to the prisoner. In the memorandum Mr Richardson set out his understanding of “the revised proposal regarding the purchase by HIH of FFC (that is the purchase by HIH of shares in FAI Finance Corporation) and other matters”. The final paragraph of this memorandum reads:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As a separate matter, HIH has agreed to sponsor the forthcoming seminars to be produced by Vision (that is Vision Publishing) in an amount of $1,200,000. Details of this sponsorship will need to be finalised directly with HIH”. 
        
       
      
    25 At the meeting on 3 December 2000 the prisoner complained to Mr Howard that the agreement to sponsor the seminars had not been honoured. 
     
      
    26 At the meeting the prisoner said to Mr Howard that, if Mr Howard helped the prisoner to get outstanding issues sorted out, he would “look after” Mr Howard. The prisoner explained what he meant by “looking after” Mr Howard, by saying that he would pay Mr Howard cash and that there would be a position available for Mr Howard at HSI. Mr Howard said that he would prefer cash. The prisoner said that cash would be easy for him. The prisoner said that, when Mr Howard settled the Vision Publishing claim, the prisoner would arrange a payment for him. 
     
      
    27 This conduct by the prisoner on 3 December 2001 was the basis of the first count in the indictment. By returning a verdict of guilty on count 1 the jury showed that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offer alleged in count 1 had been made by the prisoner, that the expectation of the benefit offered would have had a tendency to influence Mr Howard to show favour to companies associated with the prisoner in the processing of their claims and that the offer was made corruptly, that is with an intention on the part of the prisoner to influence Mr Howard to show favour to companies associated with the prisoner. 
     
      
    28 Subsequently, the prisoner communicated from time to time with Mr Howard concerning claims by one or other of the prisoner’s companies against HIH. In order to give the appearance to other persons, including other officers or employees of HIH or HIH C&G, that Mr. Howard was dealing with the claims in good faith, it was agreed between the prisoner and Mr Howard that a procedure would be followed in relation to each claim, whereby the prisoner would submit a claim with supporting documents, there would be negotiations between the prisoner and Mr Howard, a settlement would be arrived at for an amount lower than the original amount of the claim and the settlement amount would be paid. This procedure was carried out in relation to a number of claims. It will be necessary to refer to a number of these claims in detail later in these remarks. 
     
      
    29 Pursuant to the offer made on 3 December 2000, the prisoner made five payments of cash to Mr Howard. 
     
      
    30 On or about 22 December 2000 at the prisoner’s office at North Sydney the prisoner handed Mr Howard an envelope containing approximately $20,000 in cash, saying “here’s a Christmas present”. This payment was the subject of the second count in the indictment., 
     
      
    31 The payment which was the subject of the third count in the indictment was a payment of approximately $30,000 in cash made by the prisoner to Mr Howard at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in the city. In his evidence at the trial Mr Howard could not recall whether this payment, or the payment charged in the fifth count, was the second payment made to him by the prisoner. If this payment of $30,000 was the second payment, it was made in January 2001. If it was not the second payment, it was made in February 2001. At the Ritz Carlton Hotel the prisoner and Mr Howard sat at a table in a bar and cash was transferred from a bag the prisoner had to a bag Mr Howard had. 
     
      
    32 Mr Howard spent a holiday at Noosa in Queensland between 18 January 2001 and 27 January 2001. While he was on holiday at Noosa, a third payment of approximately $9,000 in cash was made to Mr Howard at the resort at which he was staying. A difference between this payment and the other payments is that the payment was made, not by the prisoner personally, but by an intermediary on behalf of the prisoner, who, acting quite innocently, handed over an envelope to Mr Howard which contained the cash. This payment was the subject of the fourth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    33 The payment which was the subject of the fifth count in the indictment was a payment of approximately $40,000 in cash made by the prisoner to Mr Howard at the Sheraton on the Park Hotel in the city. If this payment was the second payment made by the prisoner, it was made in January 2001; if it was the fourth payment, it was made in February 2001. On this occasion the prisoner picked up Mr Howard in his Ferrari vehicle, drove to the Hotel and in a lounge in the Hotel the prisoner handed Mr Howard an envelope containing approximately $40,000 in cash. 
     
      
    34 The payment which was the subject of the sixth count in the indictment was made in early March 2001 at the prisoner’s residential apartment at Balmoral. The prisoner took cash out of a drawer and handed Mr Howard either $25,000 or $20,000 in cash. 
     
      
    35 The total amount of cash paid by the prisoner to Mr. Howard was approximately $124,000 or approximately $119,000. 
     
      
    36 On the Crown case at the trial the individual payments made by the prisoner to Mr Howard were not necessarily specifically linked to the settlement by Mr Howard of any particular claim made on behalf of a company associated with the prisoner and in some cases were linked to the settlement of a number of claims. 
     
      
    37 By returning verdicts of guilty on all of counts 2 to 6, the jury showed that, on each count, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the payment alleged by the Crown had been made, that the payment would have had the requisite tendency to influence Mr Howard and that the payment had been made by the prisoner corruptly. 
     
      
       
        
        The False Statement Offences 
        
       
       
      Counts 7 - 10 
       
      
    38 As stated earlier in these remarks, at the meeting on 3 December 2000 the prisoner complained to Mr Howard that HIH had not honoured the agreement recorded in the final paragraph of Mr Richardson’s memorandum of 21 March 2000 to pay $1.2m by way of sponsoring seminars to be produced by Vision Publishing. 
     
      
    39 In December 2000 the prisoner proposed that this claim by Vision Publishing against HIH for $1.2m be satisfied, by offsetting against it amounts owing by the Goodwill Group Pty Limited to FAI Finance Corporation under two factoring agreements, leaving a balance of $347,500 to be paid to Vision Publishing. 
     
      
    40 To give the appearance that he had been diligently pressing the claim for some months, the prisoner in December 2000 fabricated four letters from Vision Publishing to HIH bearing the dates 12 May 2000, 16 August 2000, 4 October 2000, and 21 November 2000. 
     
      
    41 The proposal made by the prisoner for settlement of the claim was accepted by Mr Howard. On 8 December 2000 a cheque for $347,500 was drawn by HIH C&G in favour of Vision Publishing and by 11 December 2000 (which was the next working day) that cheque had been paid. 
     
      
    42 At some time between 8 December 2000 and 15 December 2000, in a conversation between the prisoner and Mr Howard, the prisoner, in the context of discussing Vision Publishing, asked Mr Howard “does Ray know?” Mr Howard replied, “no, he doesn’t”. The idea had occurred to the prisoner that Mr Ray Williams might be unaware that the Vision Publishing sponsorship undertaking had been discharged, particularly as the discharge had been effected by the indirect method of an offsetting agreement and a payment of the balance, and that, if Mr Williams was unaware that the undertaking had already been discharged, the prisoner should try to obtain a second performance of the Vision Publishing undertaking. 
     
      
    43 Mr Howard, of course, was fully aware that the Vision Publishing sponsorship undertaking had already been satisfied in full. However, as a result of the corrupt offer which had been made to him by the prisoner, Mr Howard acquiesced in the prisoner obtaining, and actively assisted the prisoner to obtain, a second performance of the Vision Publishing undertaking. 
     
      
    44 On 15 December 2000 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard, enclosing a letter from the prisoner to Mr Williams, to which was attached a copy of Mr Richardson’s memorandum of 21 March 2000. Although the facsimile transmission to Mr Howard and the letter to Mr. Williams bore the date 6 December 2000, the transmission confirmation sheet shows that the fax was actually sent on 15 December 2000. 
     
      
    45 In the letter to Mr Williams the prisoner said that all outstanding issues had been finalised, except for one issue. The one outstanding issue was said to be the undertaking by HIH to sponsor the Vision Publishing seminars. The prisoner asserted “Vision has not to date received its $1.2m as agreed by you via Colin Richardson. In order to protect Vision’s interests I need this outstanding sum paid now”. The statement “Vision has not to date received its $1.2m as agreed by you” was the false statement alleged in count 7 in the indictment. 
     
      
    46 Although such a statement would have been true as at 6 December 2000, the date borne by the facsimile transmission, it was false as at 15 December 2000, the date on which the statement was published by the sending of the facsimile transmission, because the undertaking to pay Vision Publishing $1.2m had been satisfied in full by 11 December 2000. On 15 December 2000 the prisoner, knowing that the claim by Vision Publishing for $1.2m had already been satisfied, falsely claimed that it had not been paid and sought to obtain a further payment of the sum of $1.2m. 
     
      
    47 On 20 December 2000 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard dated 20 December 2000, in which he responded to a letter dated 19 December 2000 from Mr Howard. In paragraph 17 of this facsimile transmission the prisoner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Although not on your list, I plan to settle the $1.2m sponsorship agreement, which will make a very big difference to my personal cash flow”. 
        
       
      
    48 The statement in the facsimile transmission “I plan to settle the $1.2m sponsorship agreement” was the false statement alleged in count 8 of the indictment. The statement was false, in that it represented that the undertaking to pay the $1.2m sponsorship was still outstanding, whereas the undertaking had been satisfied in full by 11 December. Mr Howard, of course, was aware that the sponsorship claim had already been satisfied. However, the prisoner intended that the false statement in the facsimile transmission to Mr. Howard would be used to deceive other officers or employees of HIH or HIH C&G. 
     
      
    49 Mr Howard returned to work after the Christmas holidays on 3 January 2001. On 3 January 2001 the prisoner told Mr Howard that he was going to contact Mr Williams with regard to Vision Publishing and he told Mr Howard to send a memorandum to Mr Williams, stating that the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim was still outstanding. The prisoner and Mr Howard collaborated in drafting the terms of a memorandum to be sent by Mr Howard to Mr Williams. 
     
      
    50 This memorandum was sent to Mr Williams on 3 January 2001. The subject of the memorandum was stated to be “Vision Publishing $1.2m”. In paragraph 1 of the memorandum Mr Howard said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have been asked by Brad Cooper (many times) for the finalisation of this issue as part of the agreement to finalise all matters between HIH and HSI”. 
        
       
       
      A copy of Mr Richardson’s memorandum of 21 March 2000 was attached to this memorandum.  
       
      
    51 The memorandum, which was sent to Mr Williams at the instigation of the prisoner and in the drafting of which he had participated, was clearly intended by the prisoner to deceive Mr Williams into believing that the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim of $1.2m was still outstanding. 
     
      
    52 After receiving the facsimile transmission, Mr Williams wrote a letter to Mr Howard. In the letter Mr Williams gave Mr Howard a short history of the Vision Publishing sponsorship matter, as Mr Williams knew it. It is obvious from the terms of the letter that Mr Williams was quite unaware that the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim had already been satisfied. In his letter Mr Williams advised Mr Howard “clearly we cannot pay over a sponsorship fee, without the full details of what is now proposed and, most importantly, when the event will be staged”. 
     
      
    53 On 5 January 2001 the prisoner and Mr Howard purported to settle the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim for $750,000. Both the prisoner and Mr Howard knew that the claim had already been settled but they engaged in the charade of purporting to settle the claim for part of the amount claimed by the prisoner. Some attempt was made to make it appear that the claim was a genuine claim, separate from the claim by Vision Publishing which had already been settled, by describing the claim as being a claim by the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. 
     
      
    54 On 8 January 2001 a facsimile transmission was sent on behalf of the prisoner on the letterhead of the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. I am satisfied that this facsimile transmission, like all other facsimile transmissions or letters from the prisoner’s office, whether or not they were signed by the prisoner, was sent with the prisoner’s authority. 
     
      
    55 Enclosed with this facsimile transmission was an invoice dated 27 December 2000 for “the full amount of the sponsorship package and consultancy fees for the years 2000 and 2001”. The amount of the invoice was $825,000, which was made up of $750,000 plus GST at 10 percent. The invoice stated that $450,000 was immediately payable and that the balance of $375,000 was payable within four months. 
     
      
    56 In the facsimile transmission with which the invoice was enclosed it was stated “since this amount is extremely overdue, could you please make the necessary arrangements to transfer the funds directly into our bank account”. 
     
      
    57 This statement that the amount of the invoice was extremely overdue was false, in that the amount of the invoice was not overdue or due at all. This false statement was the subject of the ninth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    58 Mr. Howard arranged for the amount of $412,500, being half of $825,000, to be promptly paid by HIH C&G to the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. 
     
      
    59 In a memorandum of 12 January 2001 to the prisoner Mr Howard said that HIH might make the final payment earlier than in four months, if the prisoner was prepared to accept a discounted amount.  
     
      
    60 On 15 January 2001 the prisoner sent a memorandum to Mr Howard. The memorandum began “I have received your letter confirming the amount of $375,000 owing by HIH to me”. This statement was false, in that no money at all was owing. This false statement was the subject of the tenth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    61 The prisoner agreed that the final payment to be made could be discounted, provided that it was paid immediately. Mr. Howard arranged for a discounted final payment of $325,000 to be made by HIH C&G to the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. 
     
      
      Counts 11 and 12 
       
      
    62 For some years up to September 1998 a mutual association Credit Reference Australia provided to its members information about the credit standing or credit worthiness of persons with whom members proposed to do business.  
     
      
    63 In about September 1998 Credit Reference Australia demutualised , that is, converted itself into a company limited by shares, which was called Data Advantage Limited. 
     
      
    64 Shares in Data Advantage Limited were allocated to persons or companies who had been members of Credit Reference Australia. There was a basic allocation of 500 shares in Data Advantage Limited to every person or company who had been a member of Credit Reference Australia. Further shares were allocated to persons or companies who had been members of Credit Reference Australia, on the basis of one share for every dollar a member had been invoiced by Credit Reference Australia over the three years between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1997. 
     
      
    65 A total number of 290,363 shares in Data Advantage Limited were allocated to FAI Insurances. 217,009 of those shares were referable to amounts for which FAI Finance Corporation had been invoiced by Credit Reference Australia between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1997. 
     
      
    66 The prisoner claimed that some of the shares in Data Advantage Limited which had been allocated to FAI Insurances should have been received by FAI Home Security, on the grounds that between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1997 shares in FAI Finance Corporation had been held by FAI Home Security. 
     
      
    67 In early January 2001 the prisoner asked Mr Howard why his Data Advantage claim had not yet been settled. 
     
      
    68 On 7 January 2001 the prisoner was staying at Hayman Island. He was not on holidays; he was working.  
     
      
    69 On or about 15 January 2001 Mr Howard was flown up to Hayman Island at the prisoner’s expense. At Hayman Island the prisoner demanded to know why his Data Advantage claim had not been settled. Mr Howard said that he would need to see documentation in order to assess the claim. The prisoner said that he was having the whole file on the Data Advantage claim forwarded up to him from Sydney and, in particular, he was trying to find a letter from Mr Rodney Adler, which he said confirmed the entitlement of FAI Home Security to a large proportion of the shares in Data Advantage Limited which had been allocated to FAI Insurances. Mr Howard returned to Sydney.  
     
      
    70 The prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard dated 15 January 2001, which had many attachments. In the facsimile transmission the prisoner claimed that 85 per cent of the shares allocated to FAI Insurances were the property of HSI, “because we owned the company (FAI Finance Corporation) for 85 per cent of the period that the benefit was gained”. In this facsimile transmission the prisoner was not seeking to draw any distinction between HSI and FAI Home Security. In the facsimile transmission the prisoner claimed that he had spoken to Mr Adler and that Mr Adler was in total agreement with the prisoner. 
     
      
    71 After Mr Howard returned from his holiday at Noosa the prisoner told him in a telephone conversation that the prisoner had “retrieved from archives the letter from Rodney Adler confirming that the Data Advantage shares should have been transferred to FAI Home Security”. 
     
      
    72 On 30 January 2001 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard. The facsimile transmission commenced:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The attached letter retrieved from archives… completes your file… the file and all correspondence clearly confirms HIH have an asset in Data Advantage shares of which 80 per cent belongs to HSI”. 
        
       
      
    73 The attached letter said to have been retrieved from archives was a letter bearing a date 2 August 1999, signed by Mr Rodney Adler. The letter was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Further to our telephone conversation to-day, I have, as requested, reviewed the entire file in regard to FFC (FAI Finance Corporation) and the Data Advantage issue. It is as I thought, without question, an oversight on our part. 
        
       
       
        
        Understanding that this is a material issue to HSI, I am pleased to once again re-confirm that FAI Insurance should have reallocated a large percentage of the value of the Data Advantage shares that were issued to FAI (Insurances), not redistributed back to FFC and per the activity report from Data Advantage which clearly confirms that these shares were the property of FFC and based on pro rata activity HSI should have immediately received the value of this asset. This is an internal error but obviously self-explanatory when one looks at the file. 
        
       
       
        
        Please feel free to include the above in your audit or end of year profit calculations. This should resolve the issue for once and for all as it previously, and still does, have my full approval”. 
        
       
      
    74 It is convenient to refer to this letter as “the Adler letter”. 
     
      
    75 At the trial the Crown proved that the only reasonable conclusions to be drawn from a number of circumstances were that the Adler letter, so far from being a genuine letter brought into existence on or about 2 August 1999 and retrieved from archives, had been created at the instance of the prisoner in January 2001; that on 24 January 2001, on the instructions of the prisoner, the letter had been faxed by a personal assistant of the prisoner to Mr Adler for signature by Mr Adler; that the letter had been signed by Mr Adler and returned on 29 January 2001; that the signed letter had been copied, with care being taken to mask a fax imprint so as not to disclose that the letter had only just been received from Mr Adler; and that the copy of the letter had then been forwarded to Mr Howard with the facsimile transmission of 30 January 2001. 
     
      
    76 The statement in the facsimile transmission of 30 January 2001 to Mr Howard that the attached letter had been retrieved from archives was false and is the subject of the eleventh count in the indictment. 
     
      
    77 The prisoner sought legal advice in relation to the Data Advantage claim from Mr Simon Rofe, solicitor, of Browne and Co Solicitors. Instructions were given to Mr Rofe on 7 February 2001 and a written advice was received from Mr Rofe the same day. Unsurprisingly, in view of the instructions Mr Rofe was given about the facts, Mr Rofe’s advice was favourable to the prisoner. On 7 February 2001 a copy of Mr Rofe’s advice was sent by the prisoner to Mr Howard.  
     
      
    78 In his written advice of 7 February 2001 Mr Rofe said inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 2 August 1999 agreement was reached between yourself and Rodney Adler (representing FAI Insurances) that 80 per cent of the gross value of these shares would be paid by FAI Insurance to FHS (FAI Home Security) to rectify this situation and in recognition that FHS ought to have received its pro rata share of the value of the Data Advantage shares when initially allocated”. 
        
       
      
    79 The statement that on 2 August 1999 agreement had been reached between the prisoner and Rodney Adler was false, because no such agreement had been reached. 
     
      
    80 This statement was, of course, contained in an advice by Mr Rofe and not in a letter or facsimile transmission from the prisoner. However, by sending a copy of Mr Rofe’s advice to Mr Howard, the prisoner published to HIH and HIH C&G the statement in the advice. 
     
      
    81 Mr Rofe, obviously, did not have any independent knowledge of whether such an agreement had been made between the prisoner and Mr Adler. In stating in his advice that such an agreement had been made Mr Rofe was simply repeating instructions he had received, directly or indirectly, from the prisoner. 
     
      
    82 This false statement in Mr Rofe’s advice, which was published by the prisoner to HIH C&G, is the subject of the twelfth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    83 Just before Mr Howard left on an overseas business trip to the United States on 14 February 2001 the prisoner and Mr Howard had a conversation in which it was agreed that the Data Advantage claim would be settled for $1m. When Mr Howard arrived at his hotel in San Francisco, there was a fax from the prisoner waiting for him, demanding payment of the $1m by the end of the week. Mr Howard gave instructions to a member of the HIH staff in Sydney to arrange payment of $1m and the payment was made. 
     
      
       
      Count 13 
       
      
    84 In February 2001 HIH held 126,000 shares in a company called Publicard Inc. Publicard was an American company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange in America. 
     
      
    85 On 23 February 2001 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard. In this facsimile transmission the prisoner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This letter is to confirm that I offer to purchase your entire shareholding in Publicard. 
        
       
       
        
        The stock is down some 78 per cent from its year high and falling significantly on a daily basis. My offer is to pay 65 per cent of to-day’s value, with an immediate cash payment (payable by courier to-day) for your 126,000 shares, the value being $163,800. 
        
       
       
        
        Would you please confirm your immediate acceptance by signing and returning by facsimile”. 
        
       
      
    86 It is to be noted that in the fax there is a dollar sign before the figure 163,800 but no symbol indicating whether American dollars or Australian dollars are meant. In February and March 2001 the Australian dollar was worth only just over half an American dollar, so that there would have been a considerable difference between 163,800 American dollars and 163,800 Australian dollars. 
     
      
    87 After receiving this facsimile transmission from the prisoner, Mr Howard made an inquiry and ascertained that the current value of a share in Publicard was 2 US dollars. 
     
      
    88 Mr Howard decided to accept the prisoner’s offer. He wrote on a copy of the facsimile transmission “accept US$1.20 @ 0.525 exchange rate = A$288,000” and he faxed this copy of the prisoner’s facsimile transmission back to the prisoner. 
     
      
    89 The figure of .525 written by Mr Howard was the current exchange rate of the Australian dollar with the American dollar. However, in calculating the amount of the prisoner’s offer in Australian dollars, Mr Howard had made an arithmetical error. Sixty-five per cent of the current value in American dollars of $2 would have been $1.30 American dollars and not $1.20 American dollars, with the consequence that the total of Australian dollars 288,000 was wrong. 
     
      
    90 Mr Howard’s mistake in treating $1.20 as being 65 per cent of $2 was picked up by Ms Wanda Guff, an employee of HIH or FAI Insurances. Ms Guff saw Mr Howard about the mistake. Mr Howard corrected the figure “US $1.20” to “US $1.30” and Ms Guff altered the total to “A$ 312,000”. The prisoner’s office was notified that the amount of the prisoner’s offer had been calculated by HIH to be A$ 312,000.  
     
      
    91 On 26 February 2001 Wanda Guff sent a fax to the prisoner on the subject of Publicard. In the first sentence of the fax she said “I’ve tried to ring you in regards to delivery of 126,000 shares in Publicard Inc for a consideration of $US 163,800”. 
     
      
    92 Mr Premutico, a personal assistant of the prisoner, made notes for the prisoner, which were promptly submitted to the prisoner, including a note that on 26 February 2001 the prisoner’s accountant Mr Ferguson had transferred $312,000 to HIH for the Publicard shares. 
     
      
    93 On 12 March 2001 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard. The first paragraph of the facsimile transmission began:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As you know I purchased HIH’s 120,000 shares in Publicard approximately 7 days ago. Call it my own naivety, but I was shocked to find out there was no market in the stock and that any attempt to resell these shares would force the price well below 1 dollar…” 
        
       
      
    94 It had become apparent to the prisoner that he had made a very bad investment in purchasing the Publicard shares. 
     
      
    95 In a telephone conversation with Mr Howard on 12 March 2001 the prisoner claimed, for the first time, that his offer had been to purchase the Publicard shares for $163,800 Australian dollars and not $163,800 American dollars.  
     
      
    96 On 13 March 2001 the prisoner sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Howard. In the facsimile transmission the prisoner claimed that “a most embarrassing situation has arisen. I have just reviewed my correspondence from last week and realised that my negotiation with you in regard to the Publicard purchase has gone horribly wrong”. The prisoner stated that, having studied his letter of offer of 23 February 2001, “my offer outlined in paragraph 2 was to purchase your 126,000 shares in Publicard a NASDAQ listed stock at AUD 163,800”. The prisoner claimed that his accountant Mr Ferguson had wrongly assumed that the handwritten notes on the letter of offer which had been made by Mr Howard were the prisoner’s notes. The prisoner offered Mr Howard “the option of refunding me the difference being $AUD 148,200 or reversing the total transaction and refunding me $312,000”. The prisoner apologised for what he said had been the confusion at his end and thanked Mr Howard for bringing the matter to the prisoner’s attention. Mr. Howard had not brought the matter to the prisoner’s attention. 
     
      
    97 The prisoner subsequently had a conversation with Mr Howard. In the conversation Mr Howard said, “I still think that we were talking US dollars”. The prisoner said, “no way, my letter clearly says an A$ offer and my accountant has just made a mistake”. The prisoner said, “you can have the shares back or refund the difference” Mr Howard said, “I don’t want the shares back” and Mr Howard eventually said “I am tired of this and I will send you a refund”. 
     
      
    98 A payment of $148,200 was made to the prisoner on 14 March 2001, the day before HIH went into provisional liquidation. 
     
      
    99 The statement in the facsimile transmission of 13 March 2001, “my offer outlined in paragraph 2 was to purchase your 126,000 shares in Publicard a NASDAQ listed stock at AUD $163,800” was false and was the false statement alleged in count 13 in the indictment. 
     
      
    100 There can be no doubt that, as the prisoner well knew, the offer made by the prisoner in his fax of 23 February 2001 was to pay US $163,800. 
     
      
    101 Publicard was an American company listed on an American Stock Exchange on which its price was quoted in American dollars and it would be natural for “to-day’s value” to be the price in American dollars. 
     
      
    102 The value of Publicard shares in American dollars as at 23 February 2001, the date of the offer, was $2 and 65 per cent of that value per share, times 126,000 shares, would produce a figure of US$163,800, which was the amount of the offer stated in the prisoner’s fax of 23 February 2001. 
     
      
    103 The fax sent by Ms Guff and the notes made by the prisoner’s personal assistant confirm that the prisoner was well aware in February 2001 that the amount he had offered was $US 163,800.  
     
      
    104 It was absurd for the prisoner to claim, as he did in his fax of 13 March, that his accountant, who had worked for him for a number of years and who would have been familiar with his handwriting, had mistakenly assumed that Mr Howard’s handwritten notes had been made by the prisoner. 
     
      
    105 Even the second limb of the offer made by the prisoner in his fax of 13 March, namely reversing the total transaction and refunding AUD $312,000, presupposed that the amount of the offer had been US $163,800. 
     
      
    106 Mr Howard well knew that the price offered and accepted had been $US 163,800. In the last conversation he had with the prisoner on this subject he said “I still think that we were talking US dollars”. However, so compromised was Mr Howard by the bribes he had accepted, that he weakly submitted to the prisoner’s absurd claim. 
     
      
    107 Although Mr Howard was not deceived by the false statement, the false statement was intended by the prisoner to deceive other officers or employees of HIH who in the course of their duties might see the facsimile transmission of 13 March. 
     
      
       
      Loss and Damage to HIH 
       
      
    108 It was an element of each of the bribery offences that the expectation or the receipt of a benefit offered or given to Mr Howard would have tended to influence Mr Howard to show favour to the prisoner’s companies in the processing of their claims. 109 The Crown made the submission in the proceedings on sentence that the expectation or the receipt of benefits had in fact influenced Mr Howard to show favour to the prisoner’s companies in the processing of their claims, thereby causing loss and damage to HIH and that this should be regarded as a significant factor in the sentencing of the prisoner. 
     
      
    110 It was submitted by the Crown that all, or almost all, of the claims by the prisoner’s companies lacked any foundation and Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed that HIH should pay anything in settlement of the claims or at least would not have agreed that HIH should pay as much as Mr Howard agreed it should. 
     
      
    111 It will be necessary to consider each of the claims individually, in order to determine whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Howard, if he had not been offered or given bribes, would not have agreed to pay any amount in settlement of the claim or would not have agreed to settle the claim for as high an amount as he did. 112 Before commencing my examination of the individual claims, I should refer to some general submissions made by counsel for the prisoner. 
     
      
    113 It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that I should take into account that Mr Howard had been instructed to endeavour to achieve a divorce between HIH and the prisoner’s companies, as soon as possible, and that I should find, as I do, that the prisoner was, quite apart from his criminal conduct, an aggressive and persistent negotiator. It was submitted that in these circumstances Mr Howard, even if he had not been bribed, might have settled claims by the prisoner’s companies on terms which might appear favourable to those companies. I take these submissions by counsel for the prisoner into account. 
     
      
    114 It was also submitted by counsel for the prisoner that the funds provided to the prisoner’s companies in settlement of their claims assisted FAI Home Security, which was in serious financial trouble, to survive, If FAI Home Security had not survived, there could have been adverse financial consequences for HIH. FAI Home Security had survived and had then been sold to the Chubb organisation. After the sale, monies which FAI Finance Corporation had advanced to FAI Home Security were repaid to FAI Finance Corporation, thereby benefiting HIH. 
     
      
    115 The Crown replied to these submissions by pointing out that between December 2000 and March 2001 HIH had itself been in grave financial difficulty, with a desperate shortage of cash. It was also submitted by the Crown that the claims the prisoner made on behalf of his companies were not put forward by him on the grounds that settling the claims would indirectly benefit HIH but on other, and, the Crown submitted, entirely spurious grounds. 
     
      
    116 It is very difficult for me, on the limited evidence available to me, to form any view on whether the payments made by HIH really contributed to the survival of FAI Home Security and whether, and, if so, to what extent, the survival of FAI Home Security was advantageous to HIH. I do, however, take these submissions into account. 
     
      
    117 I will deal first with the claims by the prisoner’s companies which I have already considered in these remarks, that is the first Vision Publishing claim, the second Vision Publishing or the Goodwill Group claim, the Data Advantage claim and the Publicard claim. 
     
      
       
        
        The First Vision Publishing Claim 
        
       
      
    118 As I have already stated earlier in these remarks, Mr Richardson in his memorandum of 21 March 2000 said that HIH had agreed to sponsor in the amount of $1,200,000 seminars to be produced by Vision Publishing. However, Mr Richardson added “details of this sponsorship will need to be finalised directly with HIH”. 
     
      
    119 It is clear that no seminars were ever held and that no details of the sponsorship were ever finalised with HIH. 
     
      
    120 In his letter of 3 January 2001 to Mr Howard Mr Williams said, “clearly we cannot pay over the sponsorship fee without full details of what is now proposed and, most importantly, when the event will be staged”. As I have already explained, unbeknown to Mr Williams, the sponsorship claim had already been discharged in full. However, Mr Williams’ caveat against making any payment, unless full details of what was proposed were supplied to HIH, was in accordance with the addendum to Mr Richardson’s memorandum and would, in any event, seem to me to be common sense. 
     
      
    121 I am satisfied that Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed to pay any amount on the first Vision Publishing claim. 
     
      
       
        
        The Second Vision Publishing or the Goodwill Group Claim  
        
       
      
    122 In the light of the jury’s verdicts of guilty on counts 7 to 10, it was conceded by counsel for the prisoner in the proceedings on sentence that this claim was completely lacking in any foundation and known by Mr Howard to be completely lacking in any foundation. I find that Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed to pay any sum. 
     
      
       
      The Data Advantage Claim 
       
      
    123 The Data Advantage claim made by the prisoner was supported by the Adler letter which the prisoner had allegedly obtained from archives and by a legal opinion from Mr Rofe. Mr Howard did not know that the Adler letter had only recently been fabricated by the prisoner. However, in February 2001 Mr Howard already doubted the veracity of Mr Adler.  
     
      
    124 The prisoner’s claim that FAI Home Security was entitled to a large percentage of the shares in Data Advantage Limited which had been allocated to FAI Insurances was based on a premise that between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1997 a large proportion or all of the shares in FAI Finance Corporation had been held by FAI Home Security. However this premise was untrue, as would have been readily discoverable by Mr Howard. Between 1 October 1994 and 30 September 1997 shares in FAI Finance Corporation were held by FAI Home Security, only for a short period between 1 October 1994 and February 1995. Between February 1995 and 30 September 1997 all shares in FAI Finance Corporation were held by FAI Insurances and no shares in FAI Finance Corporation were held by FAI Home Security. Consequently, any claim by FAI Home Security to the shares in Data Advantage Limited would have been far less than any of the claims which were made at various times by the prisoner, for example claims to 50 per cent or 80 per cent or 85 per cent of the shares in Data Advantage Limited which had been allocated to FAI Insurances. 
     
      
    125 Furthermore, in a sale completed in about March 2000 FAI Home Security had sold to HIH the shares it then held in FAI Finance Corporation. I am satisfied that any claim which FAI Home Security might have had to shares in Data Advantage Limited was taken into account in negotiating the sale price on the sale of the shares and that any such claim passed on completion of the sale from FAI Home Security to HIH. That was also the view taken by Mr MacDonnell, the Chief Operating Officer of HSI, who conveyed that view to the prisoner in November 2000. 
     
      
    126 The fact that the prisoner resorted to fabricating the Adler letter suggests that the prisoner was well aware of the spuriousness of the claim.  
     
      
    127 Before agreeing to settle the claim, Mr Howard obtained his own legal advice on the Data Advantage claim and the advice he received did not support accepting the claim.  
     
      
    128 I am satisfied that Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed to pay any sum. 
     
      
       
      The Publicard Shares Claim  
       
      
    129 Counsel for the prisoner pointed to evidence given by Mr Howard at the trial in which he said that he had finally submitted to the prisoner’s claim, because he was tired of the matter and because there were greater issues at HIH. However, the claim was completely lacking in any foundation and known by Mr Howard to be completely lacking in any foundation and I am satisfied that Mr. Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed to pay any sum. 
     
      
    130 I will now deal, fairly succinctly, with other claims made by the prisoner on behalf of companies associated with the prisoner, which were settled by Mr. Howard. 
     
      
       
        
        The Claim for Compensation for Refurbishment Expenses and Relocation Expenses 
        
       
      
    131 For some years companies associated with the prisoner were sub-lessees of parts of an office building at North Sydney. The sub-lessor was FAI Insurances or a company associated with FAI Insurances, which was itself a head lessee. The prisoner claimed that his companies had originally entered into the sub-leases at the request of Mr Adler.  
     
      
    132 In 1995 and 1996 companies associated with the prisoner had incurred expenditure in refurbishing parts of the leased premises.  
     
      
    133 In the year 2000 the owner of the building was terminating the leases of tenants. The prisoner made a claim to Mr Howard to be compensated for the costs of the refurbishment in 1995-1996 and the costs of relocating his businesses elsewhere. The claim made by the prisoner was settled by Mr Howard for $275,000. 
     
      
    134 I am satisfied that, if Mr Howard had not been bribed, he would not have agreed to pay any amount. There was no legal obligation on HIH or FAI Insurances to compensate the prisoner’s companies for either the refurbishment expenses or the relocation expenses. Furthermore, the prisoner’s companies owed more than $800,000 in arrears of rent and, even if any claim, legal or commercial, existed, the claim would have been rejected by Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, on the basis that a much larger sum in arrears of rent was owing by the prisoner’s companies. 
     
      
       
      Claim for Legal Costs 
       
      
    135 The prisoner claimed to be reimbursed the amount of legal costs his companies had incurred on a number of transactions the prisoner’s companies had entered into with HIH or members of the HIH group. The claim was settled by Mr. Howard for $92,000.  
     
      
    136 I am satisfied that there was no legal basis for the claim and that Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have agreed to pay any amount. 
     
      
       
      The Ness Payment Claim 
       
      
    137 On 27 September 2000 a deal summary between HIH and HSI was signed by Mr Williams on behalf of HIH and Mr Adler, who had just become the Chief Executive Officer of HSI. Part of par 3 of the deal summary read:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIH will provide HSI with a further $A2.5m of funds by 30 June 2001”. 
        
       
      
    138 In December 2000 and early January 2001 the prisoner pressed Mr Howard for early payment of the sum of $2.5m.  
     
      
    139 In early January 2001 Mr Howard had a conversation with the prisoner. The conversation was to the following effect:- 
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner said, “you know we need the $2.5m, when can you make a payment?” Mr Howard said, “but that’s not due until June 2001”. The prisoner said “read the term sheet, Bill. It says by June 2001”. 
        
       
      
    140 Mr Howard read the deal summary or term sheet again and in a later conversation said to the prisoner “yes, you are right, I shall organise payment this week”. 
     
      
    141 The amount of $2.5m was paid by HIH C&G on 5 January 2001.  
     
      
    142 It is true that HIH had by the term in the deal summary bound itself to provide HSI with $2.5m. However, by the term in the deal summary the money was to be provided “by 30 June 2001”. Mr Howard was clearly right in saying in his conversation with the prisoner in early January 2001 that the money was not due until June 2001. I am satisfied that Mr Howard submitted to the prisoner and agreed to make an early payment of the full amount, only because he had been bribed. 
     
      
    143 Because by the term in the deal summary an amount of $2.5m would have become due by 30 June 2001, Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, might have agreed to an early payment, provided that the amount of the payment was discounted to allow for the early payment, even though any early payment would have been disadvantageous to HIH because of its shortage of cash. 
     
      
    144 In dealing with the Ness payment claim I have not sought to deal with the difficult question of whether the paragraph in the deal summary survived two formal agreements entered into in December 2000. 
     
      
       
      Discount Rebate Claim 
       
      
    145 The background to the discount rebate claim is complicated and I do not propose to endeavour to state it fully in these remarks. 
     
      
    146 FAI Finance Corporation in financing credit sales of alarm systems by FAI Home Security withheld from FAI Home Security what was described as a discount or a rebate. 
     
      
    147 According to evidence given at the trial by Mr Jurd, the General Manager of FAI Finance Corporation, the rate of discount ordinarily charged was 18 per cent. For a period of three months in the year 2000, which was then extended for a further month, the rate of discount withheld by FAI Finance Corporation was reduced to 15 per cent. FAI Finance Corporation then reverted to withholding a discount at the rate of 18 per cent. 
     
      
    148 A paragraph in the deal summary of 27 September 2000 between HIH and HSI provided that the discount rate would be 15 per cent for the twelve months to 30 September 2001. 
     
      
    149 The prisoner made a claim on behalf of FAI Home Security with respect to the discount being withheld by FAI Finance Corporation. 
     
      
    150 In December 2000 Mr Howard asked Mr Jurd to make calculations of the difference between the total amount of a discount at 18 per cent and the total amount of a discount at 15 per cent for the twelve months to 30 September 2001. Mr Howard asked Mr Jurd to make two calculations. For the first calculation he was asked by Mr. Howard to make the assumption that in the twelve months to 30 September 2001 FAI Home Security would sell 1200 units per month. For the second calculation he was asked to assume that FAI Home Security would sell 1500 units per month.151 Mr Jurd protested to Mr Howard against the assumptions he was being asked to make, on the grounds that FAI Home Security was currently selling each month less than the lower figure of 1200 units. Mr Howard persisted in asking Mr Jurd to do the calculations, using the assumptions Mr. Howard has asked him to make. 
     
      
    152 Mr Jurd did the calculations, on the assumptions he had been asked by Mr Howard to make. On the assumption that FAI Home Security would be selling 1200 units per month, Mr Jurd’s calculations produced a figure of $2,349,356. On the assumption that FAI Home Security would be selling 1500 units per month, Mr Jurd’s calculations produced a figure of $2,936,696. 
     
      
    153 Mr Howard had a conversation with the prisoner in which he proposed a one-off payment in settlement of the discount rebate claim. The prisoner and Mr Howard agreed to settle the discount rebate claim for $2.7m, which was a figure in between the two figures calculated by Mr Jurd, and this amount was paid on 22 December 2000. I accept the submission made by the Crown that it is no coincidence that this payment was made at about the same time as Mr Howard received the first payment of a bribe. 
     
      
    154 The prisoner’s company was entitled to be paid some amount for the discount rebate claim, if only to compensate FAI Home Security in respect of the period in which, contrary to the term in the deal summary, a rebate of 18 per cent and not 15 per cent had been withheld by FAI Finance Corporation. However, there was no justification for Mr Howard arranging for the prisoner’s company to be paid in December 2000 an undiscounted sum representing the difference between a discount at the rate of 18 per cent and a discount at the rate of 15 per cent for the twelve months to 30 September 2001. 
     
      
    155 If an amount was to be calculated as representing the difference between the estimated total amount of discount at 18 per cent and the estimated total amount of discount at 15 per cent for the twelve months to 30 September 2001, then realistic assumptions should have been used as to the number of units per month FAI Home Security would be likely to sell. Mr Howard was expressly told by Mr Jurd that the assumptions Mr Howard was asking Mr Jurd to make were unrealistic. 
     
      
    156 At the trial Mr MacDonnell, HSI’s Chief Operations Manager up to about November 2000, produced monthly management reports showing that between July 2000 and October 2000 sales by FAI Home Security had never reached as high as 1200 units. 
     
      
    157 Although some amount would have been properly payable to FAI Home Security for the discount rebate claim, the claim would not have been settled so favourably for FAI Home Security, if Mr Howard had not been bribed. 
     
      
       
      The Introduction Fee  
       
      
    158 HIH had a property portfolio, that is it owned a number of pieces of real estate. 
     
      
    159 In late 2000 and early 2001 HIH was in a liquidity crisis, which might possibly be alleviated by a quick sale of the properties in the property portfolio. 
     
      
    160 The prisoner had a conversation with Mr Howard in which the prisoner said that a property developer might be interested in acquiring HIH’s property portfolio. 
     
      
    161 On 14 February 2001 there was a meeting between Mr Howard, the prisoner and Mr Ben Tilley, who was friendly with Mr. Kerry Packer. At the meeting Mr Tilley said that Mr Kerry Packer might be interested in acquiring the property portfolio at the right price.  
     
      
    162 Subsequently, Mr Howard told the prisoner that the prisoner and Mr Tilley would have to speak to Mr Wein, the new Chief Executive Officer of HIH, about the property portfolio and the prisoner did speak to Mr Wein. 
     
      
    163 On 2 March 2001 there was a meeting at the offices of Consolidated Press, which was attended by representatives of Consolidated Press (as so described by Mr. Howard in his evidence), Mr Tilley and Mr Wein and Mr Howard representing HIH. The HIH representatives told the meeting that HIH would be interested in selling the properties in the portfolio in one line at a discount of about 40 per cent. It was agreed at the meeting that the legal representatives of the parties would confer.  
     
      
    164 After the meeting the prisoner asked Mr Howard whether HIH would consider a fee for “getting Kerry Packer to the table and doing a deal”. Mr Howard said that he saw that as feasible and he asked the prisoner to forward a document.  
     
      
    165 The prisoner sent Mr Howard a document in the form of a draft agreement, which included a term that HIH would pay a success fee/commission to Mr Tilley of US$2m. Mr Howard had a conversation with the prisoner in which he said that the fee proposed by the prisoner was too high. 
     
      
    166 Mr Tilley was overseas between the week-end of 3-4 March 2001 and 16 March 2001. While he was overseas, the prisoner represented Mr Tilley and himself. 
     
      
    167 On 7 March 2001 HIH exercised a put option. A consequence of HIH exercising the option was that it became doubtful whether a number of properties in the property portfolio were available to be sold by HIH. 
     
      
    168 On 7 March 2001 the prisoner sent a fax to Mr Howard in which he purported to “reconfirm” that he and Mr Tilley would themselves purchase the Toshiba building and an industrial site at Auburn, which were the two best properties in the property portfolio, while continuing to claim “an intermediary fee” of $2m plus 10 per cent GST. 
     
      
    169 Mr Howard had not agreed that the prisoner and Mr Tilley could purchase the Toshiba building and the industrial site. What HIH was trying to do was to sell all the properties in one line to Mr. Packer’s company. 
     
      
    170 When told by Mr Howard that HIH had exercised the put option and that, consequently, certain properties in the portfolio might not be available for sale, the prisoner claimed that an option to purchase had been given by HIH over the properties in the property portfolio and the prisoner threatened legal action. 
     
      
    171 At a Board meeting of HIH held on Sunday 11 March 2001 Mr Howard reported to the Board that there was a fee payable to an intermediary for getting Kerry Packer to the table, that the fee being demanded was too high and that Mr Howard was still negotiating the amount of the fee. 
     
      
    172 Further negotiations took place and Mr Howard agreed to the following remuneration for the prisoner and Mr Tilley:- 
     
      
       
      1. An immediate payment of US$1m. 
       
       
      2. A further payment of US $250,000 “when the sales from the Packer Group exchange on contracts that exceed A $20m”  
       
       
      3. A commission of 2.5 per cent on all sales, payable by HIH at the time of exchange of contracts. 
       
      
    173 Mr Howard took a fax setting out this remuneration to Mr Wein and made a written note to the effect that Mr Wein had agreed to the remuneration. At the time Mr. Howard saw Mr. Wein, Mr. Wein was distracted by a telephone call. 
     
      
    174 An amount of $1,965,408.80 being the Australian equivalent, at the then exchange rate, of US $1m was paid by HIH C&G on 14 March 2001, which was the day before HIH went into provisional liquidation. The amount paid by HIH C&G was shared by the prisoner and Mr. Tilley. 
     
      
    175 It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner, that, even if there had not been any legal obligation, it was reasonable for Mr Howard to agree to pay a fee to the prisoner and Mr Tilley “to get Mr Packer to the table”, that is to obtain access to, and negotiate with, Mr Packer or his representatives. Mr Packer was a man of enormous wealth, who would be able to make a speedy cash purchase of the properties in the property portfolio. Access had in fact been obtained at a time when Mr Packer was ill in hospital. If the property portfolio had been sold to Mr. Packer’s company, the benefit to HIH could have been substantial. Mr Howard had consulted his superiors, Mr Wein and Mr Abbott, who was a member of the HIH Board, and they had instructed him to proceed.176 Notwithstanding the submissions by counsel for the prisoner, I have concluded, for a number of reasons, that, while it might have been commercially reasonable for Mr. Howard to have agreed that some amount should be paid, Mr. Howard agreed to such a large remuneration, only because he had been bribed by the prisoner. 
     
      
    177 The amount which was agreed to be paid and which was paid, was exorbitant. US $1m at the then exchange rate was almost A $2m. 
     
      
    178 The amount of US $1m was paid, not as a success fee, but merely as an introduction fee. Under the agreement this amount was payable, regardless of whether any sales were made. 
     
      
    179 It was the prisoner who nominated the kind of level of fee which should be payable, by claiming in the document sent after the meeting at Consolidated Press on 2 March a success fee/commission of US $2m. 
     
      
    180 The prisoner first asked Mr Howard whether HIH would consider a fee for getting Kerry Packer to the table and doing a deal, after the meeting at Consolidated Press, that is after the service of getting Kerry Packer to the table had already been performed, which should have strengthened Mr Howard’s bargaining position. 
     
      
    181 What HIH wished to do was to offer all of the properties in the property portfolio, in one line, to Mr. Packer. However, before the remuneration was agreed, the prisoner had informed Mr Howard that the prisoner and Mr Tilley intended to acquire for themselves the two best properties in the portfolio.  
     
      
       
      
    182 It was apparent to Mr Howard, after the exercise of the put option on 7 March, that it was unlikely that the proposed sale of all of the properties could proceed. 
     
      
    183 Insofar as Mr Wein and Mr Abbott might have given any approval, they were heavily reliant on such information as they had been given by Mr Howard and I find that Mr. Howard manipulated Mr. Wein. 
     
      
    184 By the time the terms of the remuneration were agreed, it was known that Mr. Packer’s company, having investigated the properties, was no longer interested and that there would be no sales. 
     
      
    185 The terms of remuneration were agreed at a time when HIH was in a desperate financial position and the payment of nearly A $2m was made, at Mr Howard’s behest and as a matter of urgency, on the day before the provisional liquidator was appointed. 
     
      
       
      The Kirby Costs Claim 
       
      
    186 The facts of this claim are extremely complicated and I do not propose to go into them. There is no doubt that the prisoner acted dishonestly in his negotiations with Mr Howard. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Howard, if he had not been bribed, would not have settled the claim for the amount for which he did, $560,000. 
     
      
       
        
        Summary 
         
        
       
      
    187 I summarise this part of these remarks by saying that, if Mr. Howard had not been bribed, he would not have agreed that any amount should be paid for the first Vision Publishing claim, the second Vision Publishing claim, the Data Advantage claim, the Publicard shares claim, the claim for compensation for refurbishment expenses and relocation expenses and the claim for legal costs. If Mr. Howard had not been bribed, he would not have agreed that as much should be paid as he agreed should be paid, for the Ness payment claim, the discount rebate claim and the introduction fee claim. 
     
      
    188 In settling the various claims Mr Howard, because he had been bribed, made no attempt to offset amounts due by companies associated with the prisoner by way of outstanding rent on the leased premises at North Sydney or amounts due under a joint venture agreement with FAI Insurances Limited pursuant to which shares in Publicard Inc had originally been acquired. 
     
      
    189 As a consequence of Mr. Howard in fact showing favour to the prisoner’s companies in the processing of their claims, HIH suffered substantial damage. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Features 
       
      
    190 As already remarked, the prisoner did not give evidence either at the trial or in the proceedings on sentence. Some information about the prisoner is contained in a pre-sentence report, some character references which were admitted into evidence and some other documents. 
     
      
    191 The prisoner was born on 6 May 1959 and is accordingly forty-seven years old. He is one of three children. He has maintained contact with his mother and with his brother and sister. The prisoner left school at the age of fifteen and did not undertake any tertiary studies. 
     
      
    192 He commenced carrying on the business which became FAI Home Security many years ago. By extremely hard work and considerable business acumen he succeeded in creating a successful business. However, by the year 2000 the business was seriously declining and the prisoner was striving to keep the business afloat.  
     
      
    193 The prisoner has had a partner for some years and she has regularly visited him while he has been in custody.  
     
      
    194 The prisoner is now bankrupt and without any assets. 
     
      
    195 While in custody the prisoner has been receiving medication for high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels.  
     
      
    196 I will refer to certain other subjective features of the prisoner later in these remarks. 
     
      
       
      Factors in Sentencing 
       
       
      Objective Criminality 
      
    197 The prisoner offered to bribe Mr. Howard and bribes were given by the prisoner to Mr Howard on five separate occasions, the total amount being approximately $119,000 or approximately $124,000. The prisoner made the offer and made the payments with the intention of corrupting Mr Howard, that is with the intention of influencing Mr Howard to show favour to the prisoner’s companies. I have found that Mr Howard was in fact corrupted by the offer and the payments.  
     
      
    198 I have found that the claims by the prisoner’s companies which I have described as the first Vision Publishing claim, the second Vision Publishing claim, the Data Advantage claim, the Publicard shares claim, the legal expenses claim and the refurbishment and relocation expenses claim were without any foundation, and were known by both the prisoner and Mr Howard to be without any foundation and that, if Mr Howard had not been bribed, he would not have agreed to settle the claims for any amount and no amount would have been paid out by HIH C&G. 
     
      
    199 Claims which Mr Howard might have settled at some figure, if he had not been bribed, but which, because he had been bribed, were settled on terms which were excessively favourable to the prisoner’s companies and unfavourable to HIH were the claims I have described as the discount rebate claim, the Ness payment claim and the introduction fee claim. 
     
      
    200 The first four of the false statement offences (counts 7 to 10 in the indictment) all involved making false statements to the effect that the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim had not been satisfied, when the prisoner well knew that it had been satisfied. 
     
      
    201 These false statements did not deceive Mr Howard, who knew the true position. However, the prisoner knew that the false statements could be used by Mr Howard to deceive other employees or officers of HIH or HIH C&G into believing that the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim had not been satisfied. 
     
      
    202 The false statements in counts 11 and 12 were false statements to the effect that an agreement had been made on 2 August 1999 between the prisoner and Mr Adler representing FAI Insurances that 80 per cent of the value of the shares in Data Advantage Limited which had been allocated to FAI Insurances should be paid to FAI Home Security and that a letter sent to Mr. Howard recording this alleged agreement had been retrieved from archives. The prisoner knew that these statements were false. He knew that the letter which he alleged had been retrieved from archives had been fabricated by him in January 2001. 
     
      
    203 The prisoner knew that the false statement the subject of count 13 was false and that he had no entitlement whatever to payment of the sum of $148,200. 
     
      
    204 Mr Howard was not deceived by this false statement because Mr Howard, also, knew that the statement was false. However, the prisoner knew that the false statement could be used by Mr Howard to deceive other employees or officers of HIH into believing that a payment by HIH C&G of $148,200 was warranted. 
     
      
    205 The aggravating factors referred to in paragraphs (g) and (n) of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present. 
     
      
    206 As to (g) the damage caused by the offences was substantial. The damage was aggravated because, as the prisoner knew, HIH was in desperate financial straits and was desperately short of cash. 
     
      
    207 As to (n) the offences were planned. The meeting at the Hotel on Sunday 3 December 2000 was arranged by the prisoner. I am satisfied that the prisoner intended to offer Mr. Howard a bribe at the meeting. The offer to “look after” Mr Howard was not the result of a spur of the moment decision taken at the meeting. The false statement offences were committed in the course of carefully planned and executed criminal schemes. 
     
      
    208 As to paragraph (k) of s 21A(2), the prisoner did not commit any direct breach of trust in that he was not a director, an officer or an employee of HIH or of any company which was a member of the HIH group of companies. However, the prisoner was complicit in breaches of trust by Mr Howard. Mr Howard was a senior officer of HIH C&G and the prisoner offered a bribe and gave bribes to Mr. Howard with the intention of procuring Mr Howard to commit breaches of trust and the prisoner’s conduct had that consequence. The knowingly false statements made by the prisoner were made with the intent of procuring or assisting Mr Howard to commit breaches of trust. 
     
      
       
        
        Deterrence 
        
       
      
    209 It was submitted by the Crown, and I accept, that there is a need for the sentences I impose to give effect to the sentencing purpose of general deterrence. The offences were planned and, before committing each offence, the prisoner would have had the opportunity of weighing up the advantages and disadvantages to him of committing the offence. 
     
      
    210 There is a need for general deterrence in sentencing for offences of bribery. Bribery is an offence which is difficult to detect, difficult to investigate and difficult to prove. The present offences of bribery became capable of being proved, only because Mr Howard, after a long period of strenuously denying that he had been guilty of any wrongdoing, admitted his guilt and agreed to provide assistance to law enforcement authorities, including giving evidence against the prisoner. In the present case the bribery offences involved the corrupting of a senior officer of a company. 
     
      
       
        
        Mitigating Factors 
        
       
      
    211 It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that a number of mitigating factors within s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present. 
     
      
    212 I accept that the prisoner has no criminal record (par (e)), that the prisoner is a person of previous good character (par (f)), that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend (par (g)) and that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation (par (h)).  
     
      
    213 As to the prisoner’s previous good character, I accept that the evidence goes beyond a mere absence of criminal convictions. The prisoner has been an extremely hard worker. Evidence was given at the trial and in the proceedings on sentence of a number of acts of generosity by the prisoner to employees and to others. 
     
      
    214 I accept that in the present case the evidence of previous good character is relevant. However, evidence of previous good character is of less weight where, as here, the previous good character has enabled the offender to assume a position where he could commit the offences and it is also of less weight where an offender is to be sentenced for repeated offences committed over a period. 
     
      
    215 I accept that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend but a reason for his being unlikely to re-offend is that he is unlikely ever again to be in a position where he could commit similar offences. 
     
      
    216 The prisoner did provide some assistance within s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the proceedings relating to the offences. However, the assistance provided by the prisoner was limited. The prisoner agreed that at the trial the statements of a number of witnesses could be read, without the makers of the statements being required to give oral evidence, and for the purposes of the trial a limited number of facts were agreed to by the prisoner. 
     
      
    217 On 6 May 2005 I gave certain directions ordering pre-trial disclosure pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. On 24 June 2005 the prisoner’s solicitors wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions supplying the names of a number of witnesses to be called as character witnesses at the trial (none of whom were in fact called) and giving notice of the prisoner’s intention to dispute the admissibility of large parts of the evidence in the Crown brief, including all of the evidence of Mr Howard, the principal Crown witness. 
     
      
    218 It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that the factor in par (i) of s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was present, in that the prisoner had shown remorse by making reparation for damage suffered by HIH. 
     
      
    219 I do not consider that the prisoner has shown any remorse at all for any of the offences. 
     
      
    220 It was submitted that, in any event, the prisoner had made reparation for the damage caused by his offences. Counsel for the prisoner pointed to (1) amounts paid to the liquidator of HIH (2) amounts paid after the sale of FAI Home Security to Chubb. 
     
      
    221 A letter from Mr AG McGrath, the liquidator of HIH, became exhibit 11 in the proceedings on sentence. A set of agreed facts about payments made to the liquidator became exhibit 12 in the proceedings on sentence. The following statement of facts is taken from those exhibits. 
     
      
    222 After Mr McGrath was appointed liquidator, he made a number of demands on the prisoner and companies associated with him. Some of those demands were related to matters I have referred to in these remarks. Some of the demands were unrelated to any matter I have referred to. 
     
      
    223 The prisoner’s solicitors replied, refusing to comply with the liquidator’s demands.  
     
      
    224 The liquidator instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court to enforce the demands. A defence was filed in the Supreme Court proceedings. 
     
      
    225 Negotiations took place between the parties and an agreement was reached. Under heads of agreement dated 3 July 2003 the prisoner was required to pay the sum of $2.5 m by 30 September 2003. A dispute about a comparatively minor amount led to further heads of agreement. 
     
      
    226 An amount of approximately $2.5 m has been paid by the prisoner to the liquidator and Mr McGrath says in his letter that, so far as the liquidator is concerned, the prisoner and the prisoner’s companies have discharged their obligations. 
     
      
    227 It is to be noted that the payments made by the prisoner or his companies were not voluntary; they were made only after court proceedings had been commenced and prosecuted. Furthermore, it appears that at least some of the monies paid to the liquidator were provided, not by the prisoner or any of his companies, but by third persons. 
     
      
    228 Counsel for the prisoner submitted that it was a mitigating factor that the offences had been committed by the prisoner, not out of a motive of personal gain, but out of a motive of obtaining advantages for companies associated with him. 
     
      
    229 I do not consider that it would be a mitigating factor that the prisoner’s motive was, not to obtain advantages for himself, but to obtain advantages for companies associated with him. In any event, the companies were so closely associated with the prisoner that the obtaining of advantages for them amounted to the obtaining of advantages for him. As I have already noted, all the shares in the Goodwill Group Pty Limited and Speak Easy Pty Limited were beneficially owned by the prisoner and all the shares in Vision Publishing were beneficially owned by the Goodwill Group Pty Limited. FAI Home Security was a wholly owned subsidiary of HSI and, by an agreement recorded in a term sheet of 8 December 2000, HIH agreed to sell its shareholding in HSI, with the consequence that the prisoner came to hold over half the shares in HSI.  
     
      
    230 I note that in late 2000 and early 2001 the prisoner did not curtail his extravagant lifestyle, including driving expensive cars, living in a residential apartment at Balmoral, staying at Hayman Island and gambling large sums at a casino. 
     
      
    231 It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that the prisoner has already suffered extra-curial punishment, that is loss or damage quite apart from any sentences I impose, and that I should take this extra-curial punishment into account in sentencing him. 
     
      
    232 I accept that the prisoner has suffered widespread adverse media publicity and public humiliation. I accept that, whatever offences he might have committed, some of the adverse media publicity about him has been unmerited. For example, in some publications he has been described, wrongly, as having been a director or an officer of HIH. He has sometimes been described as a person responsible for the collapse of HIH. On the limited information available to me, that description would appear to be unwarranted. 
     
      
    233 I accept that the prisoner has made the reparation I have already referred to. I also accept that he has no assets and has been made bankrupt and that his convictions for these offences will make it difficult for him to operate commercially or to obtain employment. 
     
      
       
        
        Protection 
         
        
       
      
    234 It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that I should take into account that since he went into custody the prisoner has been on some form of protection and that he may spend the whole or part of his sentence on protection.235 The evidence in the proceeding on sentence included exhibit 13, written answers by the General Manager of the Metropolitan Remand Reception Centre in response to a joint request for information by the prisoner’s legal representatives and the Director of Public Prosecutions and an affidavit by Mr Pezzano, an officer of the Department of Corrective Services. 
     
      
    236 The prisoner went into custody on 31 October 2005, after the jury returned their verdicts of guilty. He was admitted into the Metropolitan Remand Reception Centre at Silverwater. As he has not yet been sentenced, he has remained in the Reception Centre. 
     
      
    237 When the prisoner went into custody he was placed on non-association protection, at his own request, because he said that he feared for his safety. But for his request, he would not have been put on protection. As the prisoner has not given evidence and as there is no other evidence, there is no evidence of any grounds for any fear the prisoner may hold for his safety. 
     
      
    238 Subsequently, at his own request, the prisoner was placed on limited association protection, because he said that he wanted to spend more time out of his cell to prepare his case for this sentence hearing. Subsequently he reverted, at his own request, to non-association protection. The prisoner has decided to remain on protection, until he is sentenced. 
     
      
    239 Once the prisoner has been sentenced, his status will change from that of being a remand prisoner to that of being a sentenced prisoner and he will be transferred from the Remand Centre to a Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    240 According to the evidence in the proceedings on sentence, because the prisoner has been on protection while on remand and because the prisoner is likely to be classified upon being sentenced as being a minimum security inmate, it is likely that, on being sentenced and classified, he will be transferred to one of three particular correctional centres. 
     
      
    241 Two of these centres are populated exclusively by inmates who have previously been on protection and do not have separate areas for protective custody. Inmates at these centres have full association with other inmates, are not confined to their living quarters for any specified period each day and have full access to all facilities and programmes conducted by the Department of Corrective Services. The same statements apply to the third correctional centre, except that it does have some inmates who are on protection and who are separated from other inmates within the centre.242 I take into account that the prisoner as a remand prisoner has, at his own request, been on some form of protective custody. It is difficult to predict in what conditions of custody the prisoner will spend the rest of his sentence and any prediction may not be fulfilled. However, it seems to me unlikely that the prisoner, upon being sentenced and transferred from the Remand Centre, will remain on any form of protective custody. 
     
      
       
      Parity and Proportionality 
       
      
    243 Mr Howard has been sentenced for the offences committed by him. In the present proceedings on sentence it was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that, while there are differences between the prisoner and Mr Howard, the sentences imposed on the prisoner for at least some of his offences should be similar to the sentences which were imposed on Mr Howard or rather the sentences which would have been imposed on Mr. Howard, apart from certain discounts. 
     
      
    244 Mr Howard pleaded guilty to two offences under the Corporations Act 2001. The two offences were:- 
     
      
       
      1. That contrary to s 184(2)(b) of the  
      Corporations Act 
       as an employee of HIH C&G he had used his position dishonestly, recklessly as to whether such use resulted in the present prisoner gaining an advantage, in that he dishonestly received from the prisoner cash sums totalling $124,000 in return for facilitating payments by HIH to the prisoner or companies associated with him. 
       
       
      2. That contrary to s 184(2)(a) of the  
      Corporations Act 
       as an employee of HIH C&G he had used his position dishonestly, with the intention of gaining an advantage for the prisoner, by facilitating the payment of $737,500 by HIH to the Goodwill Group Pty Limited, knowing that the payment obligation had already been discharged. 
       
      
    245 There is a degree of correspondence between the first offence for which Mr Howard was sentenced and the second to sixth offences for which I am sentencing the prisoner. The amount of $124,000 is the total or the approximate total of the five cash benefits given by the prisoner to Mr Howard between about 22 December 2000 and early March 2001. 
     
      
    246 Likewise, there is a degree of correspondence between the second offence for which Mr Howard was sentenced and the offences in counts seven to ten for which I am sentencing the prisoner. The amount of $737,500 is the total of the payments of $412,500 and $325,000 made to the Goodwill Group Pty Limited in the further payment of the Vision Publishing sponsorship claim 
     
      
    247 In the proceedings for the sentencing of Mr Howard an agreed statement of facts was tendered and admitted. Neither Mr Howard nor anyone else gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. As Mr Howard had pleaded guilty to both charges, there had not been any trial. 
     
      
    248 Mr Howard was sentenced by Kirby J of this Court on 23 December 2003.  
     
      
       
      
    249 On the first count Kirby J sentenced Mr Howard to imprisonment for one year nine months to date from 23 December 2003, the date of sentencing. On the second count Kirby J sentenced Mr Howard to imprisonment for two years to date from 23 December 2004, that is to say Kirby J made the sentence on the second count partly cumulative on the sentence for the first count. Kirby J made an order suspending both sentences. 
     
      
    250 Kirby J arrived at the sentences he imposed in the following manner. His Honour considered that, before allowing certain discounts, an appropriate sentence for each offence would be imprisonment for three years.  
     
      
    251 Mr Howard had pleaded guilty and was entitled to a discount for his pleas of guilty. Mr Howard had disclosed information previously unknown to the authorities. He was thus entitled to a discount under the principle in R v Ellis on both charges but Kirby J considered that he was entitled to a higher discount on count 1 than on count 2. Mr Howard had provided assistance and had undertaken to provide future assistance, including giving evidence against the present prisoner. 
     
      
    252 On count 1, after allowing a combined discount of 40 per cent for the plea of guilty, the Ellis factor and the discount for past assistance, Kirby J arrived at a sentence of one year nine months. 
     
      
    253 On count 2, after allowing a combined discount of 331/3 per cent for the plea of guilty, the Ellis factor and the discount for past assistance, Kirby J arrived at a sentence of two years. 
     
      
    254 Kirby J considered that there should be a partial accumulation of the two sentences. Because of Mr Howard’s undertaking to provide future assistance, his Honour suspended the execution of both sentences. 
     
      
    255 The present prisoner did not plead guilty, is not entitled to any Ellis discount, has not provided any past assistance, and has not undertaken to provide any future assistance.  
     
      
    256 It was submitted by counsel for the prisoner that the starting point of three years adopted by Kirby J, before allowing discounts for these matters, would be appropriate for each of the offences charged in counts 2 to 6 of the indictment and each of the offences charged in counts 7 to 10 of the indictment. It was not contended that the sentences should be suspended.  
     
      
    257 In my opinion, while there should be some proportionality between the sentences which would have been imposed on Mr Howard, but for the discounts, and the sentences which I should impose on the prisoner, the sentences which should be imposed on the prisoner should be higher. There are a number of reasons why this should be so.  
     
      
    258 Mr Howard was charged with offences under the Corporations Act for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for five years. The offences under s 249B(2)(b) of the Crimes Act for which I am sentencing the prisoner carry a higher maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. 
     
      
    259 As between the prisoner and Mr Howard, I am satisfied that, compliant and culpable as Mr Howard was, the prisoner was the instigator of the offences and for that reason his criminality was greater. The prisoner offered Mr Howard a bribe; it was not a case of Mr Howard soliciting a bribe. The idea of making the second claim for payment of the Vision Publishing sponsorship originated with the prisoner. 
     
      
    260 The conduct with which Mr Howard was charged and particulars of which were set out in the agreed facts and which was accordingly the conduct for which Mr Howard was sentenced, was less serious than the conduct I have found the prisoner engaged in and for which I am sentencing him. 
     
      
    261 In the first count against him Mr Howard was charged with having dishonestly used his position, “recklessly” as to whether the abuse of his position resulted in the prisoner gaining an advantage and with having received cash sums in return for “facilitating” payments by HIH to companies associated with the prisoner.  
     
      
    262 The meaning of the expression “facilitating” was unclear and was not resolved in the agreed statement of facts. As Kirby J remarked in his remarks on sentence, “the criminality involved in easing and accelerating the passage of legitimate claims is markedly different from the criminality in overlooking blatant exaggeration or deficiencies in the claims put forward”. 
     
      
    263 Kirby J would appear to have been constrained by the agreed facts and the absence of other evidence to sentence Mr Howard for the first offence on the basis that it could not be said that Mr Howard had any actual awareness of any of the claims being exaggerated or deficient. Indeed, Kirby J said in his remarks on sentence that, apart from the payment of $737,500 to the Goodwill Group Pty Limited, which was the subject of the second count, “it should not be assumed that these sums (that is the sums paid to the prisoner’s companies) represented a benefit to Mr Cooper to which he was not entitled. He was certainly not entitled to the duplicate payment of $737,500 for Vision Publishing. The remaining claims, however, to a greater or lesser extent may have been legitimate”. 
     
      
    264 The only claims referred to in relation to the first count against Mr Howard were the first Vision Publishing claim, the discount rebate claim, the Data Advantage claim and the Publicard shares claim. I have found that the prisoner knew that the conditions on which the first Vision Publishing claim might become payable had not been satisfied, that the Data Advantage claim was groundless, that the Publicard shares claim was utterly groundless and that the discount rebate claim was greatly exaggerated. 
     
      
    265 I have also found that other claims made by the prisoner’s companies, which were not before Kirby J, were also groundless. 
     
      
    266 It is true that Mr Howard’s conduct constituted breaches of trust by him and that the prisoner was not himself directly guilty of breaches of trust. However, as I have explained earlier, the prisoner was complicit in the breaches of trust by Mr Howard, intentionally procuring those breaches of trust. 
     
      
    267 Although the Data Advantage claim and the Publicard shares claim were two of the claims referred to by Kirby J in connection with the first count against Mr Howard, there were no charges against Mr Howard corresponding to counts 11, 12 and 13 in the indictment against the prisoner. 
     
      
       
      Multiple Offences 
       
      
    268 I am sentencing the prisoner for multiple offences. I take into account the sentencing principle in Pearce v The Queen that I should fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrency as well as questions of totality. 
     
      
    269 I take into account that in all cases, including where punishment is imposed for multiple offences, the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of the offender’s conduct. It will be necessary to make some of the offences partly cumulative, in order that this principle of sentencing should be satisfied. On the other hand, when a judge is sentencing for as many as thirteen offences, it is unavoidable, unless extreme complication and artificiality is resorted to, that there should be some grouping of sentences and some making of sentences fully concurrent with each other. 
     
      
    270 Some of the sentences I impose will be fixed terms of imprisonment, because, if a parole period was set, the parole period would be completely subsumed in the fixed term or the non-parole period of another sentence. The fixed terms of imprisonment will be equivalent to what would have been the non-parole periods in sentences containing a non-parole period and a parole period.  
     
      
    271 Because all the offences were committed before 1 February 2003, it is necessary to comply with the previous, and not the current, section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    272 It will be convenient to make the sentences for the false statement offences the first sentences to be served.  
     
      
      Special Circumstances 
       
      
    273 I do not consider that, because I am sentencing the prisoner for offences which might be broadly described as “white collar” crimes, there should be a substantial gap between the head sentence or sentences and the non-parole periods. I must set sentences such that the time that the offender must spend in prison reflects the objective gravity of his offences and the need for general deterrence. However, I am prepared to find special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in that the prisoner was previously of good character and has not previously been imprisoned. I will give effect to the finding of special circumstances by making the total of the fixed terms and non-parole periods less than three-quarters of the total terms of the sentences.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act an order made by Barr J by which his Honour dismissed the applicant’s motion to set aside a subpoena. 
     
      
    2 The applicant is to stand trial on 3 July 2006, next Monday, on three counts: 
     
      
       
      (1) unlawfully administering a drug to LT with intent to procure a miscarriage; 
       
      (2) unlawfully causing a drug to be taken by LT with intent to procure a miscarriage; and 
       
      (3) the manslaughter of PP. 
       
      
    3 The drug referred to in the charges has been described as a “Prostaglandin” type drug. 
     
      
    4 Central to the allegations against the applicant is a claim made by LT that the applicant agreed to perform the termination of LT’s pregnancy, and then inserted a tablet into LT’s vagina and gave her some tablets to take orally. 
     
      
    5 The Crown contends that these tablets were of the Prostaglandin type of drugs, an effect of which is to soften the cervix and, potentially, to cause the woman to go into labour. The Crown contends that, after the administration of these drugs, LT was allowed to go home where, at about 4 am the following day, she gave birth to a live baby, PP, who died shortly afterwards at Westmead Hospital. 
     
      
    6 The applicant is a doctor, and is insured for professional negligence with Australasian Medical Insurance Limited. The subpoena which is challenged in these proceedings, was issued at the request of the Crown to Australasian Medical Insurance and seeks provision of the following documents:  
     
      
       
        
        “... all statements, affidavits, complaints, medical reports, correspondence and settlement agreements or orders concerning any medical treatment or consultations with Dr Suman Sood by [KF], including any documents concerning a miscarriage or live birth.” 
        
       
      
    7 I understand that the documents sought in the subpoena have been, following the orders made by Barr J, produced to the Court. However, inspection of the documents has not been allowed. Any “legal advices or any other documents that are properly subject to a claim of legal professional privilege” were explicitly excluded from the schedule to the subpoena. 
     
      
    8 By notice of motion dated 13 June 2006, the Australasian Medical Insurance Limited sought to have the subpoena set aside. The basis for that motion was that the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition and amounts to an abuse of process. At the hearing of the matter counsel appeared on behalf of Australasian Medical Insurance Limited and also appeared for the applicant. Counsel appears today for the applicant and has indicated that although Australasian Medical Insurance Limited does not join the application, it is sympathetic to it. Barr J heard the application on 14 June 2006 when it was dismissed. 
     
      
    9 The charges arise, as I have indicated, from the alleged provision of a purported termination service to LT by the applicant at a time when it is alleged that LT was between 21 and 24 weeks pregnant. As I have indicated, the allegation is that the drugs were administered to her. She was then sent home, after which she went into labour and ultimately presented at the hospital. 
     
      
    10 The Crown accepts that the applicant is entitled to bring the application, but further submits that Barr J made no error of principle apt to cause irregularity or injustice: see R v Hoy (unreported, CCA, 18 July 1994); R v Stig (unreported, CCA, 17 October 1996). For this reason, the Crown opposes the grant of leave. 
     
      
    11 Before Barr J the applicant submitted that the respondent could not demonstrate a legitimate forensic purpose in the subpoena. That submission is repeated in this Court. 
     
      
    12 The Crown submits that a legitimate purpose in the issue of the subpoena is found in the fact that in 1998 the applicant treated KF, who subsequently miscarried on the way to hospital the next day, and so the Crown understands the facts are almost the same as those relating to LT. 
     
      
    13 Before Barr J, the Crown Prosecutor relied on four legitimate forensic purposes. They were:  
     
      
       
      (i) to meet the anticipated defence that the applicant does not terminate or take any step towards the termination of pregnancies in women more than 20 weeks pregnant; 
       
       
      (ii) to anticipate the applicant’s denial that she administers Prostaglandin and allows patients to go home unsupervised; 
       
       
      (iii) in anticipation that the applicant may bring evidence of good character concerning the manner in which she conducts her medical practice and to seek evidence of bad character concerning the manner in which she conducts her medical practice; 
       
       
      (iv) the production of the documents was likely to provide evidence of admission by conduct by the applicant that she was negligent on a previous occasion, and that, therefore, she was likely to have been relevantly negligent on the instant occasion. 
       
      
    14 No complaint is made that Barr J either misunderstood the relevant law or failed to apply it. His Honour identified the need to determine whether it was “on the cards” that the material produced will assist the prosecution case. His Honour found that the relevant test was satisfied on at least two bases; firstly, character evidence and, secondly, the allegation of criminal negligence. 
     
      
    15 Before this Court the applicant submitted that the subpoenaed material is unlikely to provide evidence of the applicant’s “bad character” or support an allegation of criminal negligence. The former challenge is based upon the proposition that so little is known of the circumstances of the prior event that it could not be said that evidence of “bad character” is on the cards. The essence of the second challenge is that it is unlikely that even if relevant material is found, it would be admissible in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    16 To my mind, the applicant has not demonstrated any error by Barr J which would entitle the applicant to a grant of leave. Although it is correct that the full facts of the previous events are not known, the essence of the allegations are such that the subpoena can, in my view, be justified. Whether the material revealed from the Australasian Medical Insurance file will justify its admission at the trial, as going to the applicant’s character, assuming that is in issue, will depend upon the documents which are produced. However, from the material presently available, his Honour was correct, in my view, to conclude that it was on the cards that the file would contain material of assistance to the Crown case. 
     
      
    17 I am also satisfied that the file may contain material which demonstrates from the history of the prior events that the applicant knew of the risks involved in administering Prostaglandin drugs, and the precautions which should be taken in relation to the health of the patient. Whether the material will be admissible at the trial is not a matter for this Court. 
     
      
    18 The applicant says it is highly unlikely to provide tendency or coincidence evidence, or contain admissions of negligence. I am not persuaded that this is so. The insurance file of an event similar to the circumstances of the current charge may well contain relevant admissions, having regard to the obligations arising from the relationship of the applicant with her insurer. 
     
      
    19 For these reasons, in my opinion, the application for leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
    20 There remains the question of orders, but I will come back to that later. 
     
      
    21 ADAMS J: I agree with the learned presiding judge, and I wish to add some remarks of my own. The conventional starting point for discussion of the principles governing subpoenas for the production of documents is the judgment of the Chief Justice in Alister v R [1983-1984] 154 CLR 404. It is from that judgment that Australian jurisprudence has come to use in this area the phrase, “on the cards”.  
     
      
    22 This is an area of law which has been bedevilled by metaphor – mixed at that, when one adds “fishing expedition” and the concomitants that phrase has spawned. It seems to me that the relevant test, in plain language, is whether there is a reasonable chance that some relevant material might be disclosed that is relevant to a potential issue in the trial. Of course, the issue and the forensic purpose for which the material is sought must be clearly identified. 
     
      
    23 As gauche as it is to refer to one’s own judgments, I discussed these matters in Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Connolly (2003) 57 NSWLR 310 at 10. I mention it here only to save me the trouble of repeating what I then said. 
     
      
    24 In this case the Crown has identified a legitimate forensic purpose, indeed a number of them. It is, of course, impossible, without inspection of the documents, to see whether they might serve any one or more of those purposes. Nevertheless, the documents specified in the subpoena seem to me to fall into a class of documents which might reasonably be thought to have material relevant to those identified forensic purposes. 
     
      
    25 Subject to issues of privacy, confidentiality, and oppression and privilege, it seems to me that the Crown should be entitled to the production and access to those documents. It is not suggested that either oppression or privilege apply or might apply in this case. Nevertheless, it is obvious from the mere description of the documents that questions of privacy or confidentiality do arise. 
     
      
    26 It was most unfortunate that the person who was the subject of the material sought to be subpoenaed, whose privacy was thus to be invaded, was not informed of the subpoena and given a timely opportunity to object, either to the production of the documents or to access being given to particular persons or to have a say in the potential use to which such documents might be put. This is, as I see it, a fundamental right. A person affected or potentially adversely affected by an order of a court should have the opportunity to be heard in relation to that order and unless the circumstances are exceptional. The circumstances here are not exceptional. 
     
      
    27 Having regard to the access limitations which this Court has in mind, as a practical matter this issue is not such as should prevent production of the documents, and the limited access which is proposed. Matters of the kind with which the document to be produced are concerned are obviously sensitive and the interest of the person involved should not have been overlooked. 
     
      
    28 Where an issue of privacy or confidentiality is present, there are a number of procedures available for the Court to deal with it. The usual way of doing so, where an objection is taken by the person whose privacy is affected to either production or access of the documents, is for the Court to inspect the documents to ascertain, firstly, whether or not the privacy or the confidentiality of the claim is legitimate and, secondly, whether in light of those legitimate claims some conditions should apply to disclosure or use of the material. For reasons that will be apparent from the transcript, it has not been necessary, in this case, for the Court to inspect the documents. 
     
      
    29 In a case involving, for example, State security or an informant’s identity, access to the material might be refused altogether. However, those are grounds already accepted as justifying, in some cases, extreme orders of that kind. In the normal course, mere personal embarrassment could not stand in the way of the production of documents reasonably necessary for the conduct at least of a criminal trial, where public policy requires the disclosure of all relevant material. 
     
      
    30 Nevertheless, considerations of privacy and confidentiality may well lead to adjustments of access orders and limitations and qualifications on the use of the material. I do not know whether the person involved here is concerned about her privacy, or would be concerned to seek some qualification in the use of the material. What is clear is that she should have been, and must now be, given the opportunity to be heard at least before the documentary material is at least used. 
     
      
    31 It might be that when inspection occurs, further access than is presently envisaged occurs will be desirable, but that will be, in my mind, a matter properly for the trial judge to determine. 
     
      
    32 Subject to those remarks, I agree with the Chief Judge at Common law. 
     
      
    33 LATHAM J: I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law. 
     
      
    34 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: It follows that leave to appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Ming Jin, appeals against his conviction of two counts of dishonestly obtaining money by deception after a trial in the District Court. He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating three years, with a non-parole period of one year and nine months, to date from 3 October 2004. He notified an application for leave to appeal against sentence, but he abandoned it at the hearing. No doubt, this is because he is due for release on parole very soon, on 2 July 2006.  
     
      
    3 He was legally represented at the trial but he has prepared and argued his appeal without representation. His notice of appeal was lodged almost a year out of time, but the Crown raised no objection on that account. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    4 The course of the trial is conveniently summarised in the Crown prosecutor’s written submissions, as follows: 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
       
        
        Ms Yi Yin Choi was a married woman who was living in Australia with her two children. Her husband Mr Wong was a wealthy man who supported her but who was living in Hong Kong. Whilst Ms Choi was studying English at the Migrant Centre in Surry Hills she met the appellant and formed a relationship with him. The appellant told Ms Choi that he was a businessman from New York on an American passport. He said that he was in the medicine business and that he was investing $250,0000 in Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant told Ms Choi that he needed to borrow $150,000 from her for ingredients to produce medicine. He said he would repay her by 15 July 1999. Ms Choi said that she only had $80,000 and on 22 June 1999 she gave him $80,000 in cash. She did not obtain anything in writing from him about the loan because she trusted that he was able to pay the money back by 15 July 1999. The money was never repaid (count 1). 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant learnt that Ms Choi had $390,000 in a term deposit which was due to mature on 16 July 1999. On 15 July 1999 the appellant asked Ms Choi if he could borrow money so he could complete a contract with a medical manufacturing company in North Sydney. He said if he did not pay the money he would lose his $1.31 million deposit. The appellant promised her that if she gave him the $390,000, which he needed in cash, that he would give her two cheques, for the $80,000 and the $390,000, on the following Monday the 19th July 1999 when he returned from a short trip to China. 
        
       
       
        
        On 16 July 1999 Ms Choi withdrew the $390,000 and gave it to the appellant who told her that he was taking the money to the North Sydney manufacturer. Later that day Ms Choi saw the appellant at the Star City Casino when he confirmed that he had sent the money to the manufacturer and that he would repay her on the Monday. The appellant rang Ms Choi from overseas to say that he had been arrested at Beijing airport and his assets had been frozen. Ms Choi never heard from him again and never saw him again (count 2). 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Choi realised she had been cheated by the appellant, so she called her husband who advised her to report the matter to the police. Ms Choi contacted “Bobby” who was an English speaking friend of her husband’s. On 19 July 1999 Bobby spoke on Ms Choi’s behalf to a security guard at the Peak apartments. The security Guard took an “Incident Report” and handed it to police that day. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant had in fact left Sydney on 17 July 1999 on a ticket to Shanghai (not Beijing). He returned from China on 15 June 2003. He was arrested at the Casino on 17 June 2003 after he was seen there by Ms Choi’s friend. 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
       
        
        The appellant did not give or call evidence in the trial. Rather the appellant’s case was advanced through cross-examination of the Crown witnesses. In that regard, it was put to Ms Choi that the payments of $80,000 and $390,000, together with a further amount of $10,000, were paid to the appellant as the purchase price of a painting by Tang Yi, which the appellant sold to her. Ms Choi, Ms (Amy) Qin, and Ms (Sasha) Mei each gave evidence of an occasion on which the appellant had shown them two paintings which he said were valuable and which he was carrying in a briefcase. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Choi was cross-examined about: her statements to police; her admission to them that the appellant had shown her a painting about Tom Pat Fu; and the fact that the appellant had told her that the painting he had could be sold at a profit. 
        
       
       
        
        It was put to the jury on the appellant’s behalf that: they would have serious doubts about the evidence of Ms Choi; there was simply nothing in writing to confirm the alleged loans to the appellant; the unlikelihood that Ms Choi would give someone she had only known a few months such large amounts of cash unless it was for some other purpose such as to obtain the painting; the evidence of other witnesses supported the appellant’s possession of paintings; Ms Choi expected to marry the appellant, and the jury would accept that she could have the money and the painting; the only person who was deceived was Ms Choi’s husband; the inconsistent statement made to the security officer that the appellant had told her he had family problems linked to money, and not that he needed money for pharmaceuticals. 
        
       
       
        
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    5 The appellant filed five grounds of appeal. He also filed a written submission which deals with some of those grounds, and adds a significant amount of new material. He presented lengthy oral argument at the hearing. The Crown prosecutor furnished helpful and detailed written submissions in response to the appellant’s written material, and was content to rely upon those submissions at the hearing. In the event, I do not believe that I would do disservice to the arguments of either of them by dealing with the matter relatively briefly. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    6 The effect of the first ground of appeal is a complaint that the trial judge directed the jury that their verdicts must be unanimous, and did not explain that they could be discharged if they were unable to agree. The short answer to that ground is that no occasion for such an explanation arose at the trial. The jury might have been told of the possibility of discharge if they had conveyed to the judge that they were having difficulty agreeing upon verdicts and his Honour had given them a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44. However, they did not convey any such difficulty. Indeed, they returned with verdicts after a retirement of only one hour and twenty-two minutes. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    7 The second ground relates to a document which was in evidence as exhibit C. The document was written by the appellant and expressed his intention to marry Ms Choi. He signed it. She also signed it, firstly in a different name and then in her own name. She gave evidence of why she did so, the effect of which, as I understand it, is that she did not take the document seriously. She said that the document came into being before she provided any money to the appellant. 
     
      
    8 The ground of appeal complains that the jury sent a question to the trial judge, asking what was implied by the “fraudulent signatures on the promise to marry”, to which the judge responded that it did not matter. However, the transcript records no such exchange. It does record that during the summing-up the jury sent a note to his Honour requesting “a translation” of the document “in relation to the two signatures”. This led his Honour to remind them of Ms Choi’s evidence about the document. That, of course, was entirely appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    9 The summary of the evidence set out above refers to the “incident report” prepared by the security guard to whom Ms Choi spoke on 19 July 1999. That document also was in evidence, as exhibit A. On the face of it, two matters contained in it were inconsistent with Ms Choi’s evidence at the trial, and she was cross-examined about that. As to one of them, she denied having said what was recorded in the document. She had spoken to the security officer through an (unqualified) interpreter. 
     
      
    10 The third ground claims that, in relation to “a huge discrepancy” between the incident report and Ms Choi’s evidence, the judge had said that “it might be a mistake made by the interpreter…”. It is not necessary to recite the detail of the inconsistencies about which Ms Choi was cross-examined. It is sufficient to say that they could not readily be described as “a huge discrepancy”. More importantly, the appellant does not identify any part of the transcript in which his Honour said the words attributed to him about a mistake made by the interpreter. When dealing generally with the incident report in the summing-up, he invited the jury to bear in mind that it had been obtained through an interpreter. There the matter appears to have rested and, again, this was entirely appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    11 The fourth ground relates to the appellant’s understanding of the trial proceedings. It complains that the interpreter at the trial spoke Cantonese while he spoke Mandarin, and that the judge refused a request by his counsel to change the interpreter. Again, the transcript does not record any such exchange between counsel and the trial judge. Morevover, it is contradicted by the affidavit of the appellant’s solicitor at the trial, who is also Chinese and, I take it, fluent in Mandarin. It appears that, in fact, there were two interpreters during the course of the trial and the solicitor had no difficulty understanding either of them.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    12 The fifth ground alleges a lack of capacity and competence on the part of counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. It is sufficient to say that that complaint is answered effectively by an affidavit of counsel, and there is nothing in the record of the trial to suggest other than that the appellant’s case was conducted diligently and ably. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    13 In his written submission, the appellant also made an allegation against his solicitor about a matter unconnected with the conduct of the trial. He produced no evidence to support the allegation, and it is denied in the solicitor’s affidavit. As it does not bear upon the conduct of the trial, it is of no present relevance.  
     
      
    14 The appellant also complains in the written submission that his solicitor and counsel did not allow him “to speak and defend himself during the hearing”. This, no doubt, is a reference to the fact that he did not give evidence. However, the transcript records a statement by counsel after an adjournment that the appellant had provided instructions that he did not wish to give evidence. Moreover, annexed to the affidavits of both the solicitor and the barrister are copies of written instructions to that effect signed by the appellant and attested to by an interpreter.  
     
      
    15 The written submission complains of other things alleged to have been said by his Honour during the summing-up. Yet again, the statements complained of do not appear in the transcript. It is also said that two questions asked by the jury were not answered, but from the transcript it appears that any question that was asked was answered. Finally, complaint is directed to an observation which his Honour made in the course of referring to evidence relating to the painting. His Honour did make the observation but it was within his province to do so and, in any event, he made it clear that it was a matter for the jury to assess. 
     
      
    16 Otherwise, the written submission and the appellant’s oral argument amounted to a criticism of the evidence in the trial, and the assertion that certain material not produced at the trial was inconsistent with Ms Choi’s evidence or supported his account of relevant events. Argument was directed, in particular, to the evidence about the painting, about his departure from Sydney in July 1999 and the phone call said to be from Beijing, and about his relationship with Ms Choi. He sought to impugn her credibility generally. 
     
      
    17 In so far as he relied upon material not led at the trial, or issues not raised at the trial, he has provided no basis for this Court to receive and consider that material as fresh evidence. Some of them are matters about which he might have given evidence if he had chosen to do so, although it must be said that in large part they were of peripheral relevance only. Otherwise, his criticisms of the evidence were the subject of cross-examination and were dealt with by counsel in their addresses, and were for the jury to assess. It is sufficient to say that nothing he raised could provide any justification for the verdict being set aside. 
     
      
    18 I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    19 KIRBY J: I agree with Hidden J.

      2005/1145 - REGINA v MARGARET JALATY 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Margaret Jalaty, you have been found guilty by a jury of the crimes of murder and maliciously administering a noxious thing so as to endanger life. The victim of both crimes was your daughter who is named in the indictment as Alia Maarbani but who was also frequently called Talia.  
     
      
    2 You are not willing to acknowledge your guilt and have continued to maintain that Talia accessed and ingested the methadone herself or, on the fatal occasion, it may have been given to her by a man named Jason Riggs. Those propositions were advanced at trial and were obviously rejected by the jury who were equally obviously satisfied that your guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt on both counts. It is necessary for me to make findings to the same standard, not inconsistent with your guilt for the purpose of sentence. 
     
      
    3 In chronological order, your first crime was administering methadone so as to endanger the child’s life. In 1998 you had been involved in a motor car accident in which a vehicle was struck from behind and you suffered injury with consequent symptoms of a high level of back pain. For relief of this pain you were medically treated with pethidine and later with morphine. You became addicted to these narcotics. I accept that your encounter with these drugs emerged out of what might seem to be unusual treatment for the symptoms of which you complained but that it was not a result of your seeking drugs for recreational or illicit purposes. It was in recognition of your addiction that you were eventually placed on a methadone programme. 
     
      
    4 Methadone was made available to you through a pharmacy at which you were registered. You obtained it in two ways. Either you ingested a dose at the pharmacy in an area which was set aside for such purpose or you were given “takeaway” doses in sealed bottles. As a result of the latter procedure you had methadone in your home. I am satisfied that you did not follow the prescribed routine of ingestion and this resulted in your having accumulated quantities of drugs stored in your home. 
     
      
    5 Talia was born on 21 October 1999 and as at August 2003 she was aged about three years and ten months. 
     
      
    6 There were concerns about her development and behaviour and a drug known as catapres or clonodine was prescribed by a doctor at Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick. Later you took her to see Dr McCahon, a paediatrician at the Children’s Hospital, Westmead, where she had been admitted for tests which established that Talia was taking clonodine. I find that, after the tests at Westmead on 29 June 2003 Talia was in accordance with Dr McCahon’s medical advice taken off the clonodine. I expressly reject your contradictory evidence that you were obtaining a supply from a doctor in Bankstown. 
     
      
    7 It is not necessary for me to detail the disputes which you claim you had with staff at Westmead Hospital and specifically with Dr McCahon, but I should record that I accept Dr McCahon as a witness of truth, who was obviously very concerned about the welfare of your child. 
     
      
    8 You and Talia kept an appointment with Dr McCahon on 22 August 2003 and I accept her evidence that Talia was neurologically improved when examined on this occasion and that Dr McCahon correctly diagnosed this improvement as resulting from her having ceased taking clonodine. 
     
      
    9 Two days later on 25 August Talia was presented at Bankstown Hospital in cardiac respiratory arrest. She was transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital and successfully treated. A urine sample taken that day was later analysed and proved positive to methadone and its metabolite. 
     
      
    10 You had given the child methadone as you ultimately confessed to police. I do not accept your suggestions that Talia obtained methadone by drinking the residue of a discarded bottle which you had not fully taken yourself. This action of yours gave rise to the count for maliciously administering a noxious thing so as to endanger life. 
     
      
    11 It is convenient to record at this point that I reject your assertions that the interview with Detectives Stamoulis and Karras which commenced at 11.59 am on 15 December 2004 reflected false admissions which you made because of threats by them or some sort of “deal” concerning sentence.  
     
      
    12 After it was established that Talia’s condition in August was caused by methadone intoxication or poisoning, Dr Williams at the Randwick Hospital told you that ingestion of methadone by a child like Talia was life threatening. On your own evidence at trial you agreed that you listened very carefully to him when he told you how dangerous methadone was for a child and you added in your testimony that, before Dr Williams told you these things, you knew that even a small amount of methadone would be dangerous and you expressly said “If it was to be given to a child, yes they would die”.  
     
      
    13 Although possessed of this knowledge, on 23 November 2003, by which time Talia was aged about four years and two months, you again administered methadone to her.  
     
      
    14 Overnight on this occasion the man, Jason Riggs, was a guest at your flat. A considerable time at trial was occupied in detailing the events surrounding your relationship with him and the events of that night. I will not pause to recite this detail, save to note that the evidence of your emergence wearing the night attire described offered a fairly plain indication of your desires and intentions. It was incumbent on the Crown to negative the possibility that this man may have administered the drug to the child, as indeed the Crown was required to negative the possibility that she ingested it herself.  
     
      
    15 Necessarily the jury found and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was you who gave Talia this methadone also, as you eventually admitted to police. Although I do not accept all of the embroidered assertions which accompany the inculpating admissions that you ultimately made, I accept that you wanted Talia to cease to be a potential source of interruption to your interaction with your guest and, in that sense, you wanted to put her to sleep, as you said at one point in the police interview. However, as you testified, you appreciated the probable fatal consequence of giving methadone to a child of her age but you determined so to do, and did so, regardless of the likelihood of death.  
     
      
    16 As my findings imply, I reject the arguments advanced that it was possible that Jason Riggs had anything to do with the administration of methadone to the child and I also reject the suggestions that he had entered the child’s room for some criminal or improper purpose or that he had in fact entered the child’s room in the flat. The circumstance that crime scene police obtained a presumptive response to testing a stain on the floor which was positive for semen among other possible substances does not establish anything inculpatory of Mr Riggs. 
     
      
    17 Shortly stated, the critical facts are that in August 2003 you gave methadone to Talia which endangered her life. In November 2003 you again gave her methadone knowing at that time of the likelihood that it would be fatal as, tragically, it was. 
     
      
    18 I turn to deal with other matters including subjective considerations.  
     
      
    19 You were born on 17 September 1972, the youngest of nine children. I accept that the family circumstances were strict and you were generally unhappy. I have read the personal history which you gave to Ms Carney and to Dr Tran and Miss Stapleton of the Probation and Parole Service. It is plain that your life has passed through much tumult. I have no doubt that, as described, your being despatched to Lebanon for the purpose of marriage, culminating in two imposed and virtually sham marriages were painful ordeals leaving understandable scars in your thought processes. 
     
      
    20 After return to Australia you were injured in the motor vehicle accident which led to the narcotic dependency abovementioned. 
     
      
    21 You met Talia’s father Michael and by reason of differences in his and your family’s religion, your family for the most part, isolated you and you were to a significant extent shunned. Your partner did not want the child but you rejected his proposal to terminate the pregnancy. For many years you had been told that successful childbearing was medically unlikely and in due course Talia was born and it was frequently stated that you regarded her as your “miracle baby”.  
     
      
    22 I am conscious that even after conviction you continued to proclaim your love of Talia but this is contradicted by your treatment of her. Despite the paradoxes implicit in your proclamations on the one hand, and your proven conduct in August and November 2003 on the other, I proceed to sentence on the basis of your proven guilt of the crimes charged. 
     
      
    23 I have concluded that in August 2003 you probably gave the methadone to Talia, knowing it was dangerous but intending, perhaps experimentally, to see if it would affect her levels of hyperactivity and/or insomnia. I am satisfied that you were conscious of your wrongdoing and this was subsequently evidenced by your failure to give an honest history to Dr Williams and further, after the detection of the methadone by the urine screen, your false statement to him that you could not provide any explanation as to how it came to be in Talia’s body. It is since that attempt at deception that you have advanced the theory that Talia must have retrieved a bottle from a disposal bin which you had not fully emptied. I have already indicated that I reject that suggestion. 
     
      
    24 In November 2003 and beforehand I believe you had become extremely lonely to the point where you had made contact with Jason Riggs through Lava Life, which I understand to be some kind of introduction agency. After being put in touch with each other, you had extremely long telephone conversations and, after some false starts you actually met on the particular evening and this was probably perceived by you as a chance to remedy your feelings of isolation. It is probable, I consider, that your fatal administration of methadone was done to prevent Talia spoiling that perceived chance. 
     
      
    25 I reiterate that these just mentioned conclusions are not matters of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt but I record them in your interests as against the alternative that, absent any explanation, it would be necessary to proceed to sentence simply on the basis that on successive occasions you first gave an innocent child a nearly lethal dose of methadone and thereafter on a second administration, a lethal dose of it, the potential of which probably to kill you were well aware.  
     
      
    26 Even on the basis of the more favourable alternative you bear a considerable weight of culpability. I do not approach sentence on the rather hyperbolic approach suggested by Ms Carney at the end of her report that “the length of time that she spends in prison will be negligible in comparison with the pain and sense of hopelessness she experiences or will experience when she becomes fully cognizant about the loss of her precious daughter” but I do so on the basis that your behaviour should be judged in the light of acute loneliness from which you were suffering. “Loneliness” is an inadequate word and I comprehend within it all the background miseries which had affected your life beforehand. 
     
      
    27 Ms Carney’s observation just quoted would seem to ignore entirely the circumstance that your actions killed the child. Whilst I have examined the psychological and psychiatric reports which have been tendered, they are of diminished utility because each expert had to form opinions in the circumstance that you denied any culpability indeed you continue to deny that you ever gave methadone to Talia. 
     
      
    28 Although Ms Carney’s report, as well as the reports of Dr Tran and Ms Stapleton are before the Court by consent, it is necessary to examine some of the statements therein with caution. For example, Ms Carney asserts that you told her that your guilt feelings relate to your inability to protect your daughter from danger but this is in effect simply a repetition of your unwillingness to admit guilt and is somewhat inconsistent with Ms Carney’s own description of scoring the clinical personality dimensions which, under the title of guilt and resentment, she recorded “this aspect of depression is associated with the belief of having committed an unpardonable act and experiencing the utter worthlessness that follows”.  
     
      
    29 A belief of having committed an unpardonable act does not conform with an assertion that guilt is being felt for being unable to protect the child.  
     
      
    30 You have some prior convictions, the pattern of which shows that it was associated with the narcotic addiction, for which addiction I have said you should not be regarded as blameworthy. I do not consider that your prior convictions should have any effect adverse to you in sentence assessment and in particular it should not deprive you of any lenience which might otherwise be afforded to you. 
     
      
    31 You still complain of chronic back pain and to the extent that you so suffer, your custody will be the more onerous than it would be if you were in good health. I take that circumstance into account in your favour. 
     
      
    32 I have indicated my conclusions as to probable motivation and whether I am correct about them or not, there is no reason to consider that you represent a danger to anyone in the future and in that sense I hold that your prospects for rehabilitation are favourable.  
     
      
    33 In the absence of any acknowledgment of guilt I cannot, however, find that you are contrite or in any real sense remorseful. 
     
      
    34 I should deal with some specific submissions by your counsel. I reject the proposition that because Talia was refusing to settle down or sleep on the November night that this amounted to provocative conduct on her part.  
     
      
    35 I note that you have been in protective custody and that the nature of your offences involving a child victim makes it likely that this will extend over a long period and possibly for the whole of your time in custody. I accept your evidence about the restriction of activity, as I accept your explanation of the apparent contradiction in the documents concerning this matter which I raised during the sentence hearing. Custody in protection is likely to be less advantageous than custody in the general prison population and that is again a matter which I take into account as an ameliorating factor in assessment.  
     
      
    36 It is convenient to record at this point your verification of the history in particular that which you gave to Ms Carney, and the acknowledgment by the Crown that there would be no challenge arising from the circumstance that detail given to her does not appear in the pre sentence report by Ms Stapleton and the report of Dr Tran. I act upon the background history as recorded by Ms Carney. 
     
      
    37 I have made some earlier reference to matters of history but the fact that I have not recited everything that appears in Ms Carney’s report does not indicate that I do not take into account matters of suffering and constant misfortune which she had recorded which include isolation, rejection, molestation by an adult, rape by schoolboys when you were a schoolgirl and the disastrous marriages in Lebanon, which were apparently arranged by members of your family, who had conceived an idea that the consequences of the rape would diminish your prospects of marriage otherwise. 
     
      
    38 These remarks are principally directed to you in explanation of matters which I have taken into account in sentence assessment. I have tried to avoid what might be seen to be some sort of lecture on matters of law but it is necessary to deal with one such issue by reason of a direct statutory applicability. This relates to the sentence to be imposed for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    39 I should explain to you that an Act of Parliament requires me to first set a non parole period, that is the minimum period in which you must be kept in detention. The Act of Parliament also provides that I am to set what is called the standard non parole period unless I determine otherwise and if I do, I am to record my reasons for so doing, identifying each factor that I have taken into account.  
     
      
    40 The applicable prescribed standard non parole period for murder is imprisonment for twenty years. This is said to represent the non parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. There is in fact a higher prescribed period for murders involving victims who were when slain exercising particular offices, but it is of no relevance to your circumstances. 
     
      
    41 I have concluded that I should depart from the standard non parole period in your favour. I do not understand the statutory obligation cast on me to identify each factor as requiring the incantation of a litany of such factors and separately weighting them and I can comply with the necessity for identification by a statement of reasons. Sentence assessment, you should understand is fundamentally to be derived from an intuitive synthesis of multiple factors, some of which tend towards lengthening of sentence and others towards reduction. 
     
      
    42 A submission by your counsel initially contending that in any case murder as a result of reckless indifference to human life is lower in the scale of seriousness than murder by intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm was modified to contend that, in this particular case, a lower proportion of blameworthiness should be found. The issue is important and as I have said I need to assess whether, other considerations apart, the murder committed by you lies in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offence. 
     
      
    43 In a written outline of submissions the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor has fairly stated that “often in this kind of case the offender would be convicted of manslaughter”. In general terms, the statement implies a recognition of the practical difficulty of proving that an alleged offender knew of the probability of death of the victim, as distinct from knowing of danger or likely serious injury which is insufficient to prove murder but would sustain manslaughter. In this case, the Crown had evidence of what you had been told by Dr Williams in August and information that you would have accessed during your own treatment with methadone from the pharmacy and elsewhere. Even so, a verdict of manslaughter would not have been, if that had been the extent of the evidence, surprising. However, you unequivocally testified as your relevant knowledge of the likelihood of death if methadone were given to a child and the real central issue for determination at trial was whether it had simply been proved that you were the one who had given the child the drug. As the Crown Prosecutor continued in his outline, if the jury were satisfied that you were the one who gave the methadone, a verdict of guilty of murder was almost inevitable, but he added “in such a situation it might be argued that to apply the standard non parole period would be too harsh”. 
     
      
    44 The objective facts on the count of murder are that you gave this lethal substance to a child knowing that her death would probably result. I would assess that to lie within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offence. In so saying I bear in mind that culpability for murder can range from killing in the heat of a moment’s passion which could lie towards the lower extreme and cold blooded contract killing which could lie towards an upper extreme. As a matter of objective assessment your crime lies at neither extreme and I have categorized it as stated. 
     
      
    45 Nevertheless, before applying the standard non parole period it is open to take other matters, including subjective matters, into account. I have adverted to your probable motive and, without seeking to over dramatise the situation, I consider that your actions were provoked by a desperate attempt to seize an opportunity of forming some relationship with the man whom you had contacted through the introduction agency. Given the history of your isolation, disastrous arranged marriages, abandonment by Talia’s father, shunning by most of your family, abuse which you had suffered in the past, continued suffering of accident induced pain, addiction arising from prescription of narcotics, and perceptions of a likely lonely future, I consider you had become vulnerable to succumbing to performing what Ms Carney accurately described as “an unpardonable act”. 
     
      
    46 The matters which I have mentioned would combine in what I would call elements of motive and mental state and that combination leads me to conclude that this is not an appropriate case to implement the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    47 I do not overlook the independent seriousness of the offence of administering the methadone so as to endanger life which was committed some months before the murder. The Crown Prosecutor did not submit that cumulation was necessary but in the event that the sentences were to be served concurrently, he correctly contended that the totality principle would require reflection in the encompassing term of sentence. 
     
      
    48 After setting first the non parole period the Act of Parliament that I have mentioned specifies that the balance of term is not to exceed one third of the non parole period unless there are special circumstances for so doing. Although there are matters which are capable of being so categorized, I have come to the conclusion that in this case it is appropriate to adhere to the statutory formula. I am not obliged to give reasons for adhering to it, but I state that in my assessment the interests applicable to you will be appropriately met by the sentences which I now impose. 
     
      
    49 While in your particular circumstances it has been necessary to elaborate to an extent on matters that can be taken into account in mitigation and to observe your continuing denial of responsibility, you must be punished for your actions which first endangered and then killed a defenceless child who was entitled to look to you as her primary source of protection. Children are among the most vulnerable members of society and the life of every one of them is precious and the community would rightly expect that someone such as you, who has criminally taken such a life, receive just and necessarily significant punishment. Your own actions condemn you and the sentence which I impose must be adequate to denounce your actions as well as fulfilling other applicable principles of sentence assessment. 
     
      
    50 Margaret Jalaty, for the murder of Alia Maarbani, you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of fifteen years to commence on 15 December 2004 and expire on 14 December 2019, with a balance term of five years commencing on 15 December 2019. 
     
      
    51 For maliciously administering a noxious thing to Alia Maarbani, so as to endanger her life, you are sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 15 December 2004 and expiring on 14 December 2009. 
     
      
    52 Those sentences will be served concurrently. 
     
      
    53 I set no non parole period in respect of the latter sentence as it will be fully subsumed within the non parole period of the former sentence. 
     
      
    54 The earliest date of eligibility for consideration of release to parole is specified as 14 December 2019.
