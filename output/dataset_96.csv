Cur Adv Vult
 
This is a petition for criminal revision in which the petitioner seeks to have set aside her conviction of 22 May 1992 on the following charge, on the basis that her plea of guilt to this charge ought not to have been accepted by the district court: 
 
You, Yenna Ong Ah Yeo, are charged that you between 20 and 22 June 1990, in Singapore, abetted one Lim Teck Cheng, a director of Wyno Marine Pte Ltd (`Wyno`) who in such capacity being entrusted with dominion over property, namely, moneys belonging to Wyno, to commit criminal breach of trust as an agent, in that you intentionally aided the said Lim Teck Cheng to dishonestly misappropriate the sum of $282,000 when you arranged for Wyno to pay to one Lee & Kong Engineering Works the said sum pursuant to two invoices Nos 1267/90 and 1268/90 both dated 20 June 1990 and have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
On her plea of guilt and subsequent conviction, she was sentenced to six months` imprisonment. The main grounds she relies upon in asking for revision of those proceedings are as follows. First, the principal accused, Lim Teck Cheng, has claimed trial to the charge against him of committing the offence of criminal breach of trust which the petitioner has been convicted of abetting. Secondly, she has been advised that the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution in support of the charge set out above did not in fact support that charge.
Counsel`s first main submission was that where a principal accused has not been found guilty of an offence, no person may be convicted of intentionally aiding such an offence. Section 108 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides that: 
 
A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
 
 
 
Explanation 2 of this section is as follows: 
 
To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.
 
 
 
Explanation 2 may not immediately appear to be within the plain meaning of s 108, but illustration (a) of this explanation is: 
 
A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.
 
 
 
The express words of explanation 2 and illustration (a) are sufficient to show that, for an abettor to be convicted, the principal accused need not always be proved to have committed the offence (or the actus reus of the offence) for which he is charged.
Counsel contended that nevertheless, where the alleged abetment takes the specific form of intentional aid, rather than instigation or conspiracy, the principal must be found guilty of the offence aided before the abettor may be convicted, because `a person cannot aid another in doing something which that other has not done` (per Avory J in 
 Morris v Tolman 
 1).
In 
 Faguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam 
 ,2 the court said at p 674: 
 
In the case of abetment by aid a person can be said to abet by aiding only when by the commission of an act he intends to facilitate the commission of the offence and does facilitate the commission thereof. Therefore where a person is charged with abetment by aid of an offence under s 161 and the person charged with the offence is acquitted on the ground that he had not committed the offence no question of intentionally aiding by any act or omission the commission of that offence arises. Therefore whether the acquittal is right or wrong the conviction of the abettor also cannot be allowed to stand in the circumstances.
 
 
 
In 
 Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar 
 ,3 the court said: 
 
It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that the act abetted must be committed. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.
 
 
 
I have considered these and other authorities cited to me and I am persuaded that they are consistent with counsel`s proposition. In the normal case the charge against an abettor should state the act he is alleged to have abetted. This is as true of charges of abetment by intentional aid as it is of charges of abetment by instigation or conspiracy. This act therefore forms part of the prosecution`s case against the alleged abettor. There is in the meaning of `instigation` and `conspiracy` no inherent assumption that either the instigation or the conspiracy came to fruition, and so while the act instigated or conspired towards by the abettor can and must be identified, the fact that its actual commission might not be proved is unobjectionable. Conversely, the word `aid` does imply that the act aided was committed, so it follows that the prosecution must prove the commission of the act which an abettor is alleged to have aided intentionally.
Indeed the prosecution must prove more than this. Intentionally aiding the commission of an act is not the same as intentionally aiding the commission of an offence. Explanation 2 of s 107 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
 
 
 
This, read with s 108, indicates that a person may abet an offence who aids in the commission of an act which might only be a constituent part of the whole actus reus of the offence. If he may only be said to have aided where the aid has given results, then it follows that he may only be said to have intentionally aided that offence if the whole actus reus of the offence itself is proved to have been committed. If it has not and only the act which forms a part of the actus reus of the offence has been proved to have been committed, his intentional aiding of that act may only support his liability for intentionally aiding an attempted commission of the offence (assuming the evidence amounts to such attempt).
However, I would depart from many of the Indian cases in the following respect. The fact that the act intentionally aided must have been committed does not mean that the principal should of necessity have been convicted prior to the alleged abettor in order that the latter may be found liable for aiding him. The sequence in which the principal and the intentional aider are tried is frequently a matter of chance; and indeed, on occasion it may not be possible to try the principal at any time at all, for example, where he dies before trial or where he cannot be found. It is quite unacceptable that in these cases the intentional aider should also be immune from liability.
Moreover the conviction of the abettor turns on the evidence against him, which may be different from that admitted against the principal. I turn gratefully to the judgment of West J in 
 R v Maruti Dada 
 4 for the full expression of this conception: 
 
The offence of abetment under the Penal Code is a substantive offence ... By the Indian as well as the English procedure, an abettor may be convicted before the principal is arrested. The principal may then be tried and acquitted, but in this case the abettor has not suffered any wrong. A rational doubt may exist as to the identity or guilt of the principal through the legal exclusion as to him of particular portions of the evidence, and yet there may be no possible doubt as to the guilt of the abettor, in whose case the rules of exclusion do not happen to operate. It would be a perversion of the rules of evidence if because the operation of a rule is to exclude evidence against a principal, A, it should operate to the acquittal of an abettor, B, who may have fully confessed ... and may, without doubt, be guilty. The mere circumstance that B is tried along with A, instead of at a different trial, cannot alter the real force of the case against him.
 
 
 
Again, in 
 R v Humphreys and Turner 
 5 there is an instructive passage in the judgment of Chapman J: 
 
It may seem anomalous ... that even if a principal offender is acquitted, a conviction of aiding and abetting him may still be valid, but the logic of the situation is wrapped up in the rules of evidence. In a case where two people are charged a jury is always directed to consider each case separately. This is because the evidence as against one accused or another may be quite different in validity (ie admissibility) or strength. ... It would be anomalous if a person who admitted to a substantial part in the perpetration of a misdemeanour as aider and abettor could not be convicted on his own admission merely because the person alleged to have been aided and abetted was not or could not be convicted.
 
 
 
In my view, the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentionally aiding an offence must direct its mind towards making a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed; and the court may, indeed must, do so in all cases, including those where the principal has not been convicted of that offence by the time the alleged intentional aider is tried.
In short, although illustration (a) of explanation 2 of s 108 indicates that an abettor`s liability may extend beyond situations in which the principal is entitled to be acquitted on the basis of a defence personal to himself to situations where the actus reus of the offence has not been committed, this extension cannot apply where the abetment takes the form of intentional aid rather than instigation or conspiracy.
No doubt the danger of inconsistent verdicts becomes live as a result of this interpretation since, for example, the court which tries the principal may acquit him whereas the intentional aider might have been convicted earlier, implying possibly incompatible findings made by two courts as to the principal`s liability. In the first place, the potential discrepancy between such findings does not mean this procedure is logically flawed, as explained in the passages quoted from 
 R v Maruti Dada 
 4 and 
 R v Humphreys and Turner 
 .5 Further, many other factors and interests are operative. In my view, it would be unworkable and prejudicial to the public interest to insist unwaveringly upon the ideal that the principal and the intentional aider should always be tried in some particular order even though, where they are not tried in that order, the spectre of inconsistent verdicts will be unavoidable.
Applying these principles to the present case, the court before which the petitioner pleaded guilty had to have been satisfied on the material before it, namely, the prosecution`s statement of facts tendered in support of the charge against the petitioner, that Lim Teck Cheng had committed the actus reus of the offence the petitioner was alleged to have abetted. The fact that Lim Teck Cheng had chosen to claim trial should not have affected that finding. Therefore all that was required of the prosecution was that the statement of facts should disclose, inter alia, the actus reus of the offence she was alleged to have abetted. Counsel`s second main submission questioned whether the statement of facts tendered in this case did in fact support the charge against the petitioner. I therefore turn to examine this issue, for which I will set out the relevant facts.
The prosecution had to show first that Lim Teck Cheng, being entrusted as a director of Wyno with dominion over moneys belonging to it, had misappropriated the sum of $282,000 and thereby committed the actus reus of the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent of that company. The prosecution also had to show that the petitioner aided Lim Teck Cheng in performing the misappropriation by arranging for that company to pay to one Lee & Kong Engineering Works the said sum pursuant to the two invoices described in the charge. Further, the prosecution had to show that the petitioner did so intentionally - that is, with the intention that Lim Teck Cheng should misappropriate the moneys. The statement of facts tendered by the prosecution disclosed the following facts.
From 26 June 1989 the petitioner worked as an accountant in a company called Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd (`Hong Lam`). On 13 September 1989 she was appointed a director of that company, her fellow director being Lim Teck Cheng. On 13 February 1990 the petitioner was also appointed a director of Wyno, a recently formed company whose other directors were Lim Teck Cheng and one Koh Chye Heng.
In June 1990 Lim Teck Cheng told the petitioner and Koh Chye Heng that he had approached International Factors Marine (S) Pte Ltd (`IFM`) for a loan of $4.2m for the construction of a vessel, and that as a condition of the loan, Hong Lam had to show IFM that expenses of $500,000 had already been incurred by it in the construction of the vessel. Lim Teck Cheng said that Hong Lam could not fulfil this condition and after some discussion, it was agreed that Wyno should ask its subcontractors to issue false invoices, on which Wyno should pay them, after which they would simply return the money to Lim Teck Cheng.
In pursuance of this scheme, Lim Teck Cheng later specifically instructed the petitioner to obtain false invoices from Lee & Kong Engineering Works. On or around 20 June 1990 the petitioner signed two purchase orders, Nos WM102-3001 and WM102-3002, on behalf of Koh Chye Heng, from Wyno to Lee & Kong Engineering Works. Lee & Kong Engineering Works then issued their invoices, Nos 1267/90 for $240,000 and 1268/90 for $42,000 in respect of these purchase orders. On or around 22 June 1990 the petitioner raised a payment voucher No 067/06/90 for $282,000 in respect of the two invoices. Lim Teck Cheng, who controlled the moneys belonging to Wyno, issued a cheque for that sum. This was given to Lee & Kong Engineering Works, who promptly issued a cheque returning the sum to the petitioner, who in turn handed it back to Lim Teck Cheng. This cheque was encashed by Lim Teck Cheng and the moneys deposited in Hong Lam`s bank account.
On or around 27 June 1990 Lim Teck Cheng handed the petitioner a deposit slip dated that day for an amount of $298,500, informing her that this sum comprised the $282,000 returned by Lee & Kong Engineering Works and a $16,500 loan from `Winoso Trading`. He instructed the petitioner to record the total amount in the accounts of Hong Lam as a loan from himself and she did so. Before the petitioner left Hong Lam in 1991, she told Lim Teck Cheng that he should reverse the $282,000 that was recorded in Wyno`s accounts as construction costs of the vessel and in Hong Lam`s accounts as a loan. Up to the date the petitioner pleaded guilty, this had not been done.
This is the sum of the relevant facts in the prosecution`s statement of facts. The loss in the transaction was suffered by Wyno: $282,000 which originally belonged to Wyno became totally disengaged from that company, being transformed instead into a debt owed to Lim Teck Cheng by Hong Lam. The charge against the petitioner alleges that her abetment of Lim Teck Cheng`s criminal breach of trust took the form of arranging for Wyno to pay the $282,000 to Lee & Kong Engineering Works pursuant to the invoices. Yet it is not stated anywhere in the statement of facts that at the time the petitioner arranged for the said payment she knew that she would be asked to record the money returned from Lee & Kong Engineering Works as a loan to Hong Lam rather than as an asset belonging to Wyno. If anything, the statement of facts indicated that the petitioner would have thought that the money would be returned to Wyno, which would then have been no worse off than before the payment out was made. Her intention at the time she did the acts for which she was charged, namely, arranging for Wyno to pay the money to Lee & Kong Engineering Works pursuant to the two invoices dated 20 June 1990, was simply not addressed at all in the statement of facts.
This being the case, even if it is assumed in favour of the prosecution that the statement of facts did disclose the commission of the act/s constituting the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent alleged against Lim Teck Cheng, the petitioner has still not been proven to have intentionally aided the commission of such act/s. She has not been shown to have arranged for the payment to Lee & Kong Engineering Works with the intention that Lim Teck Cheng should misappropriate the moneys.
This alone is sufficient for my decision. The statement of facts hinted at an overall scheme devised to extract money wrongfully from IFM; alternately, the petitioner`s obedience to Lim Teck Cheng`s instructions to record the deposit in Hong Lam`s bank account as a loan might have been questionable. However, the statement of facts, as it stood, did not permit of more than mere conjecture as to these possibilities, nor did it disclose enough for a substitute charge to be sensibly drafted. This court cannot and will not, in the face of the limited material before it, take upon itself the duty of the prosecution either in deciding what charge might have been appropriate, or in plugging by surmise the deficiencies in the facts laid before it. For the same reasons, s 111 of the Penal Code, on the facts before the court, will not assist the prosecution in the absence of any factual or legal material on which this court may conclude that the alleged criminal breach of trust was a probable consequence of the aid rendered by the petitioner. From the facts which were disclosed, the activities described seem undeniably highly suspect. However, to say any more would be an unjustified exercise in speculation which cannot make up for an improperly drafted charge or statement of facts.
I would make one other observation. The charge itself was strictly improper. The relevant portions of s 405 of the Penal Code are as follows: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with ... any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates ... that property ... commits `criminal breach of trust`. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The charge in the present case alleged only that the petitioner `intentionally aided the said Lim Teck Cheng to dishonestly misappropriate the sum of $282,000`. There was no mention of the $282,000 being the property which Lim Teck Cheng was entrusted with dominion over, though this was in fact the case and there was ample and undisputed evidence as to this. That is, though Lim Teck Cheng was described in the charge as a director of Wyno who in such capacity was entrusted with dominion over property, namely, moneys belonging to Wyno, it was not also alleged in the charge that the salient $282,000 misappropriated were moneys belonging to Wyno. On the facts, this was a minor point and were it the sole objection to the proceedings against the petitioner would no doubt have merited little concern. As it is, the cumulative deficiencies in the prosecution case are not to be lightly regarded.
In all the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the proper course for me in the interests of justice would be to grant the petition and set aside the petitioner`s conviction. I do so accordingly. The costs of prosecution paid by the petitioner must be refunded to her.
