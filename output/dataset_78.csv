      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty before a magistrate to three offences and was committed for sentence to the District Court under the provisions of s 51A of the Justices Act. As a consequence, he appeared for sentence before Judge English on two counts of driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154A of the Crimes Act and one count of being in possession of car breaking implements contrary to s 114 of that Act. 
      
       
     3 In respect of each of the three offences for which he was committed for sentence there was an accompanying Form 1 containing matters to be taken into account under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, the formalities of s 33(2) were not attended to and the applicant was not asked whether he admitted his guilt to those matters or whether he wished them to be taken into account. Although no point has been taken concerning this irregularity, the criminal courts should be astute to comply with the procedural formalities attending to the steps towards sentencing. They are not empty gestures, but are important safeguards to ensure that the offender is aware of what is taking place and consents to procedures that may have a significant impact upon his freedom or the period during which he will remain in custody. 
      
       
     4 The matters for which the applicant was to be sentenced by her Honour, therefore, were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: Drive conveyance without consent 
          
         Form 1: 1. Drive whilst disqualified 
          
          2. State false name and address 
          
          3. Exceed speed limit by over 30kmph 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2: Possess car breaking implements 
          
         Form 1: 1. Drive whilst disqualified 
          
          2. Take and drive conveyance without consent 
          
          3. Stealing 
          
          4. Possess implements 
         
        
        
         
         Count 3: Drive conveyance without consent of owner 
          
         Form 1: 1. Exceed speed 
          
          2. State false name 
          
          3. Drive whilst disqualified 
         
        
       
     5 On 30 August 2001 her Honour sentenced the applicant on each of the three counts, and taking into account the Form 1 matters. The sentences imposed were corrected on 1 February 2002 and the result is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: Imprisonment for 30 months to date from 4 May 2001 with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 4 May 2001 and to expire 3 November 2002. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2: Imprisonment for 24 months to date from 4 May 2001 with a non-parol period of 18 months to expire on 3 November 2002. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 3: Imprisonment for 48 months to date from 4 May 2001 with a non-parole period of 24 months to expire on 3 May 2003. 
         
        
        
       That is an effective sentence of imprisonment for 4 years from 4 May 2001 with a non-parole period of 2 years. Her Honour also disqualified the applicant from driving until 31 January 2008. 
        
       
     6 Before considering the factual basis of each of the matters for which the applicant was sentenced, it should be noted that the applicant has a lengthy record for offences involving the illegal use of motor vehicles and motor traffic offences despite the fact that he is only 21 years of age. His record dates from 1996 in the Children’s Court and contains other offences of dishonesty apparently unconnected with motor vehicles. On my reckoning, before he was sentenced by her Honour, he had been before the courts for thirteen offences involving the illegal use of motor vehicles, twelve offences of drive whilst disqualified and two offences of possession of car breaking implements. 
      
       
     7 The applicant has served terms of imprisonment before the current sentences were imposed upon him. He was sentenced to imprisonment for drive whilst disqualified in 1999 and also placed on a three-year good behaviour bond for illegal use of a motor vehicle at that time. On 11 May 2000, for an offence of drive conveyance without consent of the owner, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was released to parole on 9 February 2001. 
      
       
     8 The first set of offences for which the applicant was before Judge English arose on 24 March 2001. In the early hours of that date the applicant was driving a stolen motor vehicle at a speed of 123 kph in a 90 kph zone when he was stopped by police. There were five other persons in the vehicle. The applicant told police he did not have his licence with him and gave a false name and address. However, when the applicant was informed that he would have to accompany police to verify his identity, he informed them of his real name. Inquiries revealed that he had been disqualified from driving and that the vehicle had been stolen 11 days earlier. The applicant told police he had purchased it for $200. The applicant was charged with a number of offences and released to bail. 
      
       
     9 On 13 April 2001 the applicant was driving a vehicle when he was pulled over to partake in a random breath test. Inquiries by police revealed that the vehicle had been stolen earlier that evening. The applicant told police that he had received the vehicle from a person he knew as “Mike” and had started it with a bent fork. The applicant was of course still disqualified from driving. The applicant was charged with a number of offences arising from this incident and was issued with a court attendance notice. These offences and two other matters committed in May of that year comprised the second set of matters for which Judge English sentenced the applicant. 
      
       
     10 The third set of matters before her Honour arose on 5 May 2001. On that date the applicant was again stopped in a motor vehicle while exceeding the speed limit. Once more he gave a false name to police. The vehicle had been stolen the day before and a bent fork, which had been used to start the ignition, was found in the motor vehicle. The applicant was refused bail on the charges arising from this incident and has remained in custody thereafter. 
      
       
     11 The obvious aggravating factor in the offences before her Honour was that they were all committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty of one sort or another. He was on parole when all the offences were committed and was also subject to existing good behaviour bonds for similar conduct. Further, the second and third sets of offences were committed while the applicant was on bail for the first set and the third while he was subject of a court attendance notice in respect of the second set. In light of the applicant’s record this was a case that, on the face of it, required a sentence of some severity both to act as a specific deterrent to the applicant and to protect the community from his continued criminal behaviour in relation to the theft and use of motor vehicles. 
      
       
     12 A pre-sentence report revealed the following information. The applicant had in the past accepted supervision from the Probation and Parole Service when offered to him, but intervention by the Service appeared to have little impact upon his offending behaviour. He had experienced a difficult upbringing marked by abuse and instability but enjoyed family support. The applicant was being treated for injuries suffered while in custody when he fell during a fit. He was undergoing medical tests to determine the cause of his fitting. He was assessed as unsuitable for both periodic detention and community service. 
      
       
     13 Medical reports placed before her Honour indicated that the applicant suffered from epilepsy and was being treated with Tegretol. He had been admitted to hospital on 16 April 2001 after reportedly drinking petrol because he felt depressed and wanted to commit suicide as he was facing gaol for stealing cars. It should be noted that a short time later he was again involved in that criminal activity. 
      
       
     14 The applicant’s sister gave evidence that her brother commenced receiving treatment for a mental disorder in 1996 after he had been charged with lighting fires. After his release from prison on parole, he came to live with her and their mother and was attempting to “get everything under control”. This witness suffers from a mild form of spinal bifida and the applicant helps her get around and makes appointments for her because she has memory problems. She said that the applicant had made a number of suicide attempts. She reported that a friend of the family had sexually assaulted the applicant when he was young. He had also been assaulted in gaol. 
      
       
     15 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said of the applicant’s offences and his criminal record: 
      
       
        
         
         His offences reflect simply dreadful conduct. The community has a rightful expectation that repeat offenders such as this will be dealt with by the Court in a responsible manner, and the Court will impose penalties which will reflect the community's disapprobation of car theft and driving offences. Those who earn money honestly and save or borrow to buy a motor vehicle, should be entitled to have an expectation that it will not be stolen by those who choose to flout the law and disregard the rights of honest people. Society is paying far too much for insurance premiums as a result of the activities of the likes of [the applicant]. 
          
          
         Normally an offender's past record must not be a ground for increasing sentences, but a predilection to commit the same offence as many times as this young offender, is a factor to be properly taken into account when sentencing him for further offences of a like nature. This is not to punish him for his past crimes, it is because the previous sentences passed have proved to be insufficient deterrent and, in my view, an increase in the length of sentence imposed is justified, if not in the offender's own interests, then certainly in the interests of motor vehicle owners in this community. 
         
        
       
     16 In my respectful opinion these two paragraphs reflect the proper approach to sentencing this applicant for these offences on the material then before the sentencing judge. This was a case of continued attitude of disobedience to the law such that, notwithstanding the applicant’s youth and unfortunate background, a severe sentence was warranted in an endeavour to deter the applicant and protect the community, see Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. 
      
       
     17 The grounds of appeal relied upon can be summarised as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in proceeding on the basis that the maximum sentence for the offence of Drive without the Consent of the Owner was ten years imprisonment. 
          
         2. The discount allowed by the learned sentencing Judge for the plea of guilty was inadequate in the circumstances. 
          
         3. The learned sentencing Judge erred in giving insufficient weight to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
          
         4. The sentence(s) are manifestly excessive in the circumstances. 
          
         
        
       
     18 The first ground of appeal contends that her Honour erred in proceeding on the basis of the wrong maximum penalty for the offence in the first and third counts and on the Form 1 in relation to the second count. The applicant was charged with offences under s 154A of the Crimes Act and that section prescribes a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment. Unfortunately her Honour was misinformed that this offence carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and sentenced the applicant accordingly. Twice during her sentencing remarks her Honour referred to this being the maximum penalty for the offences in the first and second counts. Further, the error would appear to account for the fact that the sentence imposed for the second set of matters is less than the other two notwithstanding that the objective criminality appears to be greater. 
      
       
     19 The Crown concedes this error occurred but submits that the sentence should not be varied because a more lenient sentence is not “warranted in law”, see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act and R v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311. The Crown submits that the sentence imposed upon the applicant must reflect the fact that the applicant faced a total maximum sentence of 17 years imprisonment for the offences before the sentencing judge and that any sentence imposed had to take into account both specific and general deterrence. 
      
       
     20 In my view the Court must interfere to correct the sentences imposed upon the applicant for two reasons; firstly, because her Honour’s error has clearly affected the structure of the sentences imposed and secondly because the structure of the sentences does not, in any event, accord with the sentencing principle enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. It was not appropriate for her Honour to impose concurrent sentences and simply reflect the totality of the criminality by increasing the last sentence to be served. The last set of offences, as serious as they were, could not justify a sentence of four years after a plea of guilty, notwithstanding the aggravating feature that the applicant was on parole and bail at the time they were committed. Her Honour should have given appropriate penalties for each set of offences and then made orders as to the commencement of the sentences to reflect the total criminality involved. 
      
       
     21 Judges of the District Court must understand that the principle in Pearce is considered by this Court to be fundamental to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion, see R v AEM (Snr) [2002] NSWCCA 58. A failure to comply with it will almost inevitably mean that this Court will be required to allow an appeal and vary the sentence. This will usually involve the Court re-exercising the sentencing discretion that resided in the sentencing judge and very often fresh material will need to be taken into account which may result in the sentence being reduced. This is clearly a waste of the valuable resources of the criminal courts in this State and inimical to the interests of justice. 
      
       
     22 In this case material is now before the Court that clearly should have been placed before the District Court. It was evident from the psychiatric records before her Honour and the evidence from the applicant’s sister that there was some matter of the applicant’s mental or emotional state that needed to be investigated. Yet this was one of the apparently few cases in which a report upon the applicant’s mental state was not obtained by the defence. 
      
       
     23 A psychiatric report has been tendered to this Court on the basis that it may be necessary to re-sentence the applicant. It discloses that the applicant’s fits are most probably the result of an anxiety disorder with panic attacks and pseudo-seizures rather than epilepsy. However, the psychiatrist believes that the applicant’s principal psychiatric diagnosis was post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of witnessing the murder of a childhood friend. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he used cars that he stole as an “escape route” to get away from what the applicant described as “intense situations”. The psychiatrist assessed the applicant as having long-standing and serious psychiatric problems that he believed played a part in his offending. He thought that a change in the applicant’s behaviour was unlikely unless he is afforded appropriate treatment along with supervision and support on his release. 
      
       
     24 Be that as it may, the offences committed by the applicant and his flagrant disregard of court orders merits a sentence in the order of that imposed by Judge English. The psychiatric report does little to diminish the objective seriousness of his conduct although it may explain what motivates him to behave as his does. Her Honour’s sentencing remarks stressed the importance of personal deterrence and the protection of the community, and those are still the most important matters when determining the appropriate sentence notwithstanding the new psychiatric material. Her Honour gave the applicant the advantage of a finding of special circumstances based upon his age, mental health problems and the need for a lengthy supervised period of rehabilitation. The new material merely confirms that her Honour was correct in her approach notwithstanding the applicant’s constant failure to abide by conditions imposed upon his liberty. 
      
       
     25 In my view there is no substance in the other grounds of appeal. The overall sentence is simply the appropriate one and, in particular, the non-parole period of 2 years is the very least that could be imposed upon the applicant to mark the court’s disapproval of his conduct, protect the public and deter him from further behaviour of this kind. They were serious offences of their nature and deserved a sentence towards the upper end of the maximum penalty available. Since Judge English sentenced the applicant, his parole has been revoked and he is serving the balance of that sentence concurrently with the sentences for these offences. 
      
       
     26 On the hearing of the appeal a further matter was raised which was not reflected in the grounds of appeal or the written submissions originally filed. It concerns the length of the applicant’s disqualification from holding a driver’s licence. Although the Court received some oral submissions on the matter, the parties were granted leave to file further written submissions in respect of the point and judgment was then reserved. Each of the parties filed further written submissions and I have taken them into account. 
      
       
     27 Her Honour stated the following in respect of the period of disqualification to be ordered as part of the sentence she was imposing upon the applicant: 
      
       
        
         
          
         At the time the offences, for which you have been sentenced, were committed, you were disqualified from holding a New South Wales Drivers Licence until 30 January 2004. Your driving record is the worst that I have ever seen for a young man just 20 years old. Not only have you never held a driver’s licence and choose to drive whilst disqualified on 13 occasions, but you also have no regard for road rules. You have been dealt with for driving furiously or recklessly, in a dangerous manner and at speed dangerous on three occasions, and you have failed to stop after an accident. Your driving record demonstrates a persistent refusal to appreciate the responsibility with regard to the laws designed to protect road users of this State. 
          
          
         Accordingly, in respect of each of the offences contained on the schedules, I impose the automatic period of disqualification of two years in respect of each offence, which effectively means that you will be disqualified from obtaining a driver’s licence until 31 January 2008. 
         
        
       
     28 There were three offences of drive whilst disqualified before her Honour, one on each Form 1 to be taken into account on each of the three charges for which the applicant was to be sentenced. Section 34 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
          
         34(1) If a court takes a further offence into account under this Division, the court may make such ancillary orders as it could have made had it convicted the offender of the offence when it took the offence into account, but may not impose a separate penalty for the offence. 
          
         (2)  
          
         (3)  
          
         (4) In this section, “ancillary order” means an order or direction with respect to restitution, compensation, costs, forfeiture, disqualification or loss or suspension of a licence or privilege. 
         
        
        
       Therefore, by taking into account the three offences of drive while disqualified, the sentencing judge was empowered to make orders in respect of the further disqualification of the applicant as if he had been convicted of each offence. However, s 35(4) of that  
       Act 
        states: 
        
        
         
         (4) An offence taken into account under this Division is not, merely because of its being taken into account, to be regarded for any purpose as an offence of which an offender has been convicted. 
         
        
       
     29 Section 25A(1) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 provides for an offence of driving while disqualified from holding a driver licence. Subsections (7), (8) and (10) of that Section provide: 
      
       
        
         
          
         (7) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3)(a), the person: 
          
           
            
             
             (a) is disqualified by the conviction (and without any specific order) for the relevant disqualification period from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification or suspension or from the date of such conviction, whichever is the later, from holding a driver licence, and 
              
             (b) may also be disqualified, for such additional period as the court may order, from holding a driver licence. 
             
            
           
          
         (8) The disqualification referred to in subsection (7) is in addition to any penalty imposed for the offence. 
          
          
         (10) In this section, the relevant disqualification period is: 
          
           
           (a) in the case of a first offence under subsection (1),(2) or (3)(a) —12 months, or 
            
           (b) in the case of a second or subsequent offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3)(a)—2 years. 
           
          
         
        
        
       In the present case, the relevant disqualification period, which would apply had the applicant been convicted of an offence of drive whilst disqualified, was 2 years, as each of the offences taken into account by her Honour were “second or subsequent offences”, see subs (6). 
        
       
     30 Her Honour indicated that she was making an order disqualifying the applicant for “the automatic period of disqualification”, that being 2 years in respect of each offence. Her Honour therefore disqualified the applicant for a further four years from 30 January 2004 the date upon which the applicant’s then period of disqualification expired and indicated that the applicant was further disqualified until 30 January 2008. However, her Honour’s calculations were clearly erroneous. The statutory disqualification period would have been 6 years, being 2 years in respect of each of the three offences, to be served cumulatively between themselves and cumulative on the existing disqualification period. Had her Honour made the orders she apparently intended, the applicant should have been disqualified until 30 January 2010. 
      
       
     31 However, the application made in respect of the disqualification period before this Court was not based upon the order made by her Honour, which was unduly favourable to the applicant. Rather the application was based upon the attitude taken by the Road Transport Authority (the RTA) to the traffic record of the applicant and, in particular, the orders made by Judge English. A letter sent by the RTA to the applicant and dated 21 September 2002 was tendered on behalf of the applicant on the hearing of this appeal without objection by the Crown. The substance of that letter was as follows: 
      
       
        
        HABITUAL TRAFFIC OFFENDER DECLARATION 
         
         
        Advice of Declaration under the Habitual Traffic Offender's legislation 
         
         
        Road Transport (General) Act (Part 3, Division 4) 
         
        
        
        
       Advice has been received that you recently committed traffic offences which are affected by the above legislation (see over for more details). As a result, your driving record indicates that with the recent offences, you have committed three or more relevant offences within a five-year period. Therefore, the law requires that you be declared an Habitual Traffic Offender. 
        
        
       As a consequence, the law operates to apply a mandatory five-year period of disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver's licence for each declaration imposed, unless the court, at the time of your conviction, decides otherwise. The disqualification period imposed against you for each declaration will not commence until all other periods of disqualification have expired. 
        
        
       The relevant offence details that led to the declaration(s) and habitual offender disqualification(s) are listed on the reverse side of this letter. 
        
       
     32 On the reverse side of the letter there is set out information concerning the declaration of an habitual traffic offender, what action might be taken by a person subject to such a declaration and what the consequences of the declaration would be if the person continued to drive. 
      
       
     33 There then follows a table with the following headings: ""Offence particulars""; “Court”; “Court Date”; “Disq until & including"". It is unnecessary for present purposes to set out the matters contained in the table under each of these headings. It is sufficient to indicate that the table includes, amongst the items listed under the heading ""Offence particulars"", the three offences of drive while disqualified dealt with by Judge English. They can be identified by reference to the corresponding entries specifying the court and court date. Beneath each one of these entries is listed an item ""habitual offender declared"". Alongside each of these items, under the heading “Court”, is shown “Gosford”, and, under the heading ""Court Date"", is shown “30-08-2001”. Beneath each of these entries are the words “Disq for five years until"" and under the last column headed “Disq until & including"" there is a date specified. In respect of the first of these three entries, the date specified is ""30-01-2019"", in respect of the second, the date specified is ""31-01-2008"", and, in respect of the third, the date specified is ""30-01-2029"". 
      
       
     34 In order to understand what was intended to be conveyed by the entries set out in this table, it is necessary to refer briefly to the provisions of the Road Transport (General) Act concerned with habitual traffic offender declarations. 
      
       
     35 Sections 27and 28 of that Act provide as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         27(1) In this Division, a “relevant offence” means: 
          
           
           (a) any of the following offences committed after the commencement of this Division of which a person has been convicted by a court in this State: 
            
             
             (i) a major offence, 
              
             (ii) a prescribed speeding offence, 
              
             (iii) an offence under section 25(3) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998, 
              
             (iv) an offence under section 25A(1), (2) or (3) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998, or 
             
            
           (b) an offence committed after the commencement of this Division of which a person has been convicted by a court in another State or Territory that would be an offence of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) if it had been committed in this State, or 
            
           (c) a relevant offence within the meaning of section 10EA of the Traffic Act 1909 as in force immediately before its repeal. 
           
          
         (2) A relevant offence includes an offence of the kind referred to in subsection (1)(a) in respect of which the charge is found proven, or a person is found guilty, (but without proceeding to a conviction) under section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, or section 556A of the Crimes Act 1900, if the offence would, if it were a relevant offence, give rise to the declaration of the person under this Division as an habitual traffic offender. In that case, a reference in this Division to the conviction of the person for a relevant offence includes a reference to the making of an order with respect to the person. 
          
          
         28 A person is, by this section, declared to be an habitual traffic offender if: 
          
           
           (a) a court in this State convicts the person of a relevant offence, and 
            
           (b) the person has, in the period of 5 years before the conviction, also been convicted of at least 2 other relevant offences committed on different occasions. 
           
          
         
        
       
     36 The consequence of an habitual traffic offender declaration is set out in s 30 of the Act which states: 
      
       
        
         
          
         30(1) If a person is declared by section 28 to be an habitual traffic offender, the person is disqualified by the declaration (and without any specific order of a court) for a period of 5 years from holding a driver licence, except as provided by this Division. 
          
         (2) If the court that convicts the person of the offence giving rise to the declaration thinks fit, the court may order a longer period of disqualification (including disqualification for life). 
          
         (3) If the court that convicts the person of the offence giving rise to the declaration determines that a 5-year disqualification is a disproportionate and unjust consequence having regard to the total driving record of the person and the special circumstances of the case, the court may order a shorter period of disqualification (but not shorter than 2 years). 
          
         (4) If a court orders a shorter or longer period of disqualification, the court must state its reasons for doing so. 
          
         (5) A declaration of an habitual traffic offender ceases to be in force when the period of disqualification imposed by the declaration is completed. 
          
         (6) The period of any disqualification under this Division does not commence until all other disqualifications, and all other periods of licence cancellation or suspension, imposed on the person by or under this or any other Act have been completed. 
          
         (7) Further declarations have effect under this Division even though they occur while an existing declaration is in force, and the consequent periods of disqualification do not commence until all existing disqualifications under this Division have been completed. It does not matter that some of the relevant offences giving rise to a further declaration also gave rise to an earlier declaration. 
          
         (8) If, while an existing disqualification under this Division is in force, the person is disqualified by a court or automatically under another provision of this or any other Act, that further disqualification does not commence until all existing disqualifications under this Division have been completed. 
          
         
        
       
     37 In addition to the power of the court convicting the offender to reduce the period of disqualification consequent upon an habitual traffic offender declaration under subs 30(3), that court has a further power in order to avoid injustice arising from the automatic nature of a declaration under s 28. Section 31 of the Act provides: 
      
       
        
         
          
         31(1) The declaration of a person as an habitual traffic offender by section 28 may be quashed by a court that convicts the person of a relevant offence (at the time of the conviction or at a later time) if it determines that the disqualification imposed by the declaration is a disproportionate and unjust consequence having regard to the total driving record of the person and the special circumstances of the case. 
          
         (2) If a court quashes a declaration under this section, the court must state its reasons for doing so. 
          
         (3) However, a declaration or disqualification under this Division cannot be appealed to any court whether under this or any other Act. 
         
        
       
     38 The effect of these sections is that, if a person is convicted of a relevant offence, and his or her traffic record is such as to bring the person within subs 28(b), the person, is by operation of s 28, declared to be an habitual traffic offender. The consequence of that declaration is that the person is thereby disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for a period of 5 years cumulative upon any disqualification period existing at the time of the declaration. Each time a declaration occurs, by reason of a conviction of a relevant offence, a further period of disqualification of 5 years is added to the disqualification period in existence at the time of the declaration. Hence in the present case, it was the view of the RTA that, when her Honour took into account each of the offences of drive whilst disqualified, the result was a declaration under s 28 carrying with it an additional 5 years disqualification over and above that which was ordered by her Honour. The RTA calculated that the applicant was disqualified until 30 January 2029. 
      
       
     39 The issue raised before this Court was not a review of the determinations made by the RTA as to the operation of the relevant provisions of the Road Transport (General) Act. This Court would clearly have no power to undertake such a review. Rather, counsel for the applicant relied upon subs 30(3) of that Act and the power of the court convicting a person of a relevant traffic offence to specify a disqualification period other than the period of 5 years that would automatically flow from an habitual traffic offender declaration. It was argued that, if this Court interfered with the sentences imposed by Judge English, this Court was then the court convicting the applicant and so this Court had power to specify a period of disqualification in respect of each declaration that flowed from each conviction. It was submitted that this Court should take that course in order to aid in the rehabilitation of the applicant particularly having regard to the psychiatric material now before the Court. 
      
       
     40 The flaw in this argument was exposed in the written submissions filed by the Crown after judgment was reserved. It is now accepted by counsel for the applicant that there has been no conviction for the offences of drive whilst disqualified which her Honour took into account under the provisions of Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, see s 35(4) above. Section 27(2) of the Road Transport (General) Act, set out above, has no application because that section is clearly confined to orders made under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As there has been no conviction in respect of any of these offences, s 28 of the Road Transport (General) Act has not been engaged and, thus, no habitual traffic offender declaration can occur in respect of them. It follows that s 30 of that Act has no application. 
      
       
     41 The only question then that now arises in respect of the disqualification of the applicant from holding a driver licence, is whether this Court should interfere with the order made by Judge English, which, as I have already indicated, did not give effect to what her Honour intended, and increase the period of disqualification ordered by her Honour. Given that the period of disqualification is a penalty additional to the sentences imposed by her Honour and that this Court will not generally increase a penalty imposed upon an applicant in the absence of a Crown appeal, in my view, this Court should not interfere with the order of disqualification made by Judge English. 
      
       
     42 The examination of the provisions of the legislation referred to above indicates that care should be taken by the prosecuting authorities when determining whether serious motor traffic offences should be taken into account under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, especially where the offender has a traffic record as bad as the applicant. By the prosecution agreeing that the offences of drive whilst disqualified be taken into account on sentence, the applicant was permitted to escape from the habitual traffic offender provisions which clearly ought to have applied, to some degree at least, in his case. 
      
       
     43 I would grant the applicant leave to appeal and allow the appeal only to the extent of restructuring the sentences imposed by her Honour. I propose that the sentences imposed by her Honour be quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. In respect of Count 1 and taking the matters on the Form 1 into account, a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to date from 4 May 2001 and to expire on 3 May 2002. 
         
        
        
         
         2. In respect of Count 3 and taking the matters on the Form 1 into account, a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 4 May 2002 and to expire on 3 May 2003. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In respect of Count 2 and taking the matters on the Form 1 into account, imprisonment for 2½ years to commence on 4 November 2002. There is to be a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 3 may 2003 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. There is to be a condition of parole that he place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentences which were imposed by her Honour Balla DCJ in the District Court, on 27 May 2002, in relation to three offences of supplying a prohibited drug pursuant to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  
      
       
     2 The applicant was convicted of two of those offences, which related respectively to the deemed supply of 3.68 grams of methylamphetamine, and 42.5 ecstasy tablets, having a value of between $1260 and $1680 following trial. He pleaded guilty to the remaining charge involving 42.6 grams of cannabis leaf. He was sentenced to a fixed term of two years in relation to the methylamphetamine offence, to four years with a non-parole period of two years for the ecstasy offence, and to a fixed term of eighteen months for the cannabis offence. 
      
       
     3 The facts giving rise to the offences, as well as the subjective circumstances of the applicant, are sufficiently set out in the reasons for sentence in which her Honour comprehensively and correctly, in my view, took into account all relevant matters, including the applicant’s remorse, his cooperation with police, and the fact which was pressed in support of this application, that he had been making positive efforts since his arrest to change his lifestyle. 
      
       
     4 In substance, the applicant submits that error occurred in her Honour’s assessment of the relative seriousness of the offences, given the limited quantity of drugs involved; in not making sufficient allowance for the circumstance that the applicant was a user of both ecstasy and amphetamine; in assuming that, as a dealer, exceptional circumstances needed to be established before a non-custodial sentence could be imposed; and in imposing a sentence that was manifestly excessive for an offence involving cannabis leaf. 
      
       
     5 In support of the first of these propositions, comparison was invited with cases involving the importation of large quantities of ecstasy tablets, such as Regina v Ziggy Hauser, NSWCCA 11 December 1997, which it was appropriately submitted were in a totally different league. That is clearly correct but so far as I can see, little follows from it. The sentencing judge did not seek to equate the applicant’s criminality with that of those involved in such cases. 
      
       
     6 It was also submitted, having regard to the limited quantity of the drugs involved, that each matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court. While that is correct, and while that was a matter properly to be taken into account both by her Honour and by us on appeal, it is not the law that the maximum sentences available were those that could have been imposed in the Local Court. Regina v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297. The sentencing exercise in this case needed to be approached by reference to the fact that the applicant had three separate prohibited substances in his possession, and that such possession was either found by the jury, or admitted by the plea, to have been for the purposes of supply. 
      
       
     7 In relation to the position of the applicant as a user, that was a factual issue left to the jury and rejected by it, so far as it had been asserted that he had the drugs in his possession solely for personal use. It is obvious that the sentencing judge approached the case upon the basis that the drugs were in his possession for supply. 
      
       
     8 This Court is a court of error, not a factual review, and I see no justification for coming to any different conclusion. Indeed, that invited, namely that by and large the ecstasy was for the applicant’s own use, would amount to pure speculation. Particularly is that so, when attention is paid to the evidence concerning the drugs, which were contained in a carry bag which the applicant had with him when stopped by police, and concerning the discovery of resealable plastic bags and a set of scales in his premises. 
      
       
     9 So far as it was submitted that the applicant’s criminality was mitigated by the circumstance that he had been dealing to feed an addiction, a matter which can be taken into account in appropriate circumstances, as noted in Regina v Bernath 1997 1 VR 271, and Regina v Selim NSWCCA 19 May 1998, he faces the problem that this was the very opposite of the evidence which he gave, to the effect that all of the drugs were for his own use and that he was not selling. Moreover, there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that he had an addiction as distinct from a habit, albeit a longstanding one, of using recreationally on weekends. 
      
       
     10 Having regard to the nature of the drugs involved and the fact that there were three offences, I am unpersuaded that the case was one which would have been appropriate for a non-custodial sentence.  
      
       
     11 In order to succeed, the applicant must show that some sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed. Regina v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 722-721 and Regina v Kirikian [2002] NSWCCA 422, at para 24.  
      
       
     12 Although the sentences were at the top of the range, particularly for the cannabis offence, I am not persuaded that this threshold has been passed, or that the applicant’s subjective circumstances were not properly catered for by a particularly favourable non-parole period.  
      
       
     13 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     14 DOWD J: I agree. 
      
       
     15 BELL J: I also agree. 
      
       
     16 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v PETER DAVID CARR 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 LEVINE J: On 13 September each member of the Bench expressed concurrence with an order that the Crown appeal be dismissed.  
      
       
     2 My reasons for coming to this view as to the outcome of the Crown appeal coincide in general terms with those expressed by Howie J. I gratefully accept his Honour’s recitation of the factual background and the matters of principle against which the submissions are to be judged. 
      
       
     3 In relation to the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and the statement of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 624, I expressly state my concurrence with Howie J’s statement that what that decision requires is that the sentencing judge fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then determines whether to accumulate them in whole or in part “to reflect the totality of the criminality” (paragraph 26). This formulation properly reflects, in my respectful view, what is to be understood by the statement of the High Court: “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality” (emphasis added). Using the words of Howie J it can be seen that the statement of the High Court properly can be described as one of “fundamental principle” (see R v AEM (Snr) [2002] NSW CCA 58 paragraph 65). 
      
       
     4 As was said in R v AEM (Snr) at paragraph 70: 
      
       
        
         
         “The principle of totality can be simply stated. It requires that the effective sentence imposed upon an offender represent a proper period of incarceration for the total criminality involved. In  
         R v Kalache  
         (2000) 111 A Crim R 152, Sully J at 184 quoted from Thomas,  
         Principles of Sentencing 
         , 2nd Ed 1979 at 56-57:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""... [the Court] must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.""  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         See also  
         Mill v The Queen 
          (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63”.  
         
        
        
       It is to be noted that  
       Mill 
        is relied upon as authority for the cited passage from  
       Pearce 
       , above. 
        
       
     5 Thus it can be observed that the initial “Pearce” step, namely the fixing of a sentence in respect of each offence, is critical. The further “Pearce” step is the determination of the question of “totality”. The resolution of that second question may or may not require cumulation in whole or in part. It is in my view too easy for an appellate court to come to the view that a sentence considered by it subjectively to be lenient is therefore erroneous merely because there has been no cumulation in whole or in part. 
      
       
     6 I agree that in circumstances where specific submissions have been made by one party or the other (here, the Crown) on the question of cumulation, the sentencing judge should be otherwise than silent on that aspect of the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     7 I add that what I will call the “unity of the occasion of sentencing” namely the one judge sentencing the one offender on the one occasion in respect of more than one offence should not be permitted improperly to intrude upon the correct application of principle. 
      
       
     8 Sentencing for the kinds of offences the subject of this application must not overlook the simple fact that the conduct is such as the offenders in positions of trust who conduct themselves in the way this applicant has are “criminals” and I agree with Howie J’s observations in paragraph 40 of his reasons (see Regina v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353). 
      
       
     9 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his Honour’s reasons. I also agree with the observations of Levine J. 
      
       
     10 HOWIE J: This matter was heard by this Court on 13 September 2002. On that date I indicated my agreement with an order that this appeal by the Crown should be dismissed. The following are my reasons for coming to that view. 
      
       
     11 On 16 May 2002 the respondent was sentenced by his Honour Judge Herron for two offences in respect of which he had pleaded guilty under the provisions of s 51A of the Justices Act. The first offence was contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act and charged that being a director of a body corporate the respondent defrauded that company. The maximum penalty prescribed for that offence is 10 years imprisonment. The second offence was fraudulent misappropriation contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty in respect of such an offence is imprisonment for 7 years. 
      
       
     12 In respect of the first offence the respondent was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 16 May 2002 with a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 15 May 2004 the date upon which the respondent will be eligible to be released to parole. In respect of the second offence the respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence on 16 May 2002 and to expire on 15 May 2004. 
      
       
     13 By notice of appeal dated 10 July 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the sentences imposed upon the respondent on the basis that they were manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     14 The first offence was alleged to have been committed between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 1996. During that period the respondent, who was then a solicitor, held the position of director of two related companies, Spencer Gulf Telecasters Limited and J.M. Sturrock Pty Ltd (“Sturrock”). The respondent was also retained by Sturrock to provide legal advice on television broadcasting legislation and to assist in the preparation of various submissions to the government on such legislation and broadcasting regulations. The respondent was not paid a fixed amount as a retainer but was reimbursed for the work and time that he expended in giving this legal advice in accordance with invoices that he produced to the company. In addition he was paid a director’s fee of $15,000. 
      
       
     15 During this period the respondent had custody and control of the financial records of Sturrock including the company’s chequebook. The respondent was authorised to draw cheques for matters within the normal operation of the company’s day-to-day business. In June 1996 the company’s accountant sought information from the respondent in order to complete financial statements and income tax returns. The respondent delayed in forwarding that information to such an extent that the accountant’s concerns were raised with the other director of the company. 
      
       
     16 Eventually the respondent complied with the request made of him, and the records forwarded to the accountant revealed matters of concern in the company’s financial accounts. As a result a complete review was conducted of the financial records of Sturrock and a number of discrepancies discovered. These related to excessive charges for services rendered by the respondent, duplicates of charges together with other excessive drawings made on the company’s bank accounts. When questioned about these matters, the respondent indicated that some of these drawings were advances against future fees while others were merely errors on his part. As a result of the respondent’s fraudulent activities, he had paid to himself from the company’s funds the sum of $321,666 to which he was not entitled. 
      
       
     17 The matter was not immediately reported to the police. Rather, the respondent and his wife were required to enter into a deed whereby they acknowledged their liability to the company in respect of the amount defrauded and promised to repay it. The respondent was also required to resign as a director of the companies. However, no repayment was made until 29 June 2001 when a cheque for $85,800 was paid to Sturrock on behalf of the respondent, that money being derived from the sale of a property owned by the respondent and his wife at Hawkes Nest. 
      
       
     18 The second offence arose from the respondent’s association with a company called Danglass Pty Ltd (“Danglass”). That company was involved in a property development that resulted in a large number of townhouses and home units being sold under a company called Stronach Pty Ltd. In 1998 the respondent was retained as a consultant solicitor for Danglass and his duties involved the preparation of contracts, conveyancing and other legal duties involved in the establishment and the sale of the development. In particular the respondent acted for the company on the sale of about thirty townhouses. The purchase price was to be paid into a trust account held by a real estate agent for the development or in the trust account of the respondent until the monies were ultimately forwarded to Danglass. 
      
       
     19 On 28 June 2000 the solicitor of one of the purchasers of a townhouse in the development contacted the respondent and indicated that the purchasers wished to settle the matter prior to 1 July 2000 in order to avoid the imminent Goods and Services Tax. The respondent advised the solicitor that a cheque should be made out in his name and sent to him. On 29 June 2000 the respondent received a cheque for the outstanding money owing for the purchase being $358,952.68. The respondent immediately deposited that cheque into his personal bank account. He failed to notify any person from Danglass that the settlement had occurred or that the payment had been made. For some period thereafter the accused indicated to persons from Danglass, who were inquiring as to the settlement of the matter, that it was imminent but had not occurred. 
      
       
     20 On 21 March 2001 the directors of Danglass became aware that settlement of the property had taken place the previous year and that the money had been paid to the respondent. The next day the respondent was confronted with this information and confirmed that it was true. When asked what he did with the money, he replied, “I put it in my bank account for my own use. I am sorry.” When asked what he had spent it on, the respondent replied, “Lifestyle.” He was asked if there was any money left and he said, “About $30,000, I spent the rest.” The respondent was taken to the branch of the Building Society where he maintained an account and he handed over a Building Society account passbook and a cheque payable to Danglass for $30,966.56. 
      
       
     21 The respondent was arrested in respect of the offence committed against Danglass on 20 April 2001 after he voluntarily attended the Newcastle Police Station. A short time later complaint was made to the police in relation to the offence committed against Sturrock and the respondent was charged with that offence as well. 
      
       
     22 The respondent declined to be interviewed by the police and did not give evidence before the sentencing judge. As a result there was little evidence to explain what had happened to the money that the respondent had obtained as a result of the offences. The respondent told a psychiatrist, who prepared a report for the sentencing court, that he had spent the money obtained from Danglass to repay a debt on the holiday house at Hawkes Nest. The psychiatrist reported: 
      
       
        
         
          
         Mr Carr said that he had ‘great parents’. His mother, in particular, idolises him. He said that ""She will do anything for me"". She even hand tailored his suits. It is obvious that his mother has great dreams for him as a famous and successful individual. Subsequently, Mr Carr has always strived to meet that ideal because ""I just cannot disappoint my mother"". His mother was particularly proud of him when he worked for Spencer Gulf Telecasters Ltd. She was proud of his somewhat glamorous lifestyle of flying around negotiating various business deals. He in turn thrived on her admiration. It seems that he cannot separate himself from her fantasies. Mr Carr has a great capacity for denial. He copes with life problems by ignoring them, thereby creating an alternate reality which others would perceive as lies. The more he is stressed, the more he retreats into a world of self-deception. He also goes into a state of inaction when stress strikes. As a result, his problems become bigger and more insurmountable. 
         
        
       
     23 The respondent’s wife gave evidence before the sentencing judge but she could throw little light on either the motivation of the respondent for committing the offences or what had happened to the proceeds. It was her opinion that the respondent had no ability to manage money and that he tended to fantasise in relation to his financial situation. She indicated that she was not aware of circumstances in which the respondent left his position with Sturrock although she thought that it was because of a dispute over fees. She said that she agreed to sign the deed because her husband had told her that, if she did not, Sturrock would go to the Law Society. The respondent’s wife gave evidence that she received no money from the sale of the Hawkes Nest property after it was sold in June 2001. 
      
       
     24 The respondent is aged 49 years. He is married and has three children, a son aged 17 and twin daughters aged 15. His wife gave evidence that she was confident that her relationship with the respondent would survive his incarceration and that both she and he had received marriage counselling after the disclosure of the offences. She believed that since the respondent’s arrest he accepted reality and realised the seriousness of his conduct. She said that she would support the respondent and insist that he undergo any therapy necessary to help him overcome his denial. She gave evidence that the family finances were “a shambles” and she anticipated having to sell their home. 
      
       
     25 The psychiatric report indicated that, since the respondent’s arrest, he had been suffering from an adjustment disorder with anxious mood. The respondent was receiving two different forms of psychiatric treatment: he was being prescribed anti-depressant medication for depression and receiving psychotherapy to help him confront his denial. The psychiatrist indicated that the respondent needed long-term therapy in order for him to confront his problems and that his prognosis was moderately good. 
      
       
     26 There was also before the sentencing judge a reference from the Dean of Newcastle detailing the respondent’s involvement with Christchurch Cathedral in Newcastle and his participation in its community activities. The respondent had given generously of his time and resources both to the cathedral and to the Newcastle Grammar School where his children have attended as students. 
      
       
     27 There was also tendered a letter from the General Manager, Corporate Affairs for Prime Television Ltd indicating that the company intended to continue to use the services of the respondent when he was released from custody. 
      
       
     28 The major thrust of the appeal by the Director of Public Prosecution is the contention that it was erroneous for his Honour to have made the sentence for the second charge totally concurrent with the sentence for the first charge, it being a separate and serious act of criminality committed in entirely different circumstances and against a different victim than that in the first offence. It was submitted that as a result the sentence imposed failed to comply with the proper approach for sentencing for multiple offences as laid down in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     29 Mr Byrne SC for the respondent has challenged the last assertion, particularly having regard to the respondent’s age and character. He relies upon the extensive delay in the prosecution of the first, and more serious of the offences as a mitigating matter. In this regard he relies upon the decision of this Court in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 where the importance of fairness to the offender was stressed in cases of extensive delay between offence and sentence. In the present case the defrauding of Sturrock was discovered in 1996 but he was not charged until 2001. 
      
       
     30 In that regard the sentencing judge found the failure of the victim of the first offence to report the matter to police as “a little unsettling”. I do not view it in the same light. It seems to me to have been a compassionate course adopted by the owner of the business in recognition of the lengthy and valuable service performed by the respondent to him and his father over a number of years. The owner even took the step of refusing to co-operate with the investigation by the law society into the conduct of the respondent, presumably in the hope that the respondent would be able to retain his practicing certificate. I do not have any difficulty in understanding why, when the respondent proved himself unworthy of such consideration by again defrauding a client, that the matter was then reported to police. It should be noted that, notwithstanding that no money had been repaid to Sturrock until after the respondent’s arrest for the second offence, no action had been taken against him to enforce the deed. 
      
       
     31 I do not believe that the circumstance of the delay in this case is of very great moment in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the first offence. There is nothing that indicates that the delay worked any injustice upon the respondent or had a significant detrimental impact upon him. But I accept Mr Byrne’s argument that the sentence imposed for that criminality, in light of the respondent’s plea and the delay in prosecution could not be said to be inadequate punishment for that offence. The maximum penalty was 10 years the sentence imposed was four years. Having regard to the length of time over which the acts giving rise to the offence occurred, the serious breach of trust involved (in that the respondent was both a solicitor and a director of the company), the amount of money involved and importance of general deterrence the sentence was an appropriate one for that offence. 
      
       
     32 I cannot however, accept the submission that the sentence imposed was appropriate to meet the overall criminality that was before his Honour and in my view that is because of the failure of his Honour to impose a cumulative sentence for the second offence. I acknowledge that it is a matter for the exercise of discretion whether a sentence for one offence should be made cumulative or concurrent on the sentence for another offence: Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]. I also acknowledge that this Court must exercise restraint in interfering with the exercise of that discretion particularly when it is asked to do so on an appeal by the Crown; R v Institoris [2002] NSWCCA 8 at [95]. 
      
       
     33 But with unfeigned respect to the sentencing judge, who is very experienced in sentencing as in other aspects of the criminal law, his Honour does not appear to have turned his mind to this issue. It was accepted on the hearing of the appeal that the Crown had made a submission to his Honour that the sentences for the offences should be cumulative. The sentencing remarks are lengthy and detailed in respect of both factual aspects and relevant sentencing decisions of this Court. But they are resoundingly silent on the question of the significance of a second serious offence committed after the first fraud had been discovered and when the respondent had been given, for whatever reason, the opportunity to reform himself without the loss of his good name or his profession. That was such a seriously aggravating feature of the second offence, that there had to be some mention of it and some discussion of how it impacted upon the assessment of the appropriate sentences and how they should be structured. 
      
       
     34 The Court should be slow to attribute error to a sentencing judge simply on the basis that the judge has failed to refer to a matter during the course of giving remarks on sentence. This is particularly so where the judge is as senior and experienced as the sentencing judge in the present matter. But there are occasions when the matter is of such importance to the exercise of the sentencing discretion that a failure to mention it at all is indicative of error, particularly where it is a matter that has been addressed by at least one of the parties. Further in this particular case the structure of the sentence is, as Mr Byrne has conceded, not in accord with the dictates of Pearce v The Queen, and current sentencing practice. 
      
       
     35 The failure to sentence in the way that Peace v The Queen requires, that is by fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and then determining whether to accumulate them in whole or in part to reflect the totality of the criminality, is no matter of technicality. Nor is it mere pedantry to criticise the exercise of a sentencing discretion which does not accord with the view expressed by members of the High Court and which has been applied on numerous occasions by this Court. In R v AEM (Snr) [2002] NSWCCA 58, it was described as a “fundamental principle”. However, I acknowledge that, if at the end of the day the overall sentence imposed were appropriate to reflect the totality of the criminality, there would be little reason for this Court to intervene simply to redress that error, particularly on a Crown appeal. But in the present case it confirms my view that his Honour’s approach to an assessment of the totality of the criminality before him was erroneous. 
      
       
     36 In my opinion the totality of the criminality in the offences before his Honour could not be reflected in the sentence for the first offence notwithstanding its seriousness. Yet that is what the structure of the sentences imposed by his Honour asserts when the sentence for the second offence was made wholly concurrent with that for the first. If his Honour inflated the sentence for the first offence in order to incorporate the criminality for the second, then that was clearly an erroneous way of proceeding. But in my opinion the sentence for the first offence is clearly not excessive given the seriousness of the criminality that it encompassed. 
      
       
     37 The second offence was itself a very significant criminal act, albeit involving only one act of criminality, which was committed in breach of trust. It was clearly planned at least in so far as the respondent gave instructions to have the cheque paid to him personally. In no way could it be considered to be part of the course of conduct involved in the first offence. The second act of offending showed the respondent’s manifestations of contrition in respect of the first offence to be as hollow as the façade he displayed as an honest, upstanding member of the church and local community. It disentitled him to any leniency in respect of that offence. 
      
       
     38 I am persuaded that the sentencing of the respondent miscarried when his Honour imposed a concurrent sentence for the second offence and that as a consequence the overall sentence imposed upon the respondent was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     39 What then should be this Court’s response? Taking into account double jeopardy, it seems to me that the adjustment which should now be made to the sentence to address his Honour’s error and the inadequacy of the punishment inflicted upon would be minimal in terms of the period which the respondent would be required to serve before being eligible for release to parole. But it seems that the consequence would be unduly harsh so far as the nature of the sentence to be served by the respondent is concerned. We have been informed that if the minimum period of imprisonment were increased, it would result in the prisoner being re-classified to maximum security. That fact would not be a relevant consideration in determining the sentence at first instance but it seems to me that it should be considered in determining whether now to intervene. This is particularly so where the increase to the non-parole period would be a relatively modest amount although no doubt a significant increase in punishment for the respondent. 
      
       
     40 I am prepared to give the respondent the benefit of the doubt that I feel about whether the sentence should be increased and would propose that the appeal be dismissed. This outcome should not be used to justify the result of any other sentencing discretion for like offences. Nor should the respondent and like persons who commit similar offences in positions of trust be regarded as other than criminals richly deserving of punishment in prison, whatever the nature of that imprisonment might be.

      R v Christopher Tien VAN TRAN 
       
      R v Hung VAN TRAN 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: These are applications for leave to appeal by Christopher Tran and Hung Van Tran against the sentences imposed upon them by his Honour Judge Shadbolt in the District Court at Sydney on 15 February 2002, following their pleas of guilty to a charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, which offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
      
       
     2 Each of the accused also asked that a further offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm be taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     3 His Honour sentenced each of the applicants to imprisonment for four years and fixed a non-parole period of three years. 
      
       
     4 The facts of the matter are that both of the applicants were shot as they drove along the Cumberland Highway on 3 February 2001. They believed that the perpetrator of this attack was a man named Khan Do, although he has always denied this. It was nevertheless the applicants’ firm belief that he was responsible, and they convinced their co-accused of the truth of this incident. 
      
       
     5 In order to avenge themselves, they decided to shoot at Do’s house and to this end they obtained his address, a gun, and men to perform the task. Eleven days later, armed with a number of firearms, namely, two 9 mm Luger pistols, three .A5 ACP calibre and a .22 calibre pistol, a group of men in two cars drove to Sussex Street, Cabramatta and parked on the road. 
      
       
     6 These men including the applicant Hung Van Tran, approached the house. Khan Do and a man called Thanh Van Phan were sitting on the front verandah. Both men were shot and the two cars and the assailants sped away. Twenty-seven cartridges were recovered from the scene, some as close as three metres from the front of the house. It was sheer good fortune that one or both of the persons on the verandah were not killed. 
      
       
     7 Khan Do was shot a number of times, once to the left buttock, which caused a femoral fracture, which required surgery, and one bullet glanced off his forehead. Thanh Van Phan was shot in both knees, and he too underwent surgery. 
      
       
     8 Police intercepted a number of phone calls prior to the commission of the crime, and from these there is no doubt that Christopher Tran and Hung Van Tran procured the others to do the shooting on their behalf. Needless to say, the matter taken into account on the Form 1 was the shooting of Thanh Van Phan.  
      
       
     9 The applicants, therefore, pleaded guilty to a very serious offence, which his Honour stated, correctly in my view, called for sentences towards the top of the range. As his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was a violent premeditated crime of revenge committed so long after the events which it is claimed gave rise to it as to be without mitigation. Those who use guns to settle disputes must expect to be imprisoned. Those who join others in this regard must expect to go to prison for a long time too.” 
         
        
       
     10 The same is, of course, also true of those, like the applicants, who instigate and procure the use of guns to exact revenge. This community abhors and detests the use of guns, particularly for the purpose of settling personal disputes, and their use in the community will not be tolerated. 
      
       
     11 It is also to be borne in mind that at the time of these offences, Christopher Tran was subject to a bond for an assault, and, although Hung Van Tran had not been before the criminal courts since 1996, he had, on that occasion, been convicted and sentenced on a charge of possessing a firearm. Moreover, each of the applicants asked the judge to take into account a similar offence on the schedule to the Form 1. 
      
       
     12 This Court, in particular, has recently reaffirmed that, when matters are taken into account in this way, an otherwise appropriate sentence for the foundation offence should not be only slightly increased when the offence to be taken into account is serious in its own right, and a judge sentencing for an offence to which he or she is asked to take into account an additional offence or offences, should give due recognition to the gravity of that offence or those offences: R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63, 121 A Crim R 185 at [35]; R v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 322, 125 A Crim R 27 at [23], R v Bavandra [2000] NSWCCA 292, 115 A Crim R 152 at [30-31], R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-2. 
      
       
     13 The facts of this case indicated that the assailants were not only out to harm Khan Do, but were prepared to do similar harm to anyone else who may have the misfortune to be in the vicinity at the time. 
      
       
     14 The principal submissions made on behalf of the applicants were: 
      
       
       (a) that his Honour did not, in his reasoning, state the prison sentence which he considered to be appropriate in this case, meaning thereby, as I understand it, a starting point from which adjustments were made for various relevant subjective features of each applicant; 
        
       (b) that his Honour concluded that the applicants had the possibility of redemption and rehabilitation, but did not indicate how that reflected itself in the sentences imposed; and  
        
       (c) that his Honour referred to the pleas of guilty, but did not indicate the extent to which these pleas reflected themselves in the sentences imposed. 
        
       
     15 Whilst it is true that his Honour did not specify a starting point and a specific discount for the pleas of guilty, and each other subjective feature which he considered relevant, it is obvious that he took into account, in particular, the pleas of guilty, because the sentences of four years could not, on any reasoning, be described as “towards the top of the range”, which his Honour correctly said was called for by these offences. 
      
       
     16 His Honour, in effect, adopted a single process, an intuitive approach, sometimes referred to as the “instinctive synthesis approach”, and did not specify particular discounts for particular elements. This was in accordance with the approach taken in cases such as R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 (except as to assistance to the authorities), R v Beavan (unreported - CCA - 22 August 1991), R v Lett (unreported - CCA - 27 March 1995). 
      
       
     17 However, in R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [160], whilst generally approving the instinctive synthesis approach, the Court laid down a number of guidelines in respect of pleas of guilty, including the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
          
          
         (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant – contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value – but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g., assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
          
          
         (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea …  
          
          
         (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount.” 
         
        
       
     18 However, the Chief Justice had earlier said, at [72]:- 
      
       
        
         
         “ ... a guideline which indicates that sentencing judges should, where appropriate, quantify a discount for a plea operates by way of encouragement and not by way of prescription.” 
         
        
       
     19 In the subsequent case of R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142, 54 NSWLR 300, where R v Thomson was affirmed, the Chief Justice also referred, with approval, to the South Australian case of R v Place [2002] SASC 101, where it was held, inter alia, that failure to identify a specific reduction (for a plea of guilty) is not an error of principle, nor is it, in itself, a ground for interference with the sentence. 
      
       
     20 In reference to the pleas of guilty his Honour said he would extend to each the maximum permitted for their co-operation in pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, and saving the expense to the State of a long trial, by which I take it he meant that he would afford them a discount of approximately 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of their pleas. 
      
       
     21 Having regard to the maximum penalty of seven years, the seriousness of the offences which his Honour described as calling for a sentence towards the top of the range, and taking into account the additional matter on the Form 1, a sentence of five and a half to six years could not be regarded as unreasonable or disproportionate. Allowing a discount for the pleas of guilty of 25 per cent, that would result in a head sentence of four years one and a half months to four years six months. In those circumstances, I could not regard the head sentence of four years as excessive. 
      
       
     22 Reference was also made to a number of other features to which it is appropriate that I make specific reference. His Honour noted that in his Remarks on Sentence that neither of the applicants is without the possibility of redemption and rehabilitation, and it was submitted that a specified allowance should have been made for this, and another specified allowance for the difficulties they had had in their younger years, and that his Honour should also have specified the amount by which the sentence had been increased on account of the additional matter on the Form 1. 
      
       
     23 However, except in respect of assistance to the authorities (R v Gallagher) and the objective utilitarian value of a plea of guilty (R v Thomson, R v Sharma) it is not necessary, and often undesirable, that additional or reduced periods be specified in respect of each element of the sentencing process, and the instinctive synthesis approach is still generally applicable. The reasons for this are set out in cases such as R v Lett and are just as valid today as when originally pronounced. 
      
       
     24 His Honour referred to these various matters. It can therefore be assumed he took them into account and it was not necessary to make any further detailed specification in respect of them. I might add it is one thing to say that a person standing for sentence is not without the possibility of redemption and rehabilitation, and it is something very different to say that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. 
      
       
     25 In order to succeed in an appeal against a sentence, an applicant must show that the sentence is outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion, and it is only in such a case that this Court is authorised to vary the sentences imposed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3), R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289. 
      
       
     26 In my view these sentences were not outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion. I would, therefore, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeals and confirm the sentences. 
      
       
     27 KIRBY J: I agree. 
      
       
     28 DUNFORD J: The orders will therefore be as I have indicated.

      NSW Crime Commission v Mahoney 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
    1 Sperling J: On 8 June 2000, a restraining order was made pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 in relation to the property of the applicant, Robert Bradley Mahoney. He was then living on a farm at Black Hill, New South Wales, which he owned jointly with his mother. 
     
      
    2 On 9 April 2001, an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s 22 was made by consent pursuant to s 22 in relation to the applicant’s interests in property. The property to which it related included the Black Hill property. A similar order was made in relation to the applicant’s mother. That included her interest in the property. 
     
      
    3 The forfeiture order relating to the applicant distinguished between the applicant’s interest in the Black Hill property and other property of the applicant. The terms of the order provided for the payment of $40,000 to the applicant’s then solicitors out of the Black Hill property. A stay against disposition of certain of the applicant’s property pending determination of any application for exemption pursuant to ss 25 or 26 did not include the Black Hill property. 
     
      
    4 Plainly, the forfeiture order contemplated the sale of the Black Hill property. That, however, was not, according to the applicant, his understanding of what was to be done or of what had been done in his name. He said on oath that he had instructed his lawyers at that time that he would not give up the Black Hill property. He said further, on oath, that he first became aware of a prospective sale of the Black Hill property on 8 August 2002 at Newcastle District Court when he heard a crown prosecutor say that the property was to be sold. 
     
      
    5 An auction sale of the Black Hill property was scheduled for Saturday 26 October 2002. 
     
      
    6 By notice of motion filed on 21 October 2002, the applicant sought orders setting aside the forfeiture order of 9 April 2001 and an order restraining the sale. The application for an injunction to restraint the sale was heard by me on 25 October 2002. 
     
      
    7 I need not review the events which account for the delay since August 2002 in making the present application. There was no serious dispute that the delay was satisfactorily explained. 
     
      
    8 The application for the injunction was initially put on the basis of preserving the status quo pending the determination of the application to set aside the forfeiture order. Later in argument, the application was put on the basis of preserving the status quo pending the determination of an application for an exclusion order, listed for hearing in February 2003. 
     
      
    9 On 25 October 2002, having heard evidence and argument, I reserved my decision. On 26 October 2002, I granted an injunction until further order. I said I would give my reasons a later time. 
     
      
    10 As will appear, a case was made out for the grant of an interim injunction pending the determination of the application for an exclusion order. Accordingly, it was unnecessary for me to decide whether a case would otherwise have been made out on the alternative basis. 
     
      
    11 The application for an exemption order relating to the whole of the applicant’s interest in the Black Hill property will turn on the prospect of the applicant establishing that he acquired his interest in that property without the use of what I will loosely call tainted funds. There is evidence available to the applicant that this is so. The Commission challenges that evidence. However, at the least, there is a serious prospect that the applicant’s evidence will be accepted. Accordingly, there is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the application to exempt the whole of the Black Hill property from the forfeiture order. 
     
      
    12 As to balance of convenience, I had to take into account that, where property is a person’s home, it has a special value. The property was the applicant’s home until he was prevented from living there by bail conditions imposed in about September 2000. 
     
      
    13 Opposing considerations were that if the sale was cancelled the expense of mounting the auction sale would be thrown away if the applicant failed in his application for an exclusion order. That may amount to $2000 to $3000 on what I was told. Another consequence was that the previous solicitor would be kept out of his money, but it seemed that something in the order of $1500 was in fact owing there, rather than the larger sum mentioned in the forfeiture order. 
     
      
    14 The applicant offered the usual undertaking as to damages, plus an undertaking in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        I further undertake to the Court that any property described in the Schedule to orders made on 9 April 2001 (and entered 18 April 2001) will be applied to fulfil my undertaking to the Court before it is paid, transferred or otherwise returned to me or paid or transferred to anyone on my direction. 
        
       
       
      I thought there is a serious prospect that, notwithstanding the undertakings offered, the expenditure thrown away by cancellation of the auction sale would not be recovered assuming an entitlement on the part of the Public Trustee to recover the cost. I took that into account. 
       
      
    15 Balancing out these considerations, it seemed to me that the interests of justice required that the injunction be granted. As a matter of convenience, I framed the injunction to run until further order of the Court but with the intent that it would preserve the status quo until determination of the application for an exemption order.

      REGINA v PAUL RAYMOND BAIRD 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellant appeals against his conviction for an offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), that, on or about 12 May 2000 at Wickham in the State of New South Wales, he did have sexual intercourse with Cherie Patricia Sloan without her consent knowing that she was not consenting, and at the time threatening to inflict actual bodily harm on her by means of an offensive weapon, namely, a knife. The offence carries a penalty of a term of imprisonment for twenty years. 
      
       
     2 The appellant had been indicted on four counts in total. In addition to the count which is the subject of this appeal, he was indicted on another count under s 61J involving an offence against one Lisa-Jane Ellen Barbour, and further on a count that he stole a sum of money and other items from Lisa-Jane Ellen Barbour, being an offence under s 94 of the Crimes Act. The fourth count involved a charge of stealing from Cherie Patricia Sloan under s 94 of the Crimes Act. 
      
       
     3 The charges were heard before Job QC ADCJ and a jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both s 61J counts and upon the s 94 count insofar as it related to Lisa-Jane Ellen Barbour. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the s 94 count insofar as it related to Cherie Patricia Sloan. 
      
       
     4 The appellant has appeared before this Court in person. He presented to the Court written submissions and in addition made oral submissions. There were also admitted into evidence during the course of the appeal five statutory declarations made by the appellant on 18 August 2002 and he was cross-examined on those statutory declarations. In reply to that evidence the Crown read an affidavit of Constable Chris Wiedemann sworn 28 October 2002 and Mr Baird cross-examined Constable Wiedemann. 
      
       
     5 The appellant advanced three bases upon which he submitted his conviction on the s 61J count insofar as it related to Ms Sloan should be quashed. The first basis was that because the jury disbelieved Ms Sloan on the stealing charge, she ought not to have been believed on the s 61J sexual assault charge. In other words, given the inconsistent verdicts insofar as they related to counts involving Ms Sloan, the s 61J conviction was unsafe. In our opinion, the appellant has not made good that challenge. Clearly the jury did not believe Ms Sloan or the other evidence called in support of her case insofar as she alleged that the appellant had stolen money and other items from her. However, the s 94 charge was of a very different nature to the sexual assault count under s 61J. In many ways it might be considered as an ancillary charge to the main s 61J charge in the sense that it was a charge in respect of alleged conduct which occurred after the s 61J count and, as we have said, it was of an entirely different nature. 
      
       
     6 As far as the s 61J count is concerned, the Crown case was based not only on the evidence of Ms Sloan but on other substantial objective evidence. That evidence included the evidence of the service station proprietor to whom Ms Sloan reported immediately after the incident who observed the scratching or cuts to the back of her neck and also to the evidence of Ms Stanton who gave evidence of having seen the complainant on the night of the offence in a dishevelled state.  
      
       
     7 Perhaps even more significant, however, is that there was evidence which supported Ms Sloan’s evidence that she had been tied up with tape during the course of the assault. That evidence included the fact she was seen to have a sticky substance on her wrists and she identified grey tape found in the appellant’s car. The evidence of being tied up with grey tape was part of the case presented by the Crown under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as tendency evidence, given that the complainant in the first s 61J count, Ms Barbour, also gave evidence of having been tied up with grey tape. There was no evidence that Ms Sloan knew about the assault or the manner of the assault on Ms Barbour at the time she made her complaint of the assault including having been tied up with the tape. 
      
       
     8 The law on inconsistent verdicts is now well traversed: see MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348, Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and Regina v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. It is not necessary for us to canvass that law in any detail.  
      
       
     9 I am of the opinion, having regard to the matters to which I have just referred, that the guilty verdict under the s 61J charge and the not guilty verdict on the s 94 charge, insofar as they relate to Ms Sloan, do not represent an affront to logic and commonsense and do not indicate there has been any compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. There is no basis, therefore, for this Court to interfere so as to prevent a possible injustice: see MacKenzie v The Queen at 365 per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ.  
      
       
     10 I might just add there were other significant distinguishing features between this case and a case such as Jones, but the real point of differentiation, in my view, is that different evidence, including different supporting evidence was given in respect of each count. 
      
       
     11 The second challenge which is made to the verdict might be summarised as saying that there was an unfairness in the presentation of the evidence in the case. The appellant suggests this unfairness was demonstrated in a number of respects, for example, the car in which the assault is alleged to have taken place was effectively made unavailable to him and his legal advisers so that he could not have any of his own forensic testing carried out on it. He indicates that the forensic testing that he might have wished to have carried out was in relation to possible blood stains in the car, given the complainant alleged that her tooth was broken in the course of the assault and that it cut through her lip. I understand the submission to be that it must follow, therefore, there would have been some blood of hers in the car. I do not see that this necessarily follows at all. In any event, I do not see it would have made any difference to the case. As I have indicated, in respect of the previous ground the objective evidence in the case was very strong and I do not see there has been any unfairness in the car being unavailable.  
      
       
     12 It was also pointed out in the written submissions that the unavailability of the car was only raised at a very late point, I think during the course of the second trial, by which stage it would have been of little value.  
      
       
     13 The appellant also relied upon some inconsistency of evidence in relation to the complainant’s allegation that her tooth was broken. The expert evidence, however, was that it was a filling in her tooth which was broken, not her tooth. I consider it to be of no relevance at all. The photographs taken of the complainant shortly after the assault show some breaking of a tooth, whether that be properly described as a broken tooth or a broken filling, I think it of no moment and therefore no unfairness followed. 
      
       
     14 There were other complaints made, for example, apparently a condom was lost for a significant period of time, in the order of something like six months, and DNA testing therefore could not be done on that until after that period of time.  
      
       
     15 An additional complaint is made that the appellant’s permission to conduct DNA testing on the condom was not obtained. Again, no unfairness flows from this. The appellant has given blood samples consensually which he knew were to be subjected to DNA testing. He does not contest the result of the DNA testing on the condom. There is no requirement at law that once appropriate DNA matching material is obtained consensually from a person that that person’s consent is then needed to conduct DNA testing on other evidence. 
      
       
     16 He also complains there was an inconsistency in evidence about whether an orange-handled knife was used or not. Again, in my opinion, that was a jury matter. There was very early evidence that the complainant exhibited marks which appeared to be cutting marks from a sharp instrument on her neck within less than an hour of the alleged assault. The jury were entitled to deal with her evidence as to whether it was an orange-handled knife and assess that evidence against the other evidence in determining whether or not the charge as laid was made out. 
      
       
     17 The third point made is that Ms Sloan, another Crown witness, Ms Stanton, a friend of Ms Sloan’s, and the police, particularly Constable Wiedemann, fabricated evidence in the case. The allegation of the fabricated evidence related to the stealing count under s 94. Essentially the point made was that the complainant was not believed in respect of her allegation that her jewellery and other items were stolen, therefore that evidence was fabricated.  
      
       
     18 It was then alleged that Constable Wiedemann who took Ms Sloan’s statement was involved thereby in the fabrication and that in some way made the verdict under the s 61J count unfair and therefore liable to be quashed. Merely to state the reasoning is, I believe, sufficient to demonstrate its illogicality. There is no denying that the jury did not believe Ms Sloan’s evidence in respect of the s 94 count but that does not in any way implicate Constable Wiedemann. He took statements. In his cross-examination he conceded that he made a mistake in his affidavit but even the appellant was prepared to concede during the course of his submissions that that mistake may have been no more than a confusion as to the dates.  
      
       
     19 Having read his evidence in the affidavit, having heard his evidence and having read the statements of Ms Sloan and Ms Stanton, which are exhibit A on the appeal, I are not satisfied there was any fabrication by Constable Wiedemann or any involvement in any fabrication of the evidence. 
      
       
     20 For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should fail and should be dismissed. 
      
       
     21 SPERLING J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
      
       
     22 CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     23 BEAZLEY JA: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

     1 LEVINE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
      
       
     2 HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, against sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court after he was found guilty at trial of two charges of dangerous driving occasioning death and two further charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The charges of dangerous driving occasioning death, brought under s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act, carry a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 10 years. The charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, brought under s 52A(3)(c), carry a maximum sentence of seven years. On the major charges the sentencing judge passed concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of twelve months. On the lesser charges his Honour passed concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for six months, those terms also being concurrent with the twelve month non-parole period. Effectively, then, the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     3 The charges arose from a tragic accident which occurred in Cowpastures Road, West Hoxton on the morning of 14 September 1999. Ms Patricia Lerch was driving her Holden Gemini sedan in Cowpastures Road, approaching the intersection with Nineteenth Avenue. Her three daughters, aged from two to eleven years, and her five year old son were passengers in the vehicle. There was a line of five cars stopped at the intersection, waiting to turn right into Nineteenth Avenue. Ms Lerch stopped behind them. Also approaching the intersection was a heavy truck, driven by the respondent. He failed to stop and collided with the rear of Ms Lerch’s car. 
      
       
     4 Two of Ms Lerch’s daughters, aged two and four, died as a result of the collision. Her eleven year old daughter and five year old son suffered serious injuries. The daughter lost consciousness and sustained a small laceration to her forehead, a compound fracture of her left occipital bone and mild traumatic brain injury. Although psychologically traumatised, she was reported to have made an excellent physical recovery. The son suffered fractures to the right tibia and fibula, resulting in a slight shortening of his right leg.  
      
       
     5 His Honour made a number of findings of fact for the purpose of sentence which were not challenged by either party to this appeal. The weather at the time was fine, the road was dry, and visibility was unobstructed. The respondent was a truck driver by profession. It was not the first time he had driven the truck involved in the collision and he was familiar with the route along Cowpastures Road. He did not apply his brakes before the collision. He was not driving at an excessive speed and, if he had been keeping a proper look out, he should have been able to stop in time. 
      
       
     6 The respondent told police, and his Honour appeared to have accepted, that he had little or no recollection of the collision or of what occurred immediately prior to it. However, two drivers travelling in the opposite direction gave evidence that the respondent took his eyes from the road, looking downwards and to his left, just before the impact. One of them, Mr McKenna, said that he glanced up for a couple of seconds and then appeared to look down again. This evidence led to his Honour’s crucial finding for the purpose of sentence, which he expressed in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         … clearly it is consistent with the verdicts, that the offender was not looking ahead, but was intent upon doing something else whatever that may have been. It is not for me to speculate as to what caused or motivated the offender not to look ahead, nor to speculate as to what he was doing. What is to the point is that the offender did not attend to his driving in the circumstances of that occasion. 
          
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Clearly, one cannot quantify accurately in terms of seconds or parts of seconds the dynamics of that which Mr McKenna observed. But accepting as I do Mr McKenna’s evidence, that having looked down, the offender glanced up and then looked down again, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that the offender made a deliberate decision and in looking down took a calculated risk. 
         
        
       
     7 His Honour noted that there was a volume of traffic in the area at the time, and that people were driving to work or taking their children to school. In the circumstances, he rejected a submission on behalf of the respondent that his manner of driving amounted to no more than momentary inattention. That expression, his Honour said, was inadequate to “describe the serious disregard by the offender of his obligation as a driver of that vehicle on that occasion”. 
      
       
        
       Subjective case 
        
       
     8 The respondent was thirty-four years old at the time of the offences, and is now thirty-six. He has no prior convictions. He has a minor traffic record, which his Honour treated as of no significance. He has been in a stable de facto relationship since 1998, which produced two children. His partner has three children from a previous relationship, who were living with them. He has a son from a previous relationship, who has been living with his mother. 
      
       
     9 The respondent attained the higher school certificate and had been in steady employment since. He had been a truck driver since 1993. After the accident, he did not drive any vehicle and handed in his licence.  
      
       
     10 For a time he went back to work as an offsider to a truck driver but that did not continue. He and his partner purchased a take-away food business, which they operated for about twelve months. However, the business failed because of vandalism and harassment, apparently as the result of publicity about the accident. They went into voluntary bankruptcy, and at the time of sentence they had accrued debts of about $197,000 and were facing the loss of their home.  
      
       
     11 His partner gave evidence, attesting to his remorse and to the severe emotional effects of the accident upon him. In a pre-sentence report, a Probation and Parole officer observed that he “displayed a high degree of unresolved trauma, which he attributed to the deaths and injuries to the victims and also to the alleged harassment and threats made to him and his family, which has led inadvertently to the loss of his business and home”.  
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
     12 In this Court, the Crown prosecutor argued that each of the four sentences is manifestly inadequate, and that the effective total sentence of two years with a non-parole period of twelve months fails to reflect the totality of the respondent’s criminality. In particular, he submitted that the sentences are disproportionate to the seriousness of the offences, fail to give adequate weight to the consideration of general deterrence and, as far as the charges of dangerous driving causing death are concerned, fail to recognise that the gravamen of that offence is not just the dangerous driving but also the taking of human life. Finally, he argued that his Honour fell into error in directing that all four sentences be served concurrently. 
      
       
     13 In R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343, this Court revisited its guideline judgment in respect of offences under s 52A of the Crimes Act in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. His Honour did not have the benefit of that recent decision at the time he passed sentence. In Whyte (at para 204) Spigelman CJ identified features of a typical case as follows: 
      
       
       (i) Young offender.(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions.(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person.(iv) The victim is a stranger.(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates.(vi) Genuine remorse.(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
       
     14 In Jurisic (at 231) the Chief Justice had set out a list of aggravating factors established by the authorities, and in Whyte (at paras 216-7) his Honour enunciated a revised list of those factors as follows: 
      
       
        
       (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
        
       (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
        
        
       (iii) Degree of speed. 
        
        
       (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
        
        
       (v) Erratic or aggressive driving. 
        
        
       (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
        
        
       (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
        
        
       (viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
        
        
       (ix) Escaping police pursuit. 
        
        
       (x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
        
        
       (xi) Failing to stop. 
        
       
     15 The Chief Justice went on, adopting what he had said in Jurisic, to observe that the first two of those factors focus on the occurrence, whereas the others relate to the conduct of the offender. The presence of those other factors might indicate that the offender had abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct, and would bear upon an assessment of the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence: Whyte at paras 218 and 228. His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         229 The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         231 In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s 52A, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment. 
          
         
        
       
     16 The Chief Justice emphasised (at para 232) that the guideline is a “guide” or a “check”, and that the appropriate sentence in each case must be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion. His Honour also observed that the guideline focuses on the objective circumstances of the offence, and that the offender’s subjective circumstances must also be considered. 
      
       
     17 The present case differs in several respects from the typical case identified in Whyte at para 204. The respondent is not a young man and did not plead guilty. Far from death or permanent injury to a single person, two children were killed and two others were seriously injured. Turning to the aggravating factors listed at paras 216-17, the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted were very serious and the respondent’s manner of driving was such as to put a significant number of people at risk. On the other hand, his conduct did not exhibit any of the other factors referred to. 
      
       
     18 Counsel for the respondent, Mr Dhanji, argued that the accident was the result of misjudgement and that the respondent’s conduct was at the lowest end of the scale in terms of moral culpability: cf Whyte, per Spigelman CJ at para 214. It is true that one could readily imagine a much more culpable course of driving. The respondent was not driving recklessly, at an excessive speed or under the influence of alcohol. Nevertheless, his inattention at the critical time cannot fairly be described as misjudgement. As I have said, the sentencing judge did not see the accident as the product of momentary inattention. His Honour’s unchallenged findings, set out in paras 5 and 6 of these reasons, were that the respondent took a calculated risk in taking his eyes from the road and that, given the volume of traffic and conditions at the time, he was in serious disregard of his obligation as the driver of a heavy vehicle. That is the measure of his blameworthiness, and nothing would be gained by an attempt to assign to his conduct some position within a notional scale of culpability. 
      
       
     19 Mr Dhanji relied upon three decisions of this Court in cases involving driving which amounted to more than momentary inattention, but all of them are distinguishable from the present case and are of little assistance in resolving this appeal. In R v Mansour [1999] NSWCCA 180, a sentence of four years for one charge of dangerous driving occasioning death was reduced to two years, comprising a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of twelve months. In R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215, a Crown appeal against a suspended two year sentence for one charge of dangerous driving occasioning death was dismissed. Apart from other distinguishing features, each of those cases involved the death of one person only.  
      
       
     20 Of more significance is R v Oddie [2001] NSWCCA 524, in which an effective sentence of two years with a non-parole period of twelve months for one count of dangerous driving occasioning death and two counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm was reduced to sixteen months with a non-parole period of eight months. However, the Court intervened in that case because the sentencing judge had made no clear finding about the culpability of the offender’s driving apart from accepting a Crown submission that it was more than misjudgement. 
      
       
     21 Of course, appropriate weight must be given to the respondent’s subjective case. It is true, as Mr Dhanji pointed out, that he suffered a significant measure of extra curial punishment as a result of the vandalism and harassment to which I have referred, leading to the collapse of his business and his financial ruin, and that that is a matter properly to be taken into account: cf R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 at 566. Similarly, regard should be had to the severe and continuing psychological effect upon him of the accident: R v Dhanhoa [2000] NSWCCA 257, per Priestley JA at paras 12, 24, 34 and 40-44. 
      
       
     22 However, while giving full weight to those matters, I am satisfied that the effective sentence passed upon the respondent is manifestly inadequate and that this Court must intervene. I am not dissuaded from that conclusion by some additional evidence which we received going to our residual discretion to dismiss the appeal, although that material must be taken into account on re-sentence.  
      
       
     23 The primary reason why I would increase the sentence is that it fails to reflect the seriousness of the offences, given the particularly tragic consequences of the accident. As Hunt CJ at CL observed in R v Musumeci (CCA, unreported, 30 October, 1997) the “real substance” of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death is “not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life” (at p 5). Similarly, the extent of physical injury is relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of an offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     24 It is this which is reflected in the first of the aggravating factors set out at para 216 of Whyte, that is, the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, while para 231 recognises that the number of victims must bear upon the appropriate sentence. The sentence of two years in the present case is not adequate to denounce a course of driving which took the lives of two young people and seriously injured two others. Nor does it serve the requirement of general deterrence, so as to emphasise the special need for vigilance on the part of the drivers of heavy vehicles. 
      
       
     25 None of this is to deny that sentencing for offences of this kind is notoriously difficult. So much was recognised by Hunt CJ at CL in Musumeci. His Honour observed (at p 8) that “… sentencing in this type of case presents a particularly difficult task. They almost always are sad cases for everyone involved.” The devastating effect of this tragedy upon Ms Lerch and all the loved ones of those unfortunate children hardly needs to be stated. For their part, the lives of the respondent and his wife will never be the same again. 
      
       
     26 What, then, is to be done? The fresh material before this Court comprises a recent psychological report, and certificates from the Department of Corrective Services attesting to the respondent’s good behaviour and industriousness whilst in custody. The psychological report affirms the evidence which was before his Honour of the emotional effect of the accident upon the respondent. It also discloses that the children’s education has been disrupted through their being taunted at school about the incident. The psychologist saw the respondent on 6 September 2002, and noted what she considered to be “remnants of what was probably a severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder” resulting from the accident. She observed him to be “profoundly remorseful” and to have “demonstrated empathy for the parents of the victims based on a personal understanding of parental love and attachment.” She found him also to be suffering for his own family who were “sharing his trauma in different ways …”. 
      
       
     27 The psychologist noted that the respondent had not had adequate counselling whilst in prison, due to the fact that the resources of the psychology staff were “always stretched.” She concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Anthony’s personal qualities and his understanding of the joys and responsibilities of parenthood make his private grief over the offences very poignant indeed. He is unlikely to ever completely leave this tragic incident in the past, an experience he knows he shares with the parents of the victims.”  
          
         
        
       
     28 The respondent was sentenced on 11 April 2002, some six months ago. The principle of double jeopardy in Crown appeals means that he should not now have to face a sentence of the severity which might then have been passed upon him. The sentence which this Court passes should be the least which could properly have been imposed upon him at first instance: Jurisic at 232. In my view, that would be an effective sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years. I would achieve this by increasing the sentences on each of the first two counts accordingly. I do not consider that accumulation is called for. Clearly, there are special circumstances and the Crown prosecutor did not suggest otherwise.  
      
       
     29 I would allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence on the first two counts and on each count I would substitute a sentence of four years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years, to date from 11 April 2002. I would confirm the sentences of six months on the third and fourth counts, also commencing on 11 April 2002.

      R v Edward George THURSTON 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Stanley Joseph Lamb and Edward George Thurston have been found guilty of the murder of Terrence Patrick Byrne who was savagely kicked and stomped to death in a park in Tamworth on 29 October 2000 between about 7.45 and 8.45 in the evening. 
     
      
    2 The prisoners are stepbrothers who grew up together on the mission station at Collarenebri. Stanley Lamb had been living in Tamworth for some months and Edward Thurston, having left his de-facto wife in Dalby following domestic disagreements, was on his way to Sydney when he stopped over in Tamworth on the weekend of 28 and 29 of October and went to visit Lamb’s older brother, Frank Murray, at his home at 12 Kenny Drive in Coledale, a suburb in Tamworth. 
     
      
    3 On Sunday 29 October both Stanley Lamb and Edward Thurston spent most of the day drinking Moselle cask wine with a number of other Aboriginal young people in the Coledale area. Evidence was given by a number of witnesses concerning this drinking and it is apparent that Stanley Lamb in particular was significantly affected by the amount of alcohol he had drunk. During the afternoon they also, in the company of others, each smoked a couple of cones of marijuana in a bong.  
     
      
    4 Stanley Lamb had a verbal argument with Bradley French during the afternoon, and later he had a more intense argument with Anthony Slater because of which he removed his shirt and wanted to fight Anthony Slater. On both of these occasions Edward Thurston acted as a restraining influence and told him to calm down, and in the case of Anthony Slater he actually physically restrained him.  
     
      
    5 After the argument with Anthony Slater it appears that the prisoners walked towards Granny Munroe Park and shortly afterwards they were seen on the grassed area of the car park of the Coledale Community Centre where Stanley Lamb again became abusive towards Michael Marshall who was passing by, calling him “a white motherfucking cunt”. The prisoners then walked through the car park onto the pathway that leads across Granny Munroe Park to Matheson Street. 
     
      
    6 Meanwhile at the Locomotive Hotel the deceased purchased a cask of Moselle wine and a packet of Drum tobacco. He did not have sufficient cash on him to purchase the wine and to pay for a taxi to his home in Fleming Drive which was on the far side of Granny Munroe Park, but the publican gave him five dollars and called him a taxi. The deceased asked the taxi driver to take him as far as his money would take him towards his home, and he was taken to the corner of Kenny Drive and Warral Road which was at the corner of Granny Munroe Park, where he was dropped off at about 7.45pm. 
     
      
    7 At 10.22pm a “000” call was made, apparently by Stanley Lamb, from 12 Kenny Drive, the home of Frank Murray, requesting that an ambulance be sent to Granny Munroe Park because there was a man dead in the park. The caller said he was calling from Sydney but the operator was able to identify the source of the call as 12 Kenny Drive, Tamworth and notified the ambulance and police accordingly.  
     
      
    8 When police went to 12 Kenny Drive they found Edward Thurston asleep on the lounge, his top inside out, with blood on his jeans, his top and his shoes. He was arrested and taken to Tamworth Police Station for questioning, where he said in effect that he came across the deceased lying on a path in the park between 6 and 7pm, went to assist him and in doing so picked up the deceased’s head and checked for breathing and a pulse, he then panicked when he realised the deceased was dead and dropped his head, went home and went to sleep. He was scared because he thought he might get the blame for it. He also told a number of other lies in the interview and denied being involved in any way with the death of the deceased, and denied being present at the time of his death.  
     
      
    9 Meanwhile police went to 144 Duri Road where they found and arrested Stanley Lamb. He had in the meantime changed his clothes, and the clothes he was wearing that evening were not located until the following day. He was taken by police to Tamworth Police Station and when interviewed said that he was with Thurston in the park where they and the deceased were drinking together. After they consumed some wine they asked the deceased for money, but the deceased walked away and as he was walking away he called Lamb and Thurston “black cunts”.  
     
      
    10 He said that he then punched the deceased to the head knocking him to the ground, whereupon Edward Thurston went crazy and started kicking him. He said that Thurston would have kicked him about 100 times, that whilst doing so was saying, “kill him, kill him”, and that he required Lamb to help him by also kicking the victim, and he head butted Lamb to this end. Lamb said he would have kicked the deceased 15 times, three times in the head, including stomping on his head. This was not evidence against Thurston. He later went with police to the scene and took part in a video walkthrough with them.  
     
      
    11 On 31 October the accused Thurston was visited by his then de-facto wife, Kellie Burleigh, in the cells. He told her that he was present, but that Lamb had killed the deceased and that the motive was robbery, although it was not clear from the evidence, whether he said “it was a roll that went wrong” or “he [meaning Lamb] wanted to roll him and it went wrong”. She urged him to tell the truth to the police and he told the police that he wished to make another statement because he had told lies to protect “his brother”, meaning Lamb. The police arranged for him to see a solicitor before making any further statement, and apparently the solicitor advised him not to say anything further. This, of course, was not evidence against Lamb. 
     
      
    12 The injuries inflicted on the victim were horrific. The autopsy revealed the presence of multiple blunt force injuries to the head, neck and trunk including extensive bruising to the face and scalp, fractures of the facial bones and skull, and injury to the underlying brain. The injuries to the neck included fractures of the larynx. Ill-defined areas of bruising and numerous abrasions were also present on the upper limbs and trunk, there were numerous fractured ribs on both sides of the chest and bruising of the lungs. There was injury to the heart and to a number of structures around the heart. There was also a small amount of bleeding around the left adrenal gland. The pathologist, Dr Sugo, identified 27 separate lacerations or areas of bruising to the head and neck, fractures of all ribs on both sides, except the first, and the ribcage was in effect crushed. All injuries sustained were consistent with kicking and stomping on the deceased while he lay on his back, on the ground, and it can only be described as a frenzied and vicious assault by two young men on a defenceless man considerably older than themselves.  
     
      
    13 Stanley Lamb did not give evidence at the trial but Edward Thurston did. He said in effect that in the evening after the afternoon’s activities they were sitting in the park in the children’s playground area when they saw the deceased walking past with a cask of wine in a plastic bag. They asked him for a drink and he gave them each a drink, and then when they asked for another he said that this would be the last as he wanted to keep the rest for the following day.  
     
      
    14 The deceased then started to move off but Lamb said he was going to “roll him”, meaning rob him but Thurston did not respond, he was dozing for a period, and then he got up and followed them down the path where he saw Lamb kicking and stomping on the deceased. He said he pushed Lamb away and wiped blood from the deceased’s face, thus explaining the transferred blood found on the sleeves and an area of the top he was wearing at the time; however subsequently Lamb returned to the deceased and continued the assault until he pulled him away again.  
     
      
    15 Thurston defended the case on the basis that he was not involved in the assault although present during part of it, whilst Lamb claimed that Thurston was the major aggressor and that on account of his intoxication he did not form the relevant intent, and alternatively that he was provoked by the deceased calling him a “black cunt”. By their verdicts, the jury have rejected these various defences and for very good reason.  
     
      
    16 Although Thurston in his sworn evidence denied being involved and sought to explain the blood on his clothing by reference to his efforts to pull Lamb away from the deceased and his wiping the deceased’s face and head with his shirt, the marks of projected blood in particular, as well as transferred blood on his jeans and shoes, indicated his involvement; and this was reinforced by the evidence of the linear bruise on the deceased’s left forehead matching the pattern on the heel of one of the shoes worn by the prisoner.  
     
      
    17 As regards Lamb, the evidence established that he was a regular drinker to excessive amounts, and apparently had a high tolerance to alcohol. Although aggressive earlier in the evening, his actions were deliberate and showed an ability to reasonably form an intention to do various things after the killing, including to make the 000 call but claim he was making it from Sydney, to leave 12 Kenny Drive and walk across to 144 Duri Road on the other side of the railway line and then change his clothes and hide them, not in his own room, but in Betty Dennison’s room, before the police arrived.  
     
      
    18 The jury also rejected his defence of provocation, and the evidence was that the deceased was a mild-mannered, polite and courteous person who got on well with the local Aboriginal community, a number of whom lived in the same area as he did, so that it seems most unlikely that he made the remarks attributed to him, and in any event it is difficult to see how such remarks could have caused Stanley Lamb to lose his self control when he had been making similar remarks at white persons earlier in the evening.  
     
      
    19 Like the jury, I do not accept the versions put forward by either of the prisoners, that is by Lamb in his recorded interview with police (which is only evidence against him) or by Thurston in his evidence in the trial, although I am satisfied they each contain some elements of truth. I am satisfied that after they met up with the deceased in Granny Munroe Park and had a drink of his Moselle, they asked for another drink which the deceased gave them, but indicated it would be the last as he wished to keep it for the following day.  
     
      
    20 He then went to leave and as he did so either Lamb or both of them decided to rob him of his wine and any cash he had on him, and for this purpose Lamb punched him to the head, knocking him to the ground whereupon, no doubt inflamed by the alcohol they had drunk, they both lost their self control and kicked and stomped on him until he was dead. 
     
      
    21 Having regard to the fact that Lamb had been behaving aggressively to other persons earlier in the evening whilst Thurston had been trying to restrain him, and on his own admission Lamb had started the assault by punching the deceased and knocking him to the ground, I am satisfied that he was, initially at any rate, the principal aggressor; but I am also satisfied that Thurston subsequently played an equally aggressive part. I therefore regard the objective culpability of Lamb as somewhat greater than that of Thurston. 
     
      
    22 The deceased apparently had a high blood alcohol reading at the time of his death and apparently was a chronic alcoholic but I am satisfied that this in no way contributed to his death. He had no money of significance on him and the only proceeds of the robbery were a nearly full cask of cheap Moselle wine and a packet of Drum tobacco. 
     
      
    23 Stanley Lamb was born on 19 November 1977 and is now almost 25. He is the youngest of nine siblings and step-siblings and grew up on the Aboriginal Reserve at Collarenebri. His parents separated when he was approximately four years old and he remained with his mother but maintained a strong and positive relationship with his father, who died from lung cancer when the prisoner was aged 17. He left school at the age of 12, without completing his final year of primary education and he is for practical purposes unable to read or write.  
     
      
    24 He left home at the age of 14 or 15 after an argument with his mother and lived on the streets for some time. He subsequently moved to Tamworth and formed a relationship with a young lady which resulted in the birth of a daughter in 1997. The Pre-Sentence Report suggests that this remains a mutually supportive partnership despite periods of separation and violence on the part of the prisoner, but there was evidence at the trial that at the time of the offence the mother was not permitting the prisoner to see their daughter, and this was the cause of the argument he had with Anthony Slater during the course of the afternoon. He has had occasional jobs in shearing sheds and cotton picking but no regular employment. 
     
      
    25 He has an extensive history of drug and alcohol abuse, having started the use of cannabis at the age of nine with petrol sniffing at 13, progressing to alcohol and amphetamines at the age of 14 and subsequently heroin and cocaine. He has a large number of convictions dating back to 1992, including 13 for assault of various kinds and all of his offences have been associated with excessive use of alcohol.  
     
      
    26 What I find particularly disturbing is that some of the offences bear unfortunate similarities to the present. On 12 April 1995 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the circumstances being that having asked the victim for alcohol and being refused, he became aggressive, was told to leave the house, which he did, but he later returned and kicked the victim to the head as the latter was lying on the ground watching television.  
     
      
    27 Subsequently he was convicted on 10 May 1999 of assaulting his then de-facto partner by punching her a number of times to the head, and when she doubled over as a result, he kicked her to the head and stood on her head a number of times resulting in extensive bruising to her ribs, cheek, eye and jaw area.  
     
      
    28 He has served a number of short sentences of imprisonment and in addition has been granted parole, community service and supervised recognisances, none of which he has complied with. 
     
      
    29 According to the Pre-Sentence Report, he tends to be aggressive, and in particular has an inability to control his behaviour when intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol. The prisoner has acknowledged this, and during previous custodial sentences has attended drug and alcohol counselling and attracted positive reports in relation thereto, but despite extensive attempts to assist him via referral to a variety of agencies and facilities, he has on his release failed to avail himself of these opportunities and immediately returned to past patterns of behaviour, even when attendance at further counselling or a residential rehabilitation centre has been made a condition of his parole. There has been a similar lack of positive response when such conditions have been imposed as terms of bonds. 
     
      
    30 Anita Duffy, psychologist, assessed him as being of below average intelligence with low self-esteem bound up with his literacy problems. Personality testing revealed depressive, dependent and avoidant traits with high levels of anxiety, and his results were also significant on the paranoid and schizatypal scales suggesting he was suspicious and constantly vigilant to criticism and suspicious of others. Since being in custody he has undertaken courses in literacy, oral communication and Koori cultural values. He also suffers a heart condition which may require surgery in the future and has been referred to a cardiologist. 
     
      
    31 He is also said to be currently on protection in the prison system, but his counsel was not able to inform me of the reason for him being on protection, or precisely what restrictions were placed upon him as a result of such protection. Ms Duffy described him as being on strict protection and constantly vigilant to threat or harm from other inmates. In those circumstances it cannot be assumed that he will remain on protection for the whole of the sentence he is required to serve and the number of certificates and other records that have been produced concerning the education that he has undertaken indicate that he has not been deprived of educational facilities as a result of being on protection. I have nevertheless taken into account that protection entails a more severe form of punishment. 
     
      
    32 He has expressed remorse for his actions and claims that is why he telephoned the ‘000’ number, although the deceased was dead by the time the call was made. 
     
      
    33 Edward Thurston was born on 8 May 1975 and is now aged 27 years, the youngest of seven children. His parents separated when he was two years old and, after a time in welfare homes in the Grafton area he returned with his siblings to live with his mother in Coonamble. She moved to Collarenebri when he was about five years old and she married the father of Stanley Lamb. He then grew up in Collarenebri where they lived in tin humpies on the Aboriginal Reserve until they got a government built house, but in 1987 their mother died, whereupon the family split up and moved away. His biological father died in 1989 and he remained with his stepfather until he was 16 years old when he left the family home and he has been in trouble since shortly after that time.  
     
      
    34 He lived in Sydney for a while but in about 1998 he moved to Dalby where he formed a de-facto relationship with Ms Davidson with whom he had a child, born on 2 February 1999, but later that year this relationship broke down, mainly due to his drinking and verbal abuse of his partner. He then formed a relationship with Kellie Burleigh but this also came to an end a couple of days before he arrived in Tamworth, due once again to his drinking and physical violence towards her. He left school at about the age of 12 at the Year 6 level and is barely able to read and write. After leaving school he went to work cottonchipping and shearing with his stepfather.  
     
      
    35 He admits to extensive drug and alcohol use since the age of about 11. He apparently first smoked cannabis at about the age of seven and was a regular drug abuser from the age of 16. He also sniffed petrol when younger. He told Dr Nielson that he drinks all the time and has experienced several severe withdrawal deliriums. He has been using amphetamines since about the age of 16 and has also used heroin on a regular basis. He commenced using cocaine about six years ago. Whilst in custody he has commenced on the methadone program and is currently receiving 40mls daily.  
     
      
    36 He has a criminal record extending back to 1993 when he and other youths attacked some businessmen at Lavender Bay Wharf and robbed them of their wallets. The victims were assaulted with a piece of timber and kicked to the head and body and Thurston admitted to assaulting the victims and kicking one of them to the head about twice. He has other convictions for robbery whilst armed (with a pair of scissors), assault police, resist arrest, behave in a disorderly manner, possess prohibited drug and breach of a domestic violence order.  
     
      
    37 Since his arrest on this matter he has been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm arising out of an incident in prison where he assaulted the victim by punching him about 10 times to the head, provoked, he claimed, by derogatory remarks made towards him by the victim. For this he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months from 16 July 2001 to 15 January 2002.  
     
      
    38 Notwithstanding his previous convictions, when released on parole no steps appear to have been taken to curb his alcohol and other drug abuse. Whilst in prison on remand for this offence he was seen by the Drug and Alcohol Service, but by the time programs were made available to him, he declined to be involved, and he has never attended any formal drug rehabilitation.  
     
      
    39 Julie Hendy, neuropsychologist, concluded that he probably fell at the low end of the normal range of intelligence and that his reading and writing skills were consistent with those expected from a child aged about seven and a half years. She was of the view that his anxiety and stress levels are in the mild to moderate range and his depression level in the extremely severe stage, although these assessments appear to have been made in January 2002, that is before his trial (see date at top of each page of her report, except the first page).  
     
      
    40 He also has been in protection, apparently because of the risk of self-harm, and whilst in custody he has been undertaking courses in oral communication. He told the person who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report that he “feels bad” about the offence. 
     
      
    41 Both prisoners come from a deprived Aboriginal background which is unfortunately common, particularly in the western areas of this State where deprived living conditions, low self esteem and lack of education, lack of opportunity or motivation to obtain employment, coupled with alcohol and multiple drug abuse from an early age lead to lives with little hope or prospect, increased use of alcohol and drugs and the commission of crimes of violence. 
     
      
    42 The principles for sentencing such persons were discussed by Wood J in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62-63, and more recently in R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73, 119 A Crim R 535 at [29]-[33], and R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [66]-[68]. 
     
      
    43 Aboriginal persons who commit crimes of violence are not to be accorded special treatment by the imposition of lighter sentences but, although drug or alcohol abuse is not normally a mitigating factor, it can be taken into account when, as here, it reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the prisoners have grown up and their lack of opportunity for self improvement. But at the same time, it must not be overlooked that the objective gravity of the offence is very serious and a human life has been unlawfully and unjustifiably taken in what must have been a slow, painful and undignified agony for the victim. 
     
      
    44 Accordingly the sentences imposed must be substantial, but having regard to my findings on the facts, that in respect of Edward Thurston will be slightly less than that in respect of Stanley Lamb. They have both been in custody since 30 October 2000 and Lamb’s sentence will be backdated to commence on that date. In respect of Thurston it is necessary to have regard to the six-month sentence that has been served by him on account of the subsequent assault and his sentence will accordingly be backdated to 30 January 2001 to take account of that other sentence and make it partially, but not wholly, concurrent.  
     
      
    45 As regards the non-parole periods, no submissions were made to the effect that I should find special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but although there are a number of factors which could in combination amount to special circumstances, having regard to the gravity of the offence and what I regard as the minimum time each should serve in full time custody, I am satisfied that no adjustment should be made to the proportion fixed by the section. 
     
      
       
       
      
    46 Stanley Joseph Lamb, for the murder of Terrence Patrick Byrne I sentence you to imprisonment for 18 years, the sentence to date from 30 October 2000. I fix a non-parole period of 13½ years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 29 April 2014. 
     
      
    47 Edward George Thurston, for the murder of Terrence Patrick Byrne I sentence you to imprisonment for 17 years, the sentence to date from 30 January 2001. I fix a non-parole period of 12 years and 9 months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 29 October 2013.

       INTRODUCTION 
        
       
     3 Michele Mazzitelli (the appellant) was convicted on 17 October 2001 on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited import, namely, cocaine, contrary to the provisions of s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The gross quantity involved was 28.174 kilograms which yielded 17.4927 kilograms of pure cocaine. A commercial quantity of cocaine is 2 kilograms. The estimated street value of the cocaine imported was $7 million. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life or a fine not exceeding $750,000, or both (s 235(2)(c)). 
      
       
     4 On 20 November 2001 Judge McGuire of the District Court (the Trial Judge) sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 19 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 12 years and 4 months. The sentence was fixed to commence on 12 May 2000, the date on which the appellant was taken into custody, and to expire on 11 January 2020. The non-parole period was fixed to expire on 11 September 2012. 
      
       
     5 The appellant appealed against his conviction on the grounds that the Trial Judge: 
      
       
        
       (i) allowed evidence of the circumstances surrounding the arrest of co-accused which included listening device material of events at which the appellant was not present or a party to; 
        
        
       (ii) allowed evidence of the facts of the arrest of co-accused which included the discovery by co-accused persons of the drugs the subject of the indictment; 
        
        
       (iii) allowed evidence of contacts made by the appellant with a third party who was not charged but who engaged in contact with co-accused persons; 
        
        
       (iv) allowed evidence of telephone intercept material which was not relevant to the proceedings; 
        
        
       (v) allowed evidence of the facts and circumstances concerning the transfer of drugs from the auto electrians to the final destination at Liverpool including evidence of conversations between co-accused persons and Anastasiou, none of which were probative of the guilt of the appellant but were prejudicial; 
        
        
       (vi) erred in refusing to redirect the jury on the question of how circumstantial evidence was to be applied; 
        
        
       (vii) erred by failing to properly direct the jury on the question of circumstantial evidence; 
        
        
       (viii) failed to sum up fairly for the accused. 
        
       
     6 At the hearing counsel for the appellant informed the court that ground of appeal numbered (i) was not pressed. The other grounds were dealt with under the headings: 
      
       
     · Circumstantial evidence direction  
      
       
     · Lowering of standard of proof 
      
       
     · Unfairness of summing up. 
      
       
        
       Leave was also sought to add a further ground of appeal namely, that the Trial Judge “should have given an unreliability warning in relation to the evidence of Christakis Anastasiou”. Leave to add this ground was given. In addition, leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence was sought and argument was advanced to the effect that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
        
       BACKGROUND 
        
       
     7 Christakis Anastasiou (Anastasiou) was an auto electrician. He owned an auto-electrician’s business known as CMP Electrical. It operated from premises at Waterloo Road, Greenacre. Anastasiou was the brother-in-law of the appellant. They had known one another for some 16 years and the relationship between them was said to be good. 
      
       
     8 The evidence reveals that at about late 1999 or early 2000 the appellant approached Anastasiou with the request that he help him bring into Australia a steam cleaning machine for cleaning parts, buckets and metal objects generally. It was said that in order to import the machine in question it was necessary that there be an established company to whom the machine could be consigned. In order to assist, Anastasiou gave the appellant one of his business cards and one of his business letterheads which he stamped with his company’s seal. 
      
       
     9 About three months after this had taken place the appellant is said to have approached Anastasiou and to have asked him if he had received any papers in respect of the machine. No papers had arrived at that time but approximately a month after this approach had been made papers relating to the machine, including an invoice for an amount of about $6,400 arrived at Anastasiou’s business premises. They were followed a short time later by an operations manual and instruction book. These arrived about two weeks before the machine was delivered. After these documents, manual and book had arrived Anastasiou informed the appellant and he came to the workshop and took possession of the material. Anastasiou was told by the appellant that he would bring people to look at the machine and later that he was organising an electrician to make some adjustments to the wiring of the machine. The appellant asked Anastasiou to advise him when the machine arrived, but told him he was not to touch or open it. 
      
       
     10 The machine arrived in Sydney, apparently from Panama, and Anastasiou was contacted by a representative of a customs agent, Panalpina Word Transport at Alexandria (Panalpina), informed of the arrival of the machine and advised as to the amount to be paid in order to have it cleared. Anastasiou informed the appellant of what had occurred and after some discussion, and at the request of the appellant, arranged with another firm of customs and freight brokers, JJ Lawson of Mascot, to have the machine cleared. Anastasiou contacted a representative of that firm and arranged to send the papers concerning the machine to him. In the course of his dealings with JJ Lawson Anastasiou informed the representative of that firm that he was importing the machine in question for his brother-in-law, that the machine would be used to clean parts and that he was effecting the importation because his brother-in-law could not import the machine as a person, rather than as a business. Anastasiou was informed that this was not correct. 
      
       
     11 Anastasiou went to the appellant’s home where the appellant gave him an envelope. The envelope contained an amount of $6,120 in cash and had written on it the words and figures “$6,120 machine”. Anastasiou, having taken $530 for himself, gave the residue of $5,590 to Mr Terry Morris for payment to JJ Lawson and was advised that the goods had been customs cleared. 
      
       
     12 Evidence of a number of telephone conversations between Anastasiou and the appellant was tendered at the trial. These telephone conversations had been lawfully intercepted pursuant to warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The thrust of them was concerned with the handling and delivery of the cleaning machine. 
      
       
     13 The machine in question had been received in Sydney on 25 April 2000 from Panama. The evidence indicated that the machine in question was an old autoclave, that it was not able to be operated and was of little commercial value. Its purpose was for sterilising implements so as to destroy completely all known micro-organisms and viruses. It did not clean implements and was not suitable for cleaning vehicle or other parts. The evidence also revealed that the consignor as named in the documentation was non-existent. 
      
       
     14 The machine was opened, searched and tested by the authorities. Cocaine was found concealed in it. Part of the cocaine was removed from the machine, but an amount sufficient for relevant purposes was left in it and a controlled delivery was arranged after the machine has been reassembled and put back into its crate. The controlled delivery was made to Anastasiou’s business premises at Greenacre on 10 May 2000. 
      
       
     15 The appellant gave evidence at the trial in the course of which it emerged that he had driven to the Greenacre premises on a working day, had inspected the crate but had not opened it. Anastasiou was informed by the appellant that someone would come the next day to collect the machine. The next day a person identified as Marouf El Hassan came to Anastasiou’s premises at Greenacre accompanied by a truck and driver. El Hassan painted out certain marks on the crate containing the machine, loaded the crate onto the truck and took it away.  
      
       
     16 The vehicle onto which the crate was loaded was driven by Mr Jim Katsanevakis, an employee of Stephen Morris. The crate was taken to the premises of Troy Chatman at Lewis Road, Liverpool. Chatman opened the machine and removed the contents. For his part in the delivery and removal Chatman was paid $5,000. Radwin El Hassan and Ali Chami went to the premises at Lewis Road, Liverpool and inspected the powder. They realised it was not cocaine however, shortly thereafter the two El Hassans and Chatman were arrested. 
      
       
     17 The evidence tendered at the trial included phone calls by the appellant and Marouf El Hassan to Stephen Morris, the owner of the truck that had delivered the machine from Anastasiou’s premises at Greenacre to Chatman’s premises at Lewis Road, Liverpool. However, there was no evidence of meetings between the appellant or Anastasiou with either of the El Hassans, Chami or Chatman. 
      
       
     18 In the course of his evidence the appellant claimed never to have heard of the El Hassans or Chami or Chatman. He further deposed to the fact that he had never imported anything into Australia, denied any approach in that regard to Anastasiou and further denied that he had had any conversations with Anastasiou about the machine, its arrival in Australia or about its delivery and collection as deposed to by Anastasiou. His evidence was in effect a general denial of any involvement in the importation, delivery or re-delivery of the machine. However, he claimed to have had a conversation with Anastasiou and a man named Carlos about the machine and with Anastasiou about a customs broker. He admitted to having paid $2,000 towards the customs fee, but denied having provided the full amount of $6,120 but did admit to having written “$6120” on the envelope together with the words “cleaning machine” and to trying to arrange an electrician to do something to the machine. 
      
       
     19 In his evidence the appellant accepted that he had in fact taken the paper work concerning the machine to the customs agent, JJ Lawson, but said that he had done so at Anastasiou’s request. He admitted that he had seen the crate at Anastasiou’s premises after he had driven from Ryde to Greenacre for this purpose. He further admitted that he was going to arrange for an electrician to make electrical modifications to the machine but said that this was also to be on behalf of Anastasiou. However, he said that he had met the person by the name of Carlos by chance at an hotel and that Carlos had told him not to worry about making arrangements for an electrician as he, Carlos, had already arranged for this. In cross-examination the Crown put to the appellant that there was never mention of anyone called Carlos in the intercepted telephone call. The appellant agreed. It was also suggested to him that there was in fact no such person. He denied this. 
      
       
     20 The appellant did not deny in his evidence the intercepted telephone calls but claimed that properly interpreted they did not reveal him as giving instructions to Anastasiou. Furthermore, he said that the $2,000 which he had paid as his share of the customs fees was an investment by him in the machine but that he did not know that the machine contained cocaine. 
      
       
     21 Anastasiou denied any knowledge that the cleaning machine contained drugs. His evidence was that he was an innocent pawn of the appellant. The Crown case accepted this. For his part the appellant claimed that he was the innocent pawn, that he was not at the Lewis Road, Liverpool premises when the arrests took place and that those responsible for the purchase of the machine and importation of the drugs, namely, the El Hassans, Chami and Chatman were unknown to him and that he was no way involved in the importation. No admissions were made by the appellant prior to trial. It was argued on his behalf that the case against him was entirely circumstantial and that Anastasiou, whose evidence was the subject of considerable challenge in cross examination, was the guilty party, not the appellant. 
      
       
     22 An important part of the Crown case consisted of the records of the intercepted telephone conversations. Anastasiou and the appellant each placed different interpretations on such telephone conversations. The Crown case was that a proper understanding of the conversations clearly demonstrated that it was the appellant who was giving the instructions to Anastasiou in respect of the delivery of and other matters relating to the autoclave machine. The appellant contended that it was Anastasiou who was giving such instructions, not he. A clear factual issue was posed in relation to the effect of the intercepted telephone conversations. The resolution of that factual issue was a jury question.  
      
       
        
       ARGUMENTS 
        
        
       Circumstantial Evidence Direction 
        
       
     23 At the trial counsel for the appellant sought a circumstantial evidence direction, but this was refused by the Trial Judge. The Trial Judge stated that the prosecution case was in the main direct in its character. The evidence of Anastasiou, the intercepted telephone calls, the envelope containing $6,120, the steps taken by the appellant in relation to the money, the admitted contribution of $2,000 by the appellant, the visit by the appellant to Anastasiou’s premises following the delivery of the machine to those premises and his instructions not to open the crate in with the machine was housed were relevant in this regard. From the extent of the direct evidence the Trial Judge concluded that the extent of the circumstantial evidence was not great, and was not, of itself, sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellant. In these circumstances the Trial Judge declined to give an express direction as to circumstantial evidence.  
      
       
     24 The Trial Judge did, however, direct the jury as to inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. He instructed the jury that: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this case you are going to be asked to draw inferences. That is something that jurors are asked to do every day. It is commonplace procedure so do not think that something unusual is occurring when that is put before you.  
         
        
        
         
         A Crown is entitled to prove an accused’s intention and conduct by asking the jury to infer from proven facts and circumstances that conduct or intention, provided that the only reasonable and sensible inference to emerge is consistent with the fact asserted by the Crown or the proposition asserted by the Crown. In short, although you are entitled to draw inferences from facts you find proved, you can only draw those inferences provided that they are the only reasonable and rational inferences to emerge from such proven facts.”  
         
        
       
     25 The Trial Judge directed the jury as to the onus and standard of proof. The onus was said to be on the Crown and the standard of proof was correctly stated as being proof beyond reasonable doubt. In this context the Trial Judge directed the jury that: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown has brought this charge against the accused and it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove it and the standard of proof is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no obligation upon the accused to prove nor disprove anything. He does not have to persuade you that inferences contended for by the Crown do not arise. He does not have to persuade you that he did not engage in the importation of this cocaine, that he was not knowingly concerned in that venture, it is for the Crown to prove that he was so engaged. 
         
        
        
         
         You heard that the Crown has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and in the normal case the matters that the Crown would have to prove are firstly that between 1 January 2000 and 12 May 2000 the accused was knowingly concerned in an importation of cocaine, that cocaine is a prohibited import and that the amount of cocaine involved was the commercial quantity, that is in excess of 2 kilograms of pure cocaine.  
         
        
        
         
         Now you have heard (counsel for the accused) say that none of those matters are in issue except the proposition that the accused was knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine. So that is the only issue for your determination, whether the Crown has proved that he was so knowingly concerned in that importation.”  
         
        
        
       and a little later: 
        
        
         
         “You will readily appreciate that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that Michael (sic) Mazzitelli’s activities were involved in the importation of cocaine as distinct from merely the importation of a machine. It is for the Crown to prove that he took steps which actively assisted in the importation of the cocaine.”  
         
        
       
     26 Towards the end of the summing up, the Trial Judge reminded the jury that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although he (the appellant) was not obliged to convince you of anything or to raise any doubts in your mind it was put to you that his sworn denials here before you would have raised a reasonable doubt in your minds as to his guilt when taken with the evidence of the unreliable Anastasiou.”  
         
        
       
     27 These directions, in my opinion, clearly put to the jury what it was that the Crown had to prove concerning the involvement of the appellant in the importation of the cocaine that was inside the autoclave and correctly directed them as to the onus and standard of proof. 
      
       
     28 There is no doubt that the conflict between the evidence of Anastasiou on the one hand and the appellant on the other was important. The Trial Judge’s directions made it clear that there was no onus on the appellant and that, whilst the conflict was important, the case was not merely a contest between the evidence of those two persons. 
      
       
     29 The intercepted phone calls between Anastasiou and the appellant were also important. The original tapes of the conversations and the transcripts of those tapes were before the jury, as were the differing interpretations placed on them by the Crown and the defence. The issue of fact in relation to them was left to the jury, who were reminded of the respective submissions concerning the tapes. The Trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown submits that the clear tenor, the clear flavour that emerges from the calls is that Mazzitelli was directing Anastasiou and that Anastasiou was in effect reporting to Mazzitelli with regard to the progress of the machine, what was happening to it, how it was being moved about and the like.”  
         
        
        
       and left to the jury the question which arose from those intercepted telephone conversations, namely: 
        
        
         
         “You decide from listening to the tapes and your consideration of the transcript who was telling who what to do and who was reporting to the other.”  
         
        
       
     30 The verdict of the jury involves the acceptance of the Crown’s version as to the meaning and effect of the intercepted telephone conversations. 
      
       
     31 The appellant relied on the decision in Regina v Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 as authority for the proposition that a circumstantial evidence direction was required and that failure to give such a direction constituted error on the part of the Trial Judge. In that case Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Smart and McInerney JJ relevantly agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “An accused … need point only to evidence from which it can be said that a reasonable possibility that the circumstances point to someone other than himself as being guilty of (the) offence. If he is able to do so, then a circumstantial direction, in my view, should usually be given in order to enable a jury to go about their task properly.” (at 231) 
         
        
       
     32 It should be noted that the case is not authority for the proposition that a circumstantial evidence direction must be given in every case. Whether such a direction is required or not will depend upon the nature of the case and the extent to which the Crown case depends upon circumstantial evidence. The circumstantial evidence direction sought on behalf of the appellant deals with an aspect of the onus and standard of proof and the drawing of inferences where the Crown case depends wholly or largely on the evidence other than direct evidence.  
      
       
     33 In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 Mason CJ said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “I agree with Dawson J and McHugh J that  
         Chamberlain v The Queen  
         (No. 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 is not authority for the proposition that, in cases based on circumstantial evidence, juries must be directed that they cannot use a fact as a basis for inferring guilt unless that fact is proved beyond reasonable doubt. I am also in general agreement with the reasons given by Dawson J for the conclusion that the giving of such a direction is not required either as a matter of law or in order to ensure conformity with the general standard of proof in criminal cases.” (at 575) 
         
        
       
     34 Dawson J (with whom Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed), said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Trial Judge gave the customary direction that, where the jury relied upon circumstantial evidence, guilt should not only be a rational inference, but should be the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances … whilst a direction of that kind is customarily given in cases turning upon circumstantial evidence, it is no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. In many, if not most, cases involving substantial circumstantial evidence, it will be a helpful direction. In other cases, particularly where the amount of circumstantial evidence involved is slight, a direction in those terms may be confusing rather than helpful. Sometimes such a direction may be necessary to enable the jury to go about their task properly. But there is no invariable rule of practice, let alone of law, that the direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence. It will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether it should be given.” (at 578) 
         
        
        
       and: 
        
        
         
         “… where – to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), para 2497, pp. 412-414 – the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” (at 581). 
         
        
       
     35 McHugh J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If an inference of guilt is open on the evidence, the question for the jury is whether the inference has been proved beyond reasonable doubt – not whether any particular fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.” (at 592) 
         
        
        
       and: 
        
        
         
         “Jurors are under a duty not to find an accused person guilty of an offence unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that person’s guilt. But they are not under a duty to find any particular fact beyond reasonable doubt … To direct the jury that, as a matter of law, they cannot find an accused person guilty of an offence unless they find a particular fact beyond reasonable doubt would be to trespass upon their right to determine whether, upon evidence properly admitted, the guilt of the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.” (at 594)  
         
        
       
     36 In my opinion the above directions given by the Trial Judge were in accordance with authority and were correct and adequate in the circumstances of the particular case.  
      
       
     37 In particular, his Honour came very close to giving the directions sought when he said: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “You can  
           only 
            draw those inferences provided that they are the  
           only 
            reasonable and rational inferences to emerge from such proven facts.” [Emphasis added]” 
           
          
         
        
       
     38 In this regard it should be remembered that Shepherd v The Queen (supra) was itself a case concerned with a conspiracy to import narcotics. The evidence in that case fell into three categories. The first was direct evidence of what was, in effect, an admission by the accused. The second category was evidence given by accomplices. The third category consisted of evidence of financial transactions which the Crown relied on to prove that the accused shared the income of a criminal organisation to which the admissions referred to in the first category referred. The case was thus not one which rested entirely, or largely, on circumstantial evidence.  
      
       
     39 In the present matter, the Crown case was not one that depended wholly or largely on circumstantial evidence. Nor was the Crown case put to the jury, or left by the Trial Judge to the jury, as a contest between the appellant on the one hand and Anastasiou on the other. Anastasiou’s evidence was correctly left to the jury as one, but by no means the only, important element in the case made by the Crown against the appellant. There were other important evidentiary elements. The intercepted telephone calls were one such important element in the Crown case. The directions given in relation to them and the interpretation to be placed upon them were adequate and correct.  
      
       
     40 Having regard to the whole of the evidence I do not think that the Trial Judge erred in refusing to give an express “circumstantial evidence” direction. His directions as to the drawing of inferences and the relationship between the drawing of inferences and the onus and standard of proof that lay on the Crown were in my opinion sufficient in the circumstances of the case. 
      
       
        
       Lowering of standard of proof 
        
       
     41 On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the segment of the summing up referred to in paragraph 29above, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “You decide from listening to the tapes and your consideration of the transcript who was telling who what to do and who was reporting to the other.”  
         
        
        
       involved an error of law in that it “invited the jury to determine on the balance of probabilities who was in control” in that it “effectively lowered the onus of proof”. 
        
       
     42 I do not think that this is correct. The words used do not say that and it is not an implication from what was said. Furthermore, the summing up must be read as a whole and the passage on which counsel for the appellant relied in this regard does not, in my opinion, carry the meaning or have the effect attributed to it on behalf of the appellant. The summing-up clearly, correctly and on more than one occasion directs the jury about the onus and standard of proof that the Crown had to satisfy. Taken as a whole the directions given by the Trial Judge properly left to the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who was giving the directions and that unless they were so satisfied the Crown had not established the charge to the relevant standard. There was, in my opinion, no reversal of the onus of proof or lowering of the standard of proof. 
      
       
        
       Unreliability Warning 
        
       
     43 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his counsel at the trial in effect sought a direction from the Trial Judge as to the unreliability of the evidence of Anastasiou and that although such submission was accepted by the Trial Judge as valid, no unreliability direction was given. The reference relied upon by counsel for the appellant came in the course of a submission that the Trial Judge should give a particular circumstantial evidence direction. It formed part of the following sequence: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour: … This is not a circumstantial evidence case. There is so much direct evidence Mr McCrudden. 
         
        
        
         
         McCrudden: With respect, your Honour, I would submit there is very little direct evidence and that comes only from the telephone intercepts and the admissions that Mr Mazzitelli has himself made in the witness box. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: What about Mr Anastasiou’s evidence?  
         
        
        
         
         McCrudden: Well that is direct evidence, your Honour, but the circumstances in which he gives that mean that as a – legal sense in the circumstances in which he gives that evidence in my submission is not a terribly telling part of the case. It is what the Crown relies upon of course, but by the same token the question of the reliability and accuracy of Mr Anastasiou on his own evidence and the material which he gave when he gave his record of interview to the police, the difference in the statements renders his evidence, if not suspect, just unreliable. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Well, that’s a valid submission, but I don’t know that it’s something that the jury has to accept. Mr McCrudden, as you well know, from your experience in these matters, you can take any witness, you could take Mother Teresa to five accounts of some event that she has given, and you will find inconsistencies. I dare (say) that even Mr Farmer here (Crown Prosecutor) would be detected in some inconsistencies … so the mere fact that there are inconsistencies in those statements …”  
         
        
       
     44 A fair reading of this interchange does not, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that counsel for the appellant had sought a direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including evidence that is within specifically nominated categories. None of these was referred to at the trial by counsel for the appellant. However on appeal it was submitted that, having regard to the allegations made against Anastasiou in cross-examination (all of which were denied), the Trial Judge should nonetheless have given a direction in accordance with the section. 
      
       
     45 The obligation referred to in s 165(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 is triggered in a case in which there is a jury, by a request from a party. The direction given by the section is to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, to inform the jury of the matters that may cause it to be so, and to warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. However such direction is not of universal application, since a judge at trial may decide not to comply with s 165(2) if there are good reasons for not doing so (s 165(3)).  
      
       
     46 Section 165(1) is not an exclusive code in relation to the relevant subject matter. It does not deal with unreliability of witnesses generally. It is directed towards a warning in respect of those categories of cases in which juries should be informed of the accumulated judicial experience concerning such categories. Where the evidence falls within one of those categories, including categories nominated in s 165(1)(a)-(g), juries should be made aware of the need for close analysis of such evidence, of the need for caution in determining whether to accept it and as to the weight they should give to it.  
      
       
     47 It is for a Trial Judge to determine whether the requirements of any of the subsections of s 165(1) have been met. In the present case, it was not expressly put to the Trial Judge that Anastasiou was a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the importation of cocaine the subject of the charge against the appellant. The only basis advanced at the trial was that there were said to be inconsistencies in Anastasiou’s evidence as well as inconsistencies between his evidence and prior statements made to the police.  
      
       
     48 In the course of his summing up, the Trial Judge reminded the jury of the submission that Anastasiou should be regarded as “unreliable” and of the specific argument that had been advanced to the jury in support of such submission, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant has submitted that the only inference to be drawn from Anastasiou’s evidence is that he is unreliable, that inconsistencies in his evidence could be used to raise doubts as to his version of events in particular with regard to the business cards and other crucial matters, for example the payment of the $6,120.”  
         
        
       
     49 From these references and from a more general perusal of the transcript it is clear that no argument was put to the jury that Anastasiou was a person who fell within s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act 1995. Although this is not conclusive as to whether or not a direction under that section or of such a kind should be given, the mode of conduct of the trial, and the absence of any specific request for such a direction, are in my opinion, powerful factors in support of the approach adopted by the Trial Judge in relation to the claimed unreliability of Anastasiou. 
      
       
     50 In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Unfairness of Summing Up 
        
       
     51 The complaint made by the appellant in respect of the summing up under this heading focuses on three areas. The primary complaint relates to the remarks made by the Trial Judge concerning Carlos. The Trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As to Carlos, there was absolutely no mention by the accused between he (sic) and Carlos who he said he first met in March 2000 until they next met completely by chance in a hotel where he, the accused, was buying some beer. No questions were put to Anastasiou to suggest that he and Carlos had been communicating with each other. No suggestion to Anastasiou that Carlos and he were talking about the machine, the importation of the machine, and what is to be done with it. There is simply no evidence that Carlos had anything further to do with either Mazzitelli or Anastasiou between 10 March and 10 May, yet on 10 May, in a sheer chance meeting, Carlos, on the accused’s version of events told him that he was organising an electrician and that he, Mazzitelli, should tell this to Anastasiou. Yet, when Mazzitelli talked to Anastasiou he makes no mention in any of those telephone conversations of having spoken to Carlos, that he met Carlos or that Carlos was going to do anything with regard to providing an electrician.”  
         
        
       
     52 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the inclusion of the word “completely” in the phrase “completely by chance” and the word “sheer” in the phrase “sheer chance meeting” were unfair, and that the reference to no questions being put and no suggestion being made to Anastasiou that Carlos and the appellant were talking about the machine etc, fell squarely within the decision in Regina v Camilleri (2001) NSWCCA 527. 
      
       
     53 The evidence given by the appellant was that he had gone to the Salsbury Hotel, which is about two streets away from his home, to purchase some beer and that when he went in he happened to see Carlos (whose surname was Barbor). The appellant said that Carlos told him to tell Anastasiou not to worry about getting an electrician because he had organised for an electrician to be sent in a tow truck to fix up the machine. The conversation as deposed to by the appellant did not involve any introductory pleasantries. According to the appellant, “he just got up and came over to me”. There were no “hellos” or the like. The cross-examination on this topic was to the effect that having showered and had dinner, the appellant went down to the hotel “just to pick up some beer to take to Hogan’s place to watch the football”. He was then asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: You wouldn’t believe it, but Carlos is in the same pub, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Yes, correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: According to you, you’ve only met this man twice? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Once when you happened upon him at CMP when you wanted a battery?  
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Just because you went there to get a battery, all of a sudden you’re involved in importing a machine from South America, right? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Then you go to the pub to buy some beer to go to your mate’s place? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: And Carlos is there? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Correct.”  
         
        
        
       Having been referred to the tape of the relevant phone call, which took place on the same night the appellant claimed to have happened “to bump into Carlos in the pub” the appellant agreed that there was no mention of Carlos in the conversation. 
        
       
     54 Against this background, I do not think it can properly be said that the inclusion of the words “completely” and “sheer” are unfair, or fall within the criticism that they “did not exhibit that degree of circumspection which (is) required when inviting an inference adverse to the accused” (Regina v Camilleri (supra at p1, para 67)). Furthermore, the references to the absence of cross-examination concerning supposed contact between Anastasiou and Carlos were no more, in my opinion, than a description of the factual situation revealed by the evidence as to the period between March 2000 (when the appellant says he met Carlos at CMP), and May 2000 (when he says he encountered him by chance in the Salsbury Hotel). What is said is not, in my opinion, a criticism of the appellant arising out of the way in which his counsel conducted the defence case. Rather, it is concerned with inherent probabilities or improbabilities, a proper matter for the jury to take into account. It is very different in effect and context from the passage detailed in paragraph 61 of Camilleri.  
      
       
     55 In my opinion, this ground of attack on the summing up fails. 
      
       
     56 Another basis on which the summing up by the Trial Judge was said to be unfair related to the character evidence called on behalf of the appellant. In the summing up, the Trial Judge referred to character evidence and other matters pertaining to the character of the appellant at different parts of the summing up. His first reference to the character witnesses was in the context of absence of mention to close friends of his proposed importation. However, the Trial Judge indicated that he would “return to those witnesses at a later point”. He did this, just as he returned to the fact that the appellant was an employed plumber, had been for some years, that he lived with his family and that the appellant “was simply an employed, hardworking plumber who had demonstrated his industry by doing extra jobs outside of normal hours”. Then, in the course of outlining to the jury the case made by the appellant he reminded the jury that the appellant had “called a number of witnesses who had known him for many years” and that “those character witnesses were unanimous in their opinion of him that he was a hard worker, an honest and reliable family man” and that the people who gave this evidence “were not mere acquaintances” they were people who had known him in various circumstances over the course of years and were people who “had a close and lengthy knowledge of him”. 
      
       
     57 The Trial Judge then correctly directed the jury that they were entitled to “take (the) good character (of the appellant) into account when determining whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the crime with which he is charged” - that is, as going to the unlikelihood of his guilt. He also directed the jury that they could take good character into account “as a factor in assessing his credibility when he denied the charges here before you.”  
      
       
     58 In my opinion, these were adequate directions and are not detracted from by the proper direction that the fact that a person is of good character “does not provide him with some sort of defence” or that “evidence of previous good character cannot prevail against the evidence of guilt which you find to be convincing notwithstanding the accused’s previous good character”. 
      
       
     59 This attack on the summing up fails. 
      
       
     60 A number of residual matters were pointed to in the summing up, for example, there was a complaint about the use of phrases such as “the Crown case”, “in the Crown case”, “the Crown submits”, “the Crown relies upon”, but that when dealing with the appellant’s case, at one stage the Trial Judge said that he was going to put the accused’s case “as I understand it to be”. A perusal of the summing up reveals that a phrase of this kind was used on only two occasions, and that in relation to the Crown case he said, inter alia, “I will be putting the case for the Crown and the case for the accused as they appear to me to emerge from the evidence.” On a fair reading of the summing up, the criticism that is made of it in this regard is without substance. It smacks of nit-picking: a process which should not be undertaken by this Court, which should be concerned with matters of substance. 
      
       
     61 The other matters relied on in this residual category, for example a reference to Mr Anastasiou being in no hurry but no equivalent comment being made in respect of the appellant, are really arguments of fact that appear to have been raised as arguments presented to the jury in the course of the addresses by the respective counsel. None of them individually establishes unfairness in the summing up. 
      
       
     62 In this context, it is relevant to note that quite early in the course of his summing up the Trial Judge informed the jury that: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I fail to refer to some matter of fact which you consider to be important, place no significance upon my omission because it is your view of the facts which count. If I appear to form any views about this matter, you are quite entitled to ignore those views. I do not intend to express any views, but if I give you the impression that I have got some view about the matter, you are entitled to ignore that unless you coincidentally hold the same view.”  
         
        
        
       In addition, he explained to the jury why more time would be spent on the Crown case than on that of the accused, namely: 
        
        
         
         “Firstly, there was a lot more material in the Crown case, and secondly it is for the Crown to prove its case, not the accused to prove or disprove anything.”  
         
        
       
     63 Having looked at each of the matters the subject of specific complaint, it is also appropriate for the Court to stand back and view the summing up as a whole. When this is done, I am of opinion that the attack on it as being unfair is not justified, and fails. 
      
       
        
       Summary as to the appeal against conviction 
        
       
     64 For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the appeal against the conviction of the appellant fails. 
      
       
        
       Severity Appeal 
        
       
     65 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his role in the importation of the cocaine was small and that, having regard to the sentences imposed on others whose roles were said to be greater than that of the appellant, the sentence imposed was excessive. This conclusion was supported by the further submission that the appellant had never been in custody, had no relevant criminal history, was of generally good character and was, as the Trial Judge found, unlikely to re-offend. 
      
       
     66 In his Remarks on Sentence, the Trial Judge found that: 
      
       
        
       (i) the appellant was a party to the arrangements whereby the machine which contained the cocaine was brought from Panama City to Sydney; 
        
        
       (ii) the appellant provided $6,120 in cash to meet customs duties and various fees involved in the importation, and recorded the amount contained in the envelope and the purpose for which such amount was provided; 
        
        
       (iii) the appellant collected and conveyed manuals and other documents relating to the machine to the  
       Customs Broke 
       r, JJ Lawson, in order to enable the machine to be cleared through customs;  
        
        
       (iv) the appellant gave directions to Anastasiou as to the handling of the machine once it had been delivered and instructed him, inter alia, not to open the crate in which the machine had been conveyed to Australia;  
        
        
       (v) there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant had the funds to finance the purchase and consignment of the cocaine from Panama; 
        
        
       (vi) others were involved in financing the purchase; 
        
        
       (vii) the distribution of the cocaine would have involved further organisation, but there was nothing to indicate that the appellant was or would have been part of such further organisation. 
        
        
       The Trial Judge’s ultimate conclusion in relation to the role played by the appellant was: 
        
        
         
         “Clearly, he was entrusted with an important role, indeed a vital role in facilitating the importation by the use of CMP as the ostensible importer, by providing the CMP stationery, by engaging in the essential task involved in the clearing of the crate from customs, by the payment of fees and duties, the collection of the cocaine laden machine and its temporary storage in the premises of CMP Autos … he had an executive function, albeit I do not believe he was responsible for the planning of the venture.”  
         
        
        
       and: 
        
        
         
         “The prisoner’s contribution may have been ever so slightly less serious ( 
         than that of Marouf El Hassan) 
          who received a sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years following a plea of guilty.” (parenthesis added) 
         
        
        
       However, in relation to the prisoner he also found that: 
        
        
         
         “He was not a courier, nor did his role equate with that of a courier or a lowly paid functionary.”  
         
        
        
       and the motivation for the commission of the crime was found to be “sheer greed” on the part of the appellant.  
        
       
     67 The Trial Judge was correctly of opinion that the crime of which the appellant had been convicted was serious and called for a lengthy goal sentence. Because the appellant was not a principal in the venture, (although he played a major - indeed crucial - role in the importation), the Trial Judge decided not to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. He thought the appropriate sentence, unadjusted by virtue of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act), was 28 years. He then made the necessary adjustments, and arrived at the head sentence of 19 years and 8 months referred to in paragraph 2 above. This starting point of 28 years was submitted to be “too high”. 
      
       
     68 In fixing the sentence, the Trial Judge compared the appellant’s role with that of his co-offender Marouf El Hassan. He had pleaded guilty at an early stage, and provided some minimal assistance to the authorities. His sentence was discounted for the utilitarian value of his plea and the assistance he had given. It is thus not appropriate to claim that there is a disparity between the sentence imposed on the appellant when compared with that imposed upon Marouf El Hassan. The situations of the two offenders were different. The discounted sentence of Marouf El Hassan represents 75% of an undiscounted head sentence of 20 years, after due allowance had been made as required by s 16G of the Act. Such an undiscounted head sentence would reflect the slightly greater role played by Marouf El Hassan in the criminal enterprise than that played by the appellant. However, the appellant was not entitled to any discount of the kind earned by Marouf El Hassan by virtue of his early plea of guilty and minor assistance to the authorities.  
      
       
     69 In fixing the sentence, the court is required to have regard to the matters specified in Part 1B of the Act, s 16A(2) of which provides a “checklist” (DPP (Cth) v Said Khodor El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377, per Kirby P, Campbell and Newman JJ) “many of the of matters to which regard is to be had. The principle governing the imposition of a sentence is that specified in s 16A(1) of the Act, the severity of it is “appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. One of those circumstances is the consideration of general deterrence, although this factor is not referred to in the checklist (Regina v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427, per Hunt J; DPP (Cth) v Said Khodor El Karhani (supra)). That factor has rightly been highlighted as important in drug importation cases. This is true at whatever level the person to be sentenced may be in the hierarchy involved in the commission of the offence in question. As was said in Regina v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270: 
      
       
        
         
         “…it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did. “ (supra at 279, para 19) 
         
        
       
     70 In this regard, the observations by Wells J in Le Cerf (1975) 8 ALR 349, are relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is only because persons like him are ready, able and willing to do such a thing that the entrepreneur is able to apply his nefarious trade on a large scale. If there were no middle men and no underlings, there would be no top men in an organisation. If an organisation is starved of recruits, it must collapse.  
         
        
        
         
         The simple truth is that a man who participates in such an organisation at any level – I repeat at any level – must expect, and will receive, a heavy penalty.” (at 351) 
         
        
        
       This passage was approved by Spigelman CJ (with whom McInerney and Sperling JJ agreed) in  
       Regina v Behar  
       (NSWCCA, 14 October 1998, unreported), whilst the line of reasoning embodied in it was expressly adopted by Wood J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Grove J agreed) in  
       Muanchukingkan v Regina  
       (1990) 52 A Crim R 354 at 356. See also  
       Regina v Laurentiu 
        (NSWCCA, 1 October 1992, unreported). 
        
       
     71 Drug offences, including large importations of the kind involved in the present case, are difficult to detect. As a consequence, as was pointed out in Regina v Saxon (1986) 86 A Crim R 353: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the element of general deterrence assumes added importance in the sentencing process.” (at 356 per Dunford J) 
         
        
       
     72 In the present case, the finding by the Trial Judge was that the involvement of the appellant was motivated by “sheer greed”. In such circumstances, the element of specific or personal deterrence must be taken into account, as well as the element of general deterrence. The fact that the legislature has seen fit to impose a maximum sentence that is not less than that which is applicable in the case of murder, is significant. It is indicative of the seriousness with which the community views such offences. In those circumstances a severe sentencing policy has been adopted and it is essential that it be maintained. Ambiguous signals should not be sent to those who engage in, or might be tempted to engage in, the drug importation trade because of the vast profits that can be made from such trade. As was said in Regina v Muanchukingkan (supra): 
      
       
        
         
         “A clear sentencing pattern exists for those involved in the heroin trade, and particularly those who bring that commodity into this country for financial gain. In the absence of a consistently tough sentencing policy, there is nothing to deter overseas purveyors of this drug, or local entrepreneurs out to make quick profits, from perpetuating the trade which poses such a threat to this community and its young. The observations which his Honour (Wells J) made concerning the need for Australian courts to show their muscle to potential traffickers from overseas were not misplaced, and I would express my entire agreement with them.” (supra at 356) 
         
        
        
       This statement applies to cocaine as well as to heroin, the harmful effects of both of which drugs was recognised in  
       Budiman  
       (NSWCCA, 8 September 1998, unreported). 
        
       
     73 Offences of the kind presently in question are treated most seriously by the courts and attract heavy penalties. In this regard, sight should not be lost of the fact that the amount of pure cocaine involved in the offence was more than eight times the commercial quantity fixed by the legislature. 
      
       
     74 The Trial Judge did not apply the most severe penalty that could have been imposed in respect of the conviction. In New South Wales, a life sentence for a man aged 29, as the appellant was at the time of being sentenced, would have involved a sentence that statistically would have been some 45 years in duration. A starting point of 28 years therefore represents a sentence that is significantly less than the maximum that could have been imposed on the appellant.  
      
       
     75 The sentence actually imposed, after appropriate discounts had been made in accordance with s 16G of the Act, should not, in my opinion, be regarded as manifestly excessive, having regard to the degree of involvement of the appellant in the offence, the nature of the drug, the quantity imported, and the fact that the crime was motivated by “sheer greed”. Against such considerations, factors such as the age of the appellant, his previous absence of relevant criminal offences, his reliability and hardworking nature, and the fact that he was likely to be rehabilitated in due course, are fairly reflected in the sentence imposed.  
      
       
     76 In my opinion, it would be inappropriate for this court to intervene in relation to the sentence imposed.  
      
       
     77 For the foregoing reasons I would propose orders as follows: 
      
       
        
       (i) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       (ii) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
        
       (iii) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 12 April 2001 by his Honour Judge Coolahan.  
      
       
     2 The trial before Coolahan DCJ was a retrial consequent upon a decision of this Court in R v MM [2000] NSWCCA 78. At his first trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Job, the applicant was convicted and sentenced in respect of fourteen offences. At the retrial before Coolahan DCJ, the applicant was convicted of eleven of the same charged fourteen offences and acquitted of three of them. 
      
       
     3 Judge Coolahan imposed the same concurrent sentences in respect of each of the eleven offences as had been imposed for those after the first trial. The total effective sentence remained one of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
      
       
     4 In each trial the applicant was indicted for fourteen offences, thirteen of which were sexual in nature. The fourteenth was assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The table appended to these reasons sets out a brief description of each count in the indictment, relevant facts, the outcome in the second trial and the sentences imposed in each trial in respect of which there was a verdict of guilty. From that table it can be seen that the jury found the applicant not guilty of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the second trial for which a fixed term of two years imprisonment had been imposed at the conclusion of the first, and by direction, verdicts of not guilty were returned in relation to counts nine and eleven, indecent assault and sexual intercourse. In respect of the former, a 3-year fixed term had been imposed and the latter, a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 2 years had been imposed. 
      
       
     5 It is to be noted that in the sentencing proceedings before Coolahan DCJ it was accepted by both parties that the sentences previously imposed by Job DCJ were generally appropriate. The applicant’s counsel submitted to his Honour, however, that there should be some reduction with regard to the overall sentence in the light of the fact that the applicant had been acquitted after retrial of three of the counts for which he had previously been convicted and sentenced. That submission was not accepted and the identical sentences were imposed with the same operative head sentence of imprisonment of 8 years and non-parole period of 6 years. The question of special circumstances did not arise. The reasons given by Coolahan DCJ for ordering the same sentences as originally imposed by Job DCJ were, first, the agreement between the parties that the sentences first imposed were appropriate sentences at the time had the convictions not been set aside and secondly: 
      
       
        
         
         “When one reads [Judge Job’s] remarks on sentence it is obvious that he sentenced the offender on the basis of these offences not being totally isolated offences involving their own separate acts of criminality as such but on the basis of the context in which the offences were committed. That is not to say of course that his Honour sentenced the offender on the basis of misconduct not charged in the indictment, but it is clear from the sentences themselves and the way they were structured that his Honour did take into account the background against which they were committed”. 
         
        
       
     6 The applicant contends that as a consequence the operative sentences imposed by Coolahan DCJ represent, effectively, an “increase”. It is argued for the applicant that in the light of the acquittals on the retrial, the learned sentencing Judge effectively “increased” the sentences on the remaining counts beyond the sentences that were imposed at the earlier trial “without good reason” being demonstrated for doing so. 
      
       
     7 The fundamental proposition of principle advanced for the applicant is that after a retrial sentences should not be increased unless, generally, there are good reasons for so doing.  
      
       
     8 The first authority to which the applicant points is the decision of Street CJ in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416. In that case the applicant had received a total effective sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 6 ½ years for four offences. This was after a retrial following a successful appeal against conviction. At his first trial he had been sentenced for the same offences to a total effective period of 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Street CJ examined the English Criminal Appeal Act which made specific provision limiting the sentence to be passed upon conviction at a retrial to one of no greater severity than that passed on the original conviction. He found that there were two underlying policy considerations. First, that absent such a provision, persons convicted at trial in which there was some appealable defect should not be deterred from seeking a remedy on appeal for fear of receiving a greater sentence on retrial. Secondly, that the passing of a heavier sentence on a new trial would give the impression, albeit groundless, that the criminal justice system involved a element of retribution in respect of those who succeeded in having their convictions overturned on appeal. Although there was no similar provision within the New South Wales legislation, he regarded these policy considerations as equally applicable and held that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is a sound principle of sentencing that, on a new trial consequent upon the quashing of a conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the accused should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than those following upon the first trial” (at 419). 
         
        
       
     9 Gilmore’s sentence was quashed and he was re-sentenced in terms identical to the original sentence. 
      
       
     10 The issue was considered again in R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711. The appellant had been convicted at a trial involving groups of sexual offences concerning two complainants. Nine counts involving the first complainant yielded sentences totalling 6 ½ years and 2 counts involving the second complainant yielded cumulative sentences of 3 ½ years. Against the total effective sentence of 10 years there was specified a non-parole period of 5 years. It was held on appeal, in effect, that there should have been separate trials for each complainant, the convictions and sentences were quashed and there was an order for new trials. At the re-trial relating to the first complainant Bedford was again convicted of all counts and again sentenced to a total of 6 ½ years to run from the date of verdict in that trial. A non-parole period of 3 years was specified. At the time of his appeal he was still to be re-tried in respect of the offences concerning the second complainant. It was contended, in effect, that the sentences relating to the first complainant had effectively been increased because no regard was had to a period of 7 ½ months custody following the first trial.11 Street CJ referred to what he had said in Gilmore (the passage extracted above) and explained: 
      
       
        
         
         “lt is significant to emphasise that the enunciation of the principle includes 'should ordinarily not receive' The word 'ordinarily’ must be given full room to operate. It might perhaps have been preferable to have expressed this as a prima facie approach rather than elevating it to principle. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Where the judge at the new trial considers that the circumstances of the case do call for a longer sentence he will not be absolutely fettered by the approach prima facie to be adopted. He is both at liberty, and indeed obliged, to give effect to his own assessment. It could be expected, however, that if he did take the view that a longer sentence were called for than that passed at the first trial, then there would be a specific indication of the reasons leading him to his view"" 
          (713-714). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     12 Both Gilmore and Bedford were recently considered by this Court in R v Merritt [2000] NSWCCA 365. The sentence in question was, effectively, one involving a minimum term of 9 years with an additional term of 5 years. This was identical to the disposition of the matter at a first trial before convictions were quashed on appeal to this Court. In conjunction with the conviction appeal the Court also had before it a Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of sentence. Although it became unnecessary for the Crown appeal to be determined, the Court took the opportunity to express the view that the sentence was “so lenient as to indicate a failure by the learned sentencing judge properly to apply his discretion”. After the retrial, the sentencing judge expressed a similar view as to the inadequacy of the sentence originally imposed but felt constrained to impose the same because of what was said in Gilmore and Bedford. O’Keefe J (Beazley JA and Smart AJ agreeing) examined Gilmore and Bedford and endorsed what was said in the latter as to the existence of a discretion in the second sentencing judge to depart from the original sentence when there were proper reasons to do so. Accordingly, it was held that the sentencing judge had erred in regarding himself as constrained by Gilmore and Bedford to impose the same sentence notwithstanding his view that it was inadequate. The sentence was quashed and a new sentence, of 18 years with a non-parole period of 13 ½ years imposed (see also R v Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 380). 
      
       
     13 In this context the Crown referred to a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court on an appeal from Supreme Court of the ACT: Campbell v The Queen; Baker v The Queen [1996] FCA 1 (11 September 1996) in which the Federal Court had occasion to consider a case in which the convictions at retrial were for less offences than in the original proceedings. At his first trial, Baker was convicted of five counts and sentenced to a total effective sentence of 5 years (5 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 5) with a non-parole period of 2 years. At his retrial he was convicted of three of those counts and sentenced to a total effective sentence of 4 years (4 + 4 + 3 = 4) with a non-parole period of 18 months. Two of the counts carried a maximum penalty of 10 years and/or 1,000 penalty units. The third count had no defined maximum penalty, it being a common law offence. The two counts for which he was not sentenced at the retrial carried maximum penalties of 10 years and/or 1,000 penalty units in one case and 25 years imprisonment in the other. It was held that the reduction in the head sentence from 5 years to 4 years was a substantial one and reflected the changed circumstances. In relation to the non-parole period, complaint was made that there was no effective reduction because of the fact that the appellant had spent in excess of 5 months in custody between the first trial and his successful appeal. That is, he would be required to serve a custodial period about three weeks short of the original non-parole period. Despite this complaint, the Court held that the sentence imposed was within the discretion of the sentencing judge. It was recognised that the practical difficulty he faced was “to keep the reduction within bounds such that the sentence would not fail to reflect the inherent gravity of the offences”. 
      
       
     14 The present applicant contends that there was “no good reason” for the effective “increase” imposed upon him. Although it is true, it is submitted, that there a number of concurrent sentences, that submission of the appellant is supported, it is said, by what is described as the “core” of the High Court requirement for “transparency” with regard to original sentences in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. It is submitted that there should be “some reduction” in the head sentence and a commensurate reduction in the non-parole period. 
      
       
     15 For the applicant it was suggested that a reduction in the head sentence beyond 16 months and a reduction in the non-parole period beyond 12 months could not be, and was not, sought. 
      
       
     16 The authorities referred to above, could be understood as demonstrating that where the convictions following a retrial are fewer than in the original proceedings, two factors provide an important guide in the approach to sentencing. The first is the manner in which the first sentencing judge applied the totality principle (it was so regarded in Bedford). The second is the overall requirement that the sentence must be one that appropriately reflects the objective gravity of the offences.17 Traditionally, there have been a number of ways in which the totality principle has been accommodated when sentencing for multiple offences. In Griffiths v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 372, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is well established that in sentencing a person in respect of multiple offences regard must be had to the total effect of the sentence on the offender. This may be done through the imposition of consecutive sentences of reduced length with or without other sentences to be served concurrently or through the imposition of a head sentence appropriate to the total criminality with all other sentences to be served concurrently” (at 393). 
         
        
       
     18 In Pearce a re-assessment of the application of the principle was made with the requirement that:  
      
      
       
        
         
         “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"" 
          (per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 624). 
         
         
          
         
        
       
     19 The number of counts, and the manner in which the totality principle is applied, can throw up a variety of situations. A simple case might involve multiple, but few, offences where, in the original sentencing exercise, the sentences are specified to be served consecutively and there is no need for compression of any of the sentences to take into account the principles of totality. There may be little difficulty in sentencing on a re-trial, where the offender has been convicted of some and acquitted of others, in simply imposing the same sentences as originally passed (subject to there being no other relevant considerations).20 A more difficult example is provided by a case in which there has been, in the original sentencing exercise, an order that sentences be served consecutively, or partly consecutively, together with some compression of individual sentences because of considerations of totality. In such a case, upon a retrial where there is conviction for some offences, but not all, it would be appropriate that there be some relaxation of the compression of the individual sentences. That is, it would be appropriate for the individual sentences to be increased. A different situation arises in the present case where discrete sentences were determined in respect of each offence but there was an order that each be served concurrently. This is similar to the situation in Campbell v The Queen; Baker v The Queen, supra, but a significant difference, it is said, is the number of counts and the proportion that were the subject of conviction at the re-trial.21 Some reference to these situations appears in R H McL v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 452. The appellant had been convicted of 16 offences for which was imposed a total effective sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The Victorian Court of Appeal quashed the convictions with regard to 4 offences and ordered that there be a new trial. However, in applying s569(1) Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) (the equivalent of s7(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)), it increased the sentences for the remaining counts so that the total effective sentence remained one of 12 years with a 10 year non-parole period. It was common ground that if there had been no alteration of the sentences on the remaining counts they would have been rendered manifestly inadequate.22 The approach of the sentencing judge in relation to the principle of totality was regarded as being of significance. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         34 …Much may depend upon the manner in which the sentence judge has applied that principle. If the judge has followed the course recommended in the cases  
         of  
         Mill 
           
         and  
         Lomax,  
         and responded to considerations of totality, not by reducing individual sentences, but by fixing individually appropriate sentences and making them wholly or partly concurrent, then no occasion to invoke s 569(1) may arise. On the other hand, if, as in the present case, a sentence judge has given effect to considerations of totality partly by imposing individual sentences which were less than they would otherwise have been, then that is the very kind  
         of  
         case which may call for an exercise  
         of  
         the power to re-sentence under s 569(1)”. 
          
         
        
       
     23 Similarly, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “44 The Court of Appeal was entitled to increase the remaining sentences because they were imposed for offences which were part of a continuing course of criminal conduct by the appellant and those individual sentences did not reflect the appropriate punishment for the offences for which they were imposed. That was because Judge Harbison had compressed the individual sentences to ensure, that their totality did not reflect more than proper punishment for the course of the criminal conduct"". 
          
         
        
       
      and, 
      
       
        
         
         “75 In modem times, s 569(1) of the Act is likely to have its most frequent operation in circumstances where the sentencing judge has compressed sentences by reason of the totality principle. There would be less occasion for the Court of Appeal to exercise its powers under that sub-section if sentencing judges imposed the sentence appropriate in respect of each conviction and then gave effect to the totality principle, where that principle did require a reduction of the cumulative effect of the sentences, by making concurrent any sentence or sentences that conflicted with the totality principle"". 
         
        
       
     24 (The latter joint judgment includes (at [72]) an endorsement of what was referred to in Bedford as the ""prima facie approach"" with reference to the policy considerations referred to in Gilmore).25 Factors relevant to the re-sentencing power of an appeal court after quashing only some of an appellant's convictions are equally relevant to a sentencing exercise when there has been a conviction for some, but not all, offences on a re-trial. As Bedford and McL demonstrate, the manner in which the totality principle has been accommodated in the initial sentencing exercise will guide the subsequent determination of the appropriate sentence. It may provide sound reason to depart from the ""prima facie approach” of imposing no greater sentence than that initially imposed.26 The appellant's argument is, in effect, that in a case in which concurrent sentences have been imposed in the original proceedings and where there is an acquittal for some offences in the subsequent proceedings, there should ordinarily be a reduction in the total effective sentence. In the appellate environment, this would occur through recourse to the court's powers under s7(1). If this is something that should ordinarily occur, it was not recognised as such by the High Court. It is implicit in the above extracts from the two joint judgments that their Honours contemplated the usual course where there are concurrent sentences would be for the appellate court not to resort to its power to alter the remaining sentences. 
      
       
     27 In the present case, as has been mentioned, it was conceded before Coolahan DCJ that the sentences imposed by Job DCJ were appropriate. The only issue was whether the sentences should be altered because of the acquittal in respect of three counts and also because of what was asserted to be the delay arising from the subsequent successful appeal against conviction in the first trial. Further, for the applicant, it was contended that an additional fundamental consideration in the circumstances with which the Court presently is concerned, is that of “fairness” to the applicant. 
      
       
     28 For the Crown the following six relevant considerations were advanced as required to be considered: first, the extent of the difference in the number of offences (here the applicant was convicted of what was described as a major proportion of those originally charged). Secondly, the extent of the difference in the objective gravity of the offences (here, briefly stated, the objective gravity of the found offences in the second trial were such as independently to warrant sentences to the same effect as those imposed as a result of the first trial). Thirdly, there is to be taken into account the manner in which the original sentences were ordered to be served (concurrently), and the manner in which the original sentencing judge accommodated the principle of totality (here, conformably with Pearce, each offence was separately sentenced and the separate sentences, to achieve totality, were ordered to be served concurrently). Fifthly, (following Merritt) where the proper exercise of the discretion of the second sentencing judge leads to a conclusion that the sentences imposed at the first trial were “inadequate”, the second sentencing judge is not bound to impose any greater effective sentence. Sixthly, in all cases, the primary consideration is that the sentences must properly reflect the objective gravity of the individual offences and the total effective sentence must pay heed (as was contended to have occurred in this case) to the principle of totality.  
      
       
     29 It was contended for the Crown that this was a case in which the totality principle was applied by the specification of individual sentences each one appropriate to its individual offence with an order that they be served concurrently, and thus it is not necessary for the sentences to be reduced. For example, if a total sentence of 8 years was appropriate in respect of count five, it remains so upon conviction in respect of that count at the second trial. In other words, there has been no effective increase in the applicant’s sentence. 
      
       
     30 The authorities confirm the discretion which reposes in the judge sentencing after the retrial to make an independent assessment as to the appropriate punishment. Here, it must be demonstrated why a totally effective sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years was beyond the scope of the sentencing discretion exercised by Coolahan DCJ.  
      
       
     31 The individual sentences of 8 years with non-parole periods of 6 years for counts five and twelve to fourteen were within the scope of the second sentencing judge’s discretion. Counts six and nine had initially attracted concurrent fixed terms of 2 years and 3 years respectively; acquittal on those counts do not justify a reduction in the sentence appropriate for counts five and twelve-fourteen. As the Crown submitted, rhetorically, why should acquittal on count eleven, which was initially determined to warrant a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, bring about any reduction in the sentence imposed upon the applicant for counts five and twelve-fourteen which were determined to be worthy of the same level of punishment?  
      
       
     32 The series of decisions referred to above provides for the application, in a principled way, of a convention in sentencing. It may be to some extent described as cognate with “double jeopardy”. Certainly, in my view, it cannot be said that those cases establish a “rule”. Irrespective of whether the view could be formed that the first set of sentences was manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive, it has to be recognised that the second sentencing judge is not “resentencing” but exercising an independent sentencing discretion with respect to the offences of which the particular offender has been convicted. Of course it will be the case that if sentence “x” is imposed in relation to fourteen offences and the same sentence “x” is imposed in relation to eleven of those fourteen offences, it can be perceived that the sentence has been “increased”. The explanation for the “increase” or the “good reason” therefor, should be identifiable by the exposed application of principle to that (second) independent sentencing exercise. 
      
       
     33 In the instant application the Crown’s rhetorical question referred to above must be answered, in my view, to the effect that there was no reason for any reduction. An examination of Judge Coolahan’s reasons, taking into account “fairness”, taking into account no suggestion of “inadequacy” in relation to Judge Job’s sentences, discloses the principled application of the convention to which I have referred. Looking at the circumstances of the convictions at the second trial, the quantum of each sentence in relation to each found offence is appropriate and the principle of totality correctly reflected in this instance by concurrence. The criminality involved in the found offences is such as to warrant the sentences imposed. That conclusion is available irrespective of an available fine discrimination of the kind advanced by the applicant to the effect “less findings of guilt therefore less criminality”. This last proposition may well apply in another case; indeed, as oral submissions reflected, the examples of the variables can be endless. 
      
       
     34 Thus I am persuaded that no error in principle in the peculiar situation attending his Honour Judge Coolahan’s sentencing exercise has been exposed. In any event, I add, having regard to the criminality which fell to be punished upon the findings of guilt in the second trial, it was persistent and enduring for an extensive period and involved the extreme mistreatment of a young child. No other sentence would otherwise have been warranted pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
     35 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.  
      
       
     36 HIDDEN J: I agree with Levine J. 
      
       
     37 HOWIE J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Levine J in draft. I agree with his Honour’s proposed orders and generally with his reasons for them. I merely wish to add some brief observations of my own in addition to what his Honour has written. 
      
       
     38 This is yet another endeavour to turn sentencing into a mathematical exercise governed by a rigidity of approach which is the very antithesis of the exercise of discretion, albeit a discretion exercised in accordance with established principles and with due consideration to relevant guidelines or relevant statistical information as to the exercise of a similar discretion in similar situations. 
      
       
     39 In the present case the sole argument relied upon for asserting that the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried was that less criminality must result in less punishment. In the arithmetical way that the argument was advanced before this Court it was asserted that conviction of eleven offences in the second trial had to result in a lesser sentence than was considered to be appropriate for conviction of fourteen offences at the first trial. But as attractive as that argument might be to a mathematician, it is an over-simplification of the proper approach to sentencing for multiple offences generally, and the sentencing exercise undertaken by both Judge Job and Judge Coolahan in particular. It attributes to the exercise of the sentencing discretion an exactitude that is as unrealistic as it is unwarranted. 
      
       
     40 The approach also seeks to compare the exercise of the discretion by the two sentencing judges rather than to focus upon the discretion exercised by Judge Coolahan. The question for this Court is concerned with the correctness of the sentence imposed by Judge Coolahan for the offences for which the applicant was convicted before him. His Honour was to impose a sentence appropriate to that criminality. The fact that his Honour came to the conclusion that the sentence imposed by Judge Job was also appropriate to reflect the criminality before him does not on its face suggest that the sentence was erroneous. As I understand the argument before this Court, it was not suggested that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive if the sentence imposed by Judge Job were disregarded. 
      
       
     41 How then can it be that his Honour’s sentence miscarried? Reliance is placed upon the convention that Levine J has reviewed in relation to sentencing after a re-trial. I doubt that the prima facie approach referred to in R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711 applies in this case. I find a substantial degree of artificiality in considering the sentence imposed by Judge Coolahan to be an increase in the sentence imposed by Judge Job. Judge Coolahan imposed the sentence he believed was appropriate and was not prepared to reduce the sentence simply in recognition that Judge Job imposed the same sentence for more offences. 
      
       
     42 Further, I do not understand how the policy considerations behind the general approach to sentencing after a re-trial that are referred to in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416 apply to the situation before Judge Coolahan. How could a convicted person be deterred from seeking to appeal because the same sentence was imposed after re-trial albeit for fewer offences? How could there be a perception that the sentence had an element of retribution for the applicant having succeeded on appeal? In any event, as Levine J has shown, there was good reason for Judge Coolahan to impose a heavier sentence than that imposed by Judge Job, if, contrary to my view, that is how the sentence should be regarded and accepting that the convention after re-trial did apply. 
      
       
     43 I have indicated that in my view the appropriate task is to consider the exercise of the discretion by Judge Coolahan and not to compare and contrast the sentence imposed by his Honour with that imposed by Judge Job in order to determine whether any error occurred. But even if the sentence imposed by Judge Coolahan is considered from the perspective of the sentence imposed by Judge Job, no error is apparent. Judge Job, in accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, determined the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each offence and then dealt with the question of totality of criminality by making all sentences concurrent. In other words, he determined that the appropriate sentence for the most serious offence was adequate to address the total criminality arising from what was a continued course of criminal conduct. Why then should those sentences be disturbed, if they remain appropriate to reflect the criminality of each offence, simply because there were now less offences within the course of criminal conduct before the court? To reduce the sentence for any one offence in order to affect the total sentence imposed would risk infringing the principle in Pearce. 
      
       
     44 In a case such as the present, where there is a course of criminal conduct between the offender and the victim over a lengthy period of time and involving multiple offences of the same or similar nature arising from the same motivation (in this case sexual gratification), the totality of criminality resulting from that course of conduct is particularly unsusceptible to precise calculation. Generally speaking, the extent of the criminality will be unlikely to vary significantly with the addition or reduction in particular incidents relied upon as revealing the course of conduct. Certainly, it was well open to Judge Coolahan to determine that the absence of the three offences from the criminality that was before Judge Job made no appreciable difference to the extent of the criminality disclosed by the course of conduct in which the applicant had been engaged for nearly six years as revealed by the offences before him. 
      
       
     45 Ultimately counsel for the applicant, who argued the matter with considerable skill and conviction, relied upon the general notion of fairness to support his submission that this Court should intervene. As I understand the argument, it was submitted that the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance if he were to receive the same sentence as imposed by Judge Job notwithstanding that he had been convicted of less offences. But, if it is accepted that the sentence imposed is appropriate to the criminality before Judge Coolahan and if any lesser sentence is not warranted, why should this Court intervene? How can the applicant have a sense of grievance to which this Court should have regard? The result is explained by the principle of totality and the manner in which each sentencing judge attempted to impose an overall sentence in accordance with that principle. If the applicant has a grievance, it is not one that this Court should in the exercise of its discretion seek to redress.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant Gary Alexander Timu pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The offence was committed on 27 June 2001. 
      
       
     2 The charge was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         On 27 June 2001, at HABERFIELD in the state of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Kim Ashcroft, situate at 7/121 Parramatta Road, and therein did commit a serious indictable offence, namely Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely knowing at the time of the said breaking and entering that there was a person in the said dwelling house. 
         
        
       
     3 On 5 April 2002, the applicant was sentenced by Nield DCJ to a term of imprisonment of two years and three months with a non-parole period of nine months. The applicant applies for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was born on 26 April 1969. He was, accordingly, 32 years of age at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     5 The Crown case, is summarised in the applicant’s written submissions as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The Complainant and the Applicant had been in a romantic relationship for about 3 years prior to 27 June 2001. At about 8.30pm on that date the Complainant heard a knock at the front door of her residence. She looked through the peep hole in the door and saw the Applicant. The front door was secured by a security latch. After seeing the Applicant, the Complainant slightly opened the door and had a conversation with the Applicant. The Complainant told the Applicant to “ 
         go away and leave me alone 
         ” and closed the front door. She then went to the phone in her unit and dialled “ 
         000 
         ”. The Applicant forced the front door with his hands, breaking the security latch. He then entered the unit, grabbed the telephone cord and unplugged the phone from the wall. The Applicant was then alleged to have grabbed the Complainant by the hair and forced the back of her head against the concrete wall of the unit about 3 times, calling the Complainant a “ 
         stupid bitch 
         ”. The Applicant then started slapping the Complainant across her face with both hands causing swelling to the left side of the Complainant’s face and a split lip. The Applicant is then alleged to have punched the Complainant to the left side of her face with a closed fist and punched the Complainant in the stomach twice, winding her. She gasped for air and the Applicant slapped her across the face. The Applicant is alleged to have said to the Complainant “ 
         If you go to the Police, I will hunt you down and have you killed 
         ”. It was alleged that the Applicant also grabbed the Complainant by the throat and punched her in an upwards fashion. About 1.30am on 28 June 2001 the Complainant went to bed; the Applicant followed her. He got into the same bed and went to sleep; the Complainant lay awake all night too scared to move. About 6.00am on 28 June 200 the Applicant got up, dressed, leaned over the Complainant and caressed her swollen cheek, said “ 
         I love you 
         ” and left. The Complainant then got up, dressed and left for work. When she got to work she reported the matter to her Manager who in turn arranged for a Counsellor. After finishing work the Complainant’s mother drove her from work at Pyrmont to the Penrith Police Station where she made a statement of complaint.  
         
        
        
         
         It was the Prosecution case that as a result of the assault, the Complainant received lumps to the back of her head, minor bruising to her neck and wrists and soreness to her back, together with a small cut on the left corner of her mouth.  
         
        
       
     6 The foregoing account of events was supported by the complainant in her statement to the police and in her evidence on the sentencing hearing.  
      
       
     7 In his account, given to the police when apprehended and as given in evidence at the sentencing hearing, the applicant admitted that he broke into the complainant’s apartment, that, having seen her using the telephone, he pulled the line from the wall, and that he slapped the applicant on the face more than once, causing a cut to the left corner of her mouth. He denied that he had grabbed the complainant’s hair and pushed her head against the concrete wall of the unit (three times), punched the complainant on the left side of her face with a closed fist, punched the complainant in the stomach (twice) or that he had threatened to kill her. 
      
       
     8 An outline of injuries suffered by the complainant appeared from a statement by a general practitioner, Dr Labib. How much of that was observation by the doctor and how much was hearsay through the complainant was in dispute. 
      
       
     9 Concerning the extent to which the applicant may have been affected by alcohol, the following is an extract from the applicant’ s evidence in chief given at the sentencing hearing. 
      
       
        
         
         Q: How much did you have to drink? 
          
         A: I think it would be four or five schooners. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Are you a regular beer drinker? 
         
        
       A: Not really, no. 
        
        
         
         Q: Were you intoxicated when you left the pub? 
          
         A: Fairly intoxicated, yes sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Did you intend to go to Ms Ashcroft’s apartment after you left the pub? 
          
         A: No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: When did you form that intention? 
          
         A: I found myself walking towards that way after I had gone out to Summer Hill to buy some cigarettes and that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: What was the address you were living at when the incident happened? 
          
         A: Unit 2, 34 Thomas Street, Leichhardt. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Well, why did you go to the apartment?  
          
         A: To be quite honest I don’t really know, but when I did find myself there our relationship had been such that every time we did break up we always ended up in a huge argument between her and myself, it always ended up bad, but for once, just once try to end it on a better note, I guess, and just get some good closure on it. Just carry on, get on with our own lives, that’s about it. 
         
        
       
     10 The sentencing judge made no finding against the applicant in relation to the threat, but he found that the applicant otherwise did as the complainant asserted and that she received the injuries as alleged by her. In doing so, he resolved the conflict between the two accounts in the following way.  
      
       
     11 His Honour said he was not assisted by the demeanour of the two witnesses. He went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         However, there is one piece of evidence which assists me in rejecting the evidence of the offender. At least in rejecting his evidence to some extent. The fact that he had consumed a quantity of intoxicating liquor and was, as he told police, “tiddly” because of his consumption permits me to say that I doubt his memory, at least the accuracy of his memory, as to what occurred in what must have been a relatively short period of time from when he pushed open the door into the complainant’s unit. 
         
        
       
     12 His Honour did not accept the complainant’s evidence completely. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         I accept the complainant’s evidence as to what the offender did to her but I think that she, not unexpectedly, is herself unable to be precise as to exactly what occurred from when it was that the offender pulled the telephone cord out of the socket on the wall. That is not to say that I do not accept her as doing her best to remember what happened, but the very fact of being confronted by a former boyfriend when he was to some extent intoxicated and after he had broken into her home would, it seems to me, so surprise and confuse her that she may not be precise as to everything that had occurred. 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour then made the following findings: 
      
       
        
         
         Having said those things, I accept, however, that she was pushed against the wall and that the back of her head hit the wall and that she was punched with a closed fist, and not slapped with an open hand, and that she was punched to the stomach as a result of which she lost her breath. 
         
        
       
     14 The finding made by the sentencing judge in relation to the likely effect of alcohol on the applicant’s capacity to remember with accuracy what had occurred was central to his Honour's reasoning. There was a sufficient basis in the evidence for that finding. 
      
       
     15 His Honour then reviewed the relevant subjective considerations in relation to the applicant. There were some property offences during adolescence. However, the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had, relevantly, an unblemished character, confirmed by the police report and by testimonials tendered in evidence. 
      
       
     16 His Honour allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s early plea of guilty. He did not doubt that the applicant’s expressions of contrition were genuine. He did not think there was any prospect of the applicant re-offending and, accordingly, there was nothing that needed to be done by way of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     17 The sentence imposed represented a head sentence of three years, discounted by 25 per cent. 
      
       
     18 His Honour found special circumstances, namely, the applicant’s prior unblemished character, that he had not previously served a prison sentence and that he was unlikely to re-offend. The provisional statutory non-parole period was accordingly reduced from two years and three months (three quarters of the sentence) to nine months (one third of the sentence). 
      
       
     19 His Honour gave specific consideration to whether full time custody could be avoided in favour of some other penalty. He found himself unable to do so by reason of what he regarded as the serious nature of the offence and its effect on the victim. 
      
       
        
       Misleading evidence 
        
       
     20 There is a disturbing aspect of the evidence given by the applicant at the sentencing hearing. Our papers include the applicant’s criminal history in New Zealand. Relevantly, in 1984, he was convicted in the District Court at Hastings, New Zealand, of robbery by assault, for which he was sentenced to four months imprisonment with probation for one year thereafter. This information was not before the court when the applicant was sentenced here in April 2002. 
      
       
     21 The following is an extract from the evidence given in chief by the applicant at the sentencing hearing on 5 April 2002. 
      
       
        
         
         Q: And have you ever been convicted of any criminal offences? 
          
         A: No. 
          
         
        
       
     22 That answer was untrue. It misled the court. The sentencing judge specifically found that the applicant had “an unblemished character”. There was evidence of commendable progress by the applicant in rehabilitating himself pending sentence. However, it seems likely that the evidence of prior good character contributed to the finding made by his Honour that it was unlikely that the applicant would re-offend. That, in turn, led his Honour to conclude that specific deterrence was not as important as it might otherwise have been. 
      
       
     23 Additionally, that this was to be the applicant’s first time in prison was a factor which his Honour specifically took into account in determining that there were special circumstances warranting a reduction in the length of the non-parole period. That is a second way in which the misleading evidence came to bear on the result. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of appeal 
        
       
     24 The applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal:  
      
       
        
         
         (1) His Honour the learned sentencing judge did not apply the correct onus and standard of proof in finding the facts upon which the sentence was to be passed. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) There was too fragile a basis, on the evidence, to make a finding that the applicant: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) Grabbed the complainant’s hair and pushed the complainant’s head against the concrete wall of the unit three times; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) Punched the complainant on the left side of her face with a closed fist; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (c) Punched the complainant to the stomach twice; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Threatened to kill the complainant.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) The sentence was, in the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
         
        
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
     25 In relation to disputed facts going to aggravation of the offence, the burden of proof was on the prosecution and the standard of proof was proof beyond reasonable doubt: Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. The trial judge did not state those principles. However, it cannot be doubted that a judge of Nield DCJ’s experience intended to apply them. It follows that his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the factual matters in dispute.  
      
       
     26 The real question is whether it was open to his Honour to be so satisfied on the evidence before him.  
      
       
     27 His Honour accepted the evidence of the complainant to the extent necessary to support the findings which he made. There was a rational basis for doing so, notwithstanding the applicant’s evidence to the contrary, namely, the likely impairment of the applicant’s capacity to remember accurately what had occurred because of the alcohol he had consumed. It was, accordingly, open to his Honour, in these circumstances, to be satisfied of the matters in question to the requisite standard of proof. 
      
       
     28 For these reasons, this ground of appeal must fail. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
     29 The applicant’s submissions in support of ground 2 amount to there having been a paucity of corroboration for the complainant’s testimony in relation to disputed acts on the part of the applicant and in relation to the nature and extent of injury alleged.  
      
       
     30 Paucity of corroboration or, indeed, lack of corroboration, does not preclude a tribunal of fact from being satisfied of matters in issue beyond reasonable doubt. It was clear that much of what the complainant alleged lacked corroboration. There is no reason to suppose that this escaped his Honour’s attention when evaluating the weight to be given to her evidence. 
      
       
     31 This ground of appeal, accordingly, fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
     32 The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. It was within the range of a proper exercise of sentencing discretion. That is so on the evidence before his Honour. It is the more so on the true facts, which include the applicant’s prior criminal record of which his Honour was unaware. 
      
       
        
       Result 
        
       
     33 I propose that leave to appeal be allowed and that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     34 Buddin J: I agree with Sperling J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant Zare Antin Kirikian was charged with two offences, being, in each instance, knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, heroin, contrary to s25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000. 2 The offences were committed respectively on 15 October and 18 November 2000. 
      
       
     3 The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges at the Local Court. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was sentenced by Patten DCJ to a term of imprisonment of six years for the first offence with a non-parole period of three years. The sentence was dated from 14 December 2000, being the date of the applicant’s arrest and the date from which the applicant had been in custody in relation to the present matters. 
      
       
     5 The same sentence was imposed for the second offence, to be served concurrently with the first sentence. 
      
       
     6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal in relation to those sentences. 
      
       
     7 The facts of the case are not in dispute. They are recorded in detail in the remarks on sentence. There were two distinct transactions for the sale of heroin. These involved the prisoner and five co-offenders. The applicant’s role was that of a broker. He obtained access to the drugs for the purchasers, and he played an active role in negotiating the transactions and arranging for payment and delivery. The co-offender Sukkar was on the purchasing side of one of the transactions. The co-offender Nguyen was on the supply side in relation to both transactions. 
      
       
     8 Each of the transactions was for the sale of two blocks of heroin. The applicant was to receive a commission of $2,000 per block in relation to the first transaction. The amount of his remuneration in relation to the second transaction is not known with any certainty.  
      
       
     9 In relation to the first transaction, payment had been made and the heroin had been delivered when the police intervened. The drugs were seized. That led to the second transaction. In relation to that transaction, a down payment had been made and the heroin was about to be delivered when the police again intervened.  
      
       
     10 In total, the four blocks of heroin had a nett weight of 1.4 kilograms, with a street value estimated at $1.4m. 
      
       
     11 The sentencing judge found that the applicant was actively and extensively involved in the supply of the drug on each of the two occasions. That evidence was amply justified by the detailed facts relating to the transactions. The applicant’s role involved him in interstate travel, numerous telephone and personal contacts, and extensive negotiations which included initiative and deception on his part. 
      
       
     12 Concerning subjective considerations relating to the applicant, the sentencing judge noted that the applicant was born on 1 May 1956. He was, accordingly, 44 years of age at the time of the offences. His criminal antecedents included, among relatively minor offences, a conviction for supplying a prohibited drug, cannabis leaf, for which he received a sentence of imprisonment for four years with a minimum term of two years. 
      
       
     13 A pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report were in evidence. These revealed that the applicant had a troubled childhood with an abusive and violent father, that he commenced to use alcohol to excess when he was as young as ten years of age and subsequently became a user of illegal substances in significant quantities. At the time of his arrest, he was a daily user of cocaine and was also consuming a very large quantity of alcohol. Currently, he had features suggestive of a significant clinical depression as well as some enduring post-traumatic symptoms. He was on anti-depressant medication.  
      
       
     14 According to the psychiatrist, Dr Samuels, the applicant seemed very motivated to use his period in gaol to turn his life around, to be substance free and to be a role model for his family.  
      
       
     15 The pre-sentence report recorded a display of remorse and contrition by the applicant. It was recorded that the applicant truly regretted his behaviour and was very emotional when talking about that, stating that he was now trying to make up for his mistakes and pay his debt to society. 
      
       
     16 The sentencing judge said that he did not regard the applicant’s previous drug and alcohol abuse as providing any mitigating circumstances, particularly in the light of the prior drug offence for which the applicant had served a prison sentence. He recorded that the applicant was entitled to the benefit of his early plea of guilty.  
      
       
     17 The sentencing judge found that the plea of guilty and other evidence, including his own sworn testimony and the evidence of the prison chaplain suggested that he was truly remorseful and determined to re-order his life, having returned for support to the religious beliefs of his youth. The applicant had assisted the authorities, undertaking to give evidence against his co-offenders. The extent of assistance warranted a discount of one third of the head sentence otherwise appropriate, taking into account the probability, as the sentencing judge found, that the applicant would have to serve his sentence in protection and that there was a possibility of danger to himself and his family in the long term. 
      
       
     18 The applicant was entitled to a 25 per cent discount or thereabouts for the utilitarian value of having pleaded guilty to the offences charged at the earliest opportunity. The applicant had given himself up voluntarily, had made full admissions immediately and had provided assistance to the authorities. Having recorded that the applicant was entitled to “the benefit of his early plea of guilty”, his Honour went on to say that, but for assistance to the authorities, he would have regarded the applicant's high degree of criminality “as calling for a head sentence of the order of nine years imprisonment”. It is apparent, therefore, his Honour took something in the order of 12 years’ imprisonment as his starting point in the sentencing process. That was for the totality of the two offences, in view of the fact that the sentencing judge then proceeded to make the two sentences identical and concurrent. 
      
       
     19 Special circumstances were found to justify an alteration in the provisional statutory formula for fixing the non-parole period. Those specified were the applicant’s genuine intention to overcome his drug and alcohol dependency and the fact that the applicant was likely to be required to serve his sentence in protection. 
      
       
     20 The sentencing judge did not specify what sentence – presumably a lesser sentence – he would have imposed in relation to each offence if committed in isolation. 
      
       
     21 The following grounds of appeal were filed with the application for leave to appeal. 
      
       
        
         
         The applicant seeks a reduction in the minimum term on the basis that the reduction in the minimum term representing 50% of the total sentence did not reflect sufficient reduction for the following factors:- 
         
        
        
         
         1. Contrition evidenced by giving a signed statement to the prosecution and agreeing to give evidence at the trial of co-offenders and the matters raised in the Affidavit of Assistance and his plea of guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The fact that because of his assistance he has been in protective custody since August 2000 and is likely to need to remain in protective custody for the balance of his term with all its attendant disadvantages. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His efforts at rehabilitation evidenced by his attendance at Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation and the evidence of Father Walsh as to his current commitment to his religious faith and his commitment to work on his emotional problems (as evidenced in the tendered psychiatric report and the tendered Probation and Parole Report and the oral evidence of his sister at the hearing, such efforts being made more substantial by a personal dependence on drugs and alcohol after a childhood of significant physical and emotional abuse). 
         
        
        
         
         4. Parity of Sentencing:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           It is submitted that insufficient weight was given to the sentences of co-offenders SUKKAR and NGUYEN who without rendering assistance to the Crown received lesser minimum terms. 
           
          
         
        
       
     22 It may be noted that these grounds of appeal were limited to the fixing of a non-parole period at 50 per cent of the sentence. I will refer to these grounds compendiously as ground 4. 
      
       
     23 At the hearing of the appeal, three new grounds of appeal were added. I will refer to them as grounds 1, 2 and 3. 
      
       
        
       1. His Honour failed to impose separate discrete sentences for each offence as required by  
       Pearce v The Queen  
       (1998) 194 CLR 610 
       . 
        
        
       2. The trial judge failed to quantify the discount allowed for early pleas of guilty, and (by implication) failed to make sufficient allowance in that regard. 
        
        
       3. The starting point for the sentence of nine years imprisonment was excessive, including reference to the sentences imposed on the applicant's co- offenders Sukkar and Nguyen. 
        
       
     24 Pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court must dismiss an appeal against sentence if it is not satisfied that a different sentence is warranted and should have been passed: Astill (No.2) 1992 64 A Crim R 289; Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 331; Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. In the last of those cases Spigelman CJ, with whom the other four members of the court agreed, said (at 720-1): 
      
       
        
         
         Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process”. That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor” is not satisfied. 
         
        
       
     25 Having regard to the objective criminality involved in the two offences and the subjective considerations to which I have referred, were I sentencing the applicant on the materials before his Honour, I would not impose sentences which amounted to an effective total sentence of less than six years with an effective non-parole period of less than three years.  
      
       
     26 My reasoning would be as follows. A starting point, sufficient to reflect the criminality involved in both offences, would be not less than the 12 years impliedly determined by the sentencing judge as the appropriate starting point. I would allow 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. I would adopt the sentencing judge's reduction of a further one third for assistance to the authorities, that not having been challenged on appeal. I would adopt the sentencing judge's finding concerning special circumstances. I would not impose a non-parole period of less than 50 per cent of the sentence. An aggregate discount of more than 50 per cent for the pleas of guilty and for assistance to the authorities would produce a result which failed to reflect the degree of criminality involved in the objective features of the two offences. The result is an effective sentence for the two offences of not less than six years with an effective non-parole period of not less than three years. 
      
       
     27 I am fortified in this view by the outcome of the Crown appeal relating to the applicant’s co-accused Mr Nguyen: Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 183. Mr Nguyen was charged with one offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. That related to the transaction of 15 October 2000 which gave rise to the first charge against the present applicant. The offence with which Mr Nguyen was charged in that regard carries the same maximum penalty as the offence of knowingly taking part in supply, being the offence with which the present applicant was charged.  
      
       
     28 In the case of Mr Nguyen, the sentencing judge took into account, on Form 1, the same offence with which the present applicant was charged, arising out of the transaction of 18 November 2000. As was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Nguyen, at [56], where an offence is to be taken into account on Form 1, the sentencing judge is required to impose a sentence that appropriately reflects the totality of the criminality of the offender. That is subject only to the maximum penalty for the offence charged. 
      
       
     29 In the result, Mr Nguyen stood for sentence in relation to offences materially identical with those for which the present applicant has been sentenced. 
      
       
     30 As to the relative degree of involvement on the part of the two men in relation to the two transactions, Mr Nguyen claimed that he was merely a front man for the true supplier of the heroin, and that he was to receive a quantity of heroin in payment, which was for his personal use as an addict. The sentencing judge said, in Mr Nguyen’s case, that he could not be satisfied that Mr Nguyen was the major player or even the source supplier, although he was a principal in the first degree and a major player. In re-sentencing, the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted that finding. Accordingly, the relative involvement of the present applicant and Mr Nguyen is to be taken as being of a very similar order. 
      
       
     31 There was a difference in the subjective considerations which arose in the present case compared with those arising in the case of Mr Nguyen. The present applicant made a clean breast of his involvement from the start, giving himself up to the police and co-operating fully with the authorities. By contrast, Mr Nguyen attempted, at first, to minimise his involvement dishonestly. On the other hand, Mr Nguyen had no relevant prior criminal history whereas the present applicant has a criminal history which involves conviction and imprisonment for the supply of a prohibited drug. In balance, the subjective aspect of the sentencing process was not markedly different as between the two cases.  
      
       
     32 In Nguyen, the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside a sentence of five and a half years with a non-parole period of two and a half years, and substituted a sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years.  
      
       
     33 What is presently relevant is that the court started, in the case of Mr Nguyen, with a head sentence of 11 years. That was a Crown appeal. Conservatively, this implied an appropriate starting point of something in the order of 12 years. Reducing such a head sentence by one third for assistance to the police in the present case and by a further 25 per cent for the early pleas, one arrives at materially the same result as that which in fact occurred in the present case. 
      
       
     34 This outcome is also consistent with the result in Petrea. He was one of the present applicant’s co-offenders. Latham DCJ found that Mr Petrea’s criminality was equal, in her view, to that of the present applicant, that of Mr Nguyen and that of another co-accused, “in the sense that they each conducted themselves as principals in the distribution of wholesale heroin, purely for commercial gain. They are, to put it another way, links of equal size and strength in the chain of distribution.” Conformably with the determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Nguyen, Latham DCJ took a sentence of 12 years imprisonment as a starting point when sentencing Mr Petrea. 
      
       
     35 In these circumstances, it is immaterial whether there was any error on the part of the sentencing judge in the present case, so far as concerns the process of reasoning which led to the effective sentence of nine years imprisonment. I will, however, briefly traverse grounds 1, 2 and 3. 
      
       
     36 As to ground 1, the Crown did not concede error on the part of the sentencing judge in not fixing a sentence for each of the two offences viewed in isolation before moving to apply the principle of totality. It was argued the two offences should properly be regarded as part of the same course of conduct and that separate treatment was, on that account, not required pursuant to the decision in Pearce. I disagree with this approach. The sentencing judge should, as asserted by the applicant, have determined a sentence for each offence in isolation. Since, however, I do not disagree with the effective sentence or with the effective non-parole period resulting from his Honour’s approach, the point is academic. 
      
       
     37 As to ground 2, the trial judge should have specified the discount allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. However, the allowance made is apparent by implication and, once recognised, is uncontroversial. 
      
       
     38 As to ground 3, the submission that the effective sentence of nine years was manifestly excessive cannot stand with the decision of this Court in Nguyen. So far as parity is concerned, Mr Sukkar received a much less severe sentence, but his role was much less involved than that of the present applicant. As for parity with Mr Nguyen’s sentence, I believe I have demonstrated that the result in the present case is entirely consistent with the sentence imposed on that co-offender on appeal. 
      
       
     39 As to ground 4, following the decision of this Court in Simpson, the Court will rarely interfere with a finding in relation to special circumstances or with the discretionary exercise of adjusting the provisional statutory relationship of the non-parole period with the sentence. In the present case, there is no basis shown for impugning what was done by the sentencing judge in that regard. 
      
       
     40 For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     41 I should take the opportunity of recording the reasons for refusal of an application for adjournment made on behalf of the applicant at the commencement of the hearing of this application for leave to appeal. 
      
       
     42 The first ground on which an adjournment was sought was that the applicant's solicitor had received the transcript of the sentencing proceedings only last Friday. There was, in the Court's view, no substance in this. The transcript was not long, and the same solicitor had appeared for the applicant on sentence as appeared on the appeal. It was not suggested that anything arose out of a reading of the transcript which needed to be done and had not been done. 
      
       
     43 The second ground was that the remarks on sentence in relation to the co-offender Sukkar were not yet to hand. This was because the application for the remarks on sentence had inadvertently been made to the wrong authority. The error had been discovered only about one week ago. Mistakes happen. Ordinarily, a litigant will not be required to suffer the consequences. However, in this instance, there was no prejudice to the applicant because it was patently clear from other materials that Mr Sukkar was not a comparable case in relation to parity of sentence . 
      
       
     44 Thirdly, the outcome of an application by the applicant for legal aid had not been notified to the applicant's solicitor. However, the content of advice by counsel on the merits of the appeal, being an advice given for the purpose of the applicant's application for legal aid, was known to the applicant’s solicitor in August, and was such as to imply that legal aid would be refused. There was, accordingly, no substance in the argument advanced that, if legal aid was refused, the applicant would wish to brief counsel privately. In practical terms, there had been the opportunity to do that. The fact that it had not been done spoke for itself. 
      
       
     45 Lastly, it was said that further evidence in relation to assistance to the authorities was likely come to hand at a future date. No evidence was adduced to show the present situation in that regard, as could have been done on a confidential basis. Again, the fact that this was not done went to the prospect that any such evidence would become available at a future time. The Court cannot wait indefinitely for such developments. In any event, the applicant was not unfairly prejudiced. If significant assistance is given to the authorities after sentence, which has not been taken into account on sentence, it is known that the executive government will entertain an application for early release and will grant such an application if warranted. 
      
       
     46 Those are the reasons for the application for adjournment having been refused. 
      
       
     47 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal granted; 
        
        
       2. Appeal dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sperling J: The applicant Ngaha Koula Tuifua applies for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by Kinchington DCJ, sitting in the District Court, Sydney, on 14 December 2001. By then, the applicant had pleaded guilty to both offences. 
      
       
     2 The first offence for which the applicant was sentenced was committed on 3 March 2000. It consisted of stealing from the person, contrary to s94 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years’ imprisonment. In relation to that offence, his Honour took into account offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and malicious damage committed in the course of the same episode.  
      
       
     3 The second offence was armed robbery, contrary to s97 of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is 20 years’ imprisonment. That offence was committed about ten days later, on 14 March 2000. His Honour took into account a further offence of goods in custody. 
      
       
     4 The sentence imposed for the first offence was a fixed term of imprisonment of two and a half years, commencing on 5 October 2000. 
      
       
     5 The sentence imposed for the second offence was imprisonment for five years, commencing on 26 October 2001, with a non-parole period of three years, commencing on the same date and expiring on 25 October 2004. 
      
       
     6 The second sentence was partly concurrent with the first. It was dated to commence about one year after the commencement of the first sentence. The combined effect of the two sentences was an effective sentence of six years and 20 days with an effective non-parole period of four years and 20 days. 
      
       
     7 The applicant seeks leave to appeal in relation to the sentences. 
      
       
     8 The applicant was 18 years of age at the time of the offences.  
      
       
     9 The applicant had a substantial criminal record dating from 1997. This included four instances of break, enter and steal and one of steal from the person, for which, compendiously, a control order of six months was imposed in May 1999, with an additional term of six months expiring on 9 May 2000. 
      
       
     10 In August 1999, an identical control order was imposed for two instances of assault with intent to rob while armed with an offensive weapon. That control order was made concurrent with the control order to which I have referred. 
      
       
     11 Meanwhile, in July 1999, the applicant was dealt with for an offence of assault. In relation to that offence, he was required to enter into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 18 months. 12 On 27 September 1999, the applicant was sentenced for breach of his recognisance to a fixed term of imprisonment of six weeks, commencing on that date. That also was concurrent with the previously-mentioned control order.  
      
       
     13 On the same date, 27 September 1999, the applicant was sentenced for the offence of possessing a prohibited drug to a fixed term of imprisonment of 14 days, commencing on that date. That sentence was, again, concurrent with the previously-mentioned control order. 
      
       
     14 Up to this point, considerable indulgence had been extended to the applicant by making the penalty for further offences concurrent. Unfortunately, he did not respond positively to that indulgence. The two offences which are the subject of the present appeal followed. They were committed while the applicant was on parole during the additional term of six months relating to the control order to which I have referred. The offences were also in breach of the applicant's recognizance to be of good behaviour, to which I have also referred. 
      
       
     15 Following the second of the two offences, that is, the offence committed on 14 March 2000, the applicant left Australia on the following day and travelled to the United States of America, where he lived with his sister. He returned to Australia voluntarily and was arrested on arrival at Sydney Airport on 5 October 2000. 
      
       
     16 On that date, a warrant for revocation of parole was executed and the applicant commenced to serve the balance of parole, being three months and three days, from 5 October 2000 to 7 January 2001. Bail was accordingly refused on 5 October 2000. 
      
       
     17 It may be noticed that the first sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ was dated from 5 October 2000, notwithstanding that the applicant was serving out the balance of parole in relation to the control order from that date until 7 January 2001. The effective sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ – consisting of the two sentences imposed by him – was thus, for practical purposes, reduced by approximately three months. 
      
       
     18 The applicant remained in custody, bail refused, until he was sentenced by Kinchington DCJ on 14 December 2001, a period in the order of 15 months. 
      
       
     19 On 28 May 2001, the applicant was committed for trial on a charge of aggravated robbery (contrary to s95 of the Crimes Act 1900) in relation to the episode which occurred on 3 March 2000. That charge was later reduced to the less serious charge of steal from the person. I will come to that. Charges in relation to the second offence were adjourned, presumably on the applicant’s motion. 
      
       
     20 The delay between October 2000 and May 2001 was not inordinate, taking into account that the applicant required that one at least of the witnesses in relation to that offence be called for cross-examination at the committal hearing. 
      
       
     21 On 8 June 2001, the charge in relation to the first episode was listed for arraignment in the District Court but was adjourned, again presumably on the applicant’s motion.  
      
       
     22 Following a further adjournment on 6 July, a trial date of 10 September 2001 was fixed for the charge of aggravated robbery then current in relation to the first episode.  
      
       
     23 Meanwhile, proceedings in the Local Court in relation to the second offence, that is, the offence in relation to the second episode, were adjourned a number of times, culminating in the applicant pleading guilty to that offence before the Local Court on 31 July 2001.  
      
       
     24 On 10 September 2001, the trial date for the charge in connection with the first episode, the applicant was indicted for the lesser offence of stealing from the person (contrary to s94 of the Crimes Act 1900). A plea of guilty was entered to that charge.  
      
       
     25 A sentencing hearing in relation to both offences was fixed for 26 October 2001. On that date, a pre-sentence report was ordered and the proceedings were adjourned to 30 November 2001.  
      
       
     26 Kinchington DCJ was not able to deal with the matter on that occasion due to ill health. The sentencing hearing was completed on 14 December 2001, and on that date the applicant was sentenced. 
      
       
     27 The applicant had not pleaded guilty in relation to any charge arising from the first episode until 10 September 2001, some 11 months after his arrest. However, that was after the initial charge, asserting a more serious offence, was reduced. The applicant should be taken to have pleaded guilty to that charge at the first available opportunity in these circumstances. 
      
       
     28 As to the charge relating to the second episode, the proceedings in the Local Court were adjourned on a number of occasions over a period of some nine months following the applicant's arrest in October 2000. Then, on 31 July 2001, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence as initially charged. There was, accordingly, some delay in that plea but the plea was entered in the Local Court before committal for trial. In these circumstances, that should also be regarded as an early plea.29 The sentencing judge’s summary of the objective features of the two offences is not impugned on appeal. Each of the episodes appears to have been triggered by a personal grudge. In each instance, the episode degenerated from verbal abuse to violence and theft. 
      
       
     30 As to the first episode, occurring on 3 March 2000, the victim was seated in his motor vehicle, parked in a street at Newport. A group of young men, including the applicant, approached the vehicle. One of them opened the door of the vehicle. The applicant and another young man in the group commenced to abuse the victim over an alleged association with the girlfriend of a member of the group. The victim denied the association. He was then punched and kicked about the head and upper body by the applicant and another man in the group. The victim tried to drive away. The ignition keys were taken from the car. The victim was again assaulted by members of the group. A demand was made for the victim’s wallet. The victim’s mobile phone was taken. The victim received injuries to his face and right arm. His back and neck were sore and he was bleeding from the ear. The mobile phone was subsequently recovered by the police from a relative of the applicant. 
      
       
     31 The Form 1 offences relating to this charge went to the violence inflicted on the victim (assault occasioning actual bodily harm) and on the victim’s motor vehicle (malicious damage). 
      
       
     32 As to the second offence, which occurred on 14 March 2000, the applicant and another man gained entry to a unit in Dee Why and confronted five males who were there. The applicant accused one of them of having sexual intercourse with his girlfriend and told them all that if they did not stay away from “the girls” the applicant would kill them all. The applicant threatened the victims with a dumbbell which he picked up. He entered the kitchen, picked up a knife and chased one of the victims into the bathroom with the knife. He then threatened another of the group with the knife, pressing it into the side of the victim’s neck. He then assaulted another one of the group, demanding his wallet. Ultimately, three mobile phones and some $25 were taken before the applicant and his companion left the premises. As he left, the applicant held his hands in the shape of two guns and said that if the victims went to the police he would shoot them all. 
      
       
     33 The Form 1 offence relating to this charge might not have been connected with the same episode. It related to possession of a stolen credit card. 
      
       
     34 As I have mentioned, the applicant fled to the United States on the following day, returning voluntarily about seven months later to give himself up. 
      
       
     35 As to subjective considerations concerning the applicant personally, the sentencing judge recorded that the applicant had a disadvantaged background, having been brought up in a home with a violent and abusive father. His Honour observed that, as at March 2000, the applicant was well on the way to becoming a full-time criminal. However, it seemed that, while residing with his sister in the United States, the applicant had determined to change his ways. The applicant had not sought to minimise the serious nature of the charges that he faced. His Honour accepted that the applicant had made giant strides towards effecting his own rehabilitation and that he was now a different person from what he was at the time of the subject offences. 
      
       
     36 His Honour noted that the applicant was on parole for a similar offence when the subject offences were committed. (As I mentioned, the offences were also in breach of the applicant's recognisance.)  
      
       
     37 The grounds of appeal are specified as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The learned sentencing judge failed to take into account or give sufficient weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The learned sentencing judge erred in giving insufficient weight to the rehabilitation of the applicant. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the delay between the date of the offence and the date of the sentencing proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The learned sentencing judge erred in the application of the principles of accumulation, concurrence and totality. 
         
        
        
         
         5. In all the circumstances, the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
         
        
       
     38 The Crown’s submissions include the submission that this Court would not be satisfied that a less severe effective sentence is warranted.  
      
       
     39 By s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court is required to dismiss an appeal against sentence unless a different sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. That is irrespective of error in the process of reasoning which brought the sentencing judge to his or her determination: Astill (No. 2) 1992 64 A Crim R 289; Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 331; Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. In the last of those cases Spigelman CJ, with whom the other four members of the court agreed, said (at 720-1): 
      
       
        
         
         Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process”. That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor” is not satisfied. 
         
        
       
     40 A sentencing guideline for armed robbery was set by this Court in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The category of case specified for the purposes of determining the guideline was specified at [162]: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
         
        
        
         
         (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) Small amount taken; 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
         
        
        
       It was said that sentences for an offence of that character should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. 
        
       
     41 In Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, it was made clear, at [161], that the category of case to which the guideline applied involved a late plea of guilty. Accordingly, any discount for an early plea of guilty was to be applied after a head sentence applying the guideline had been determined. 
      
       
     42 In Thomson and Houlton, this Court determined a guideline for the discount for an early plea of guilty. The Court said, at [160]: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant – contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value – but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount. 
         
        
        
       The Court added at [162]: 
        
        
         
         In so far as existing sentencing practice has been to allow discounts for pleas up to 35 per cent, encompassing all relevant matters, such a practice remains appropriate. 
         
        
       
     43 Obviously enough, the second offence charged (that committed on 14 March 2000) is the more serious one. It provides the appropriate starting point in my analysis. There are a number of features in common with the category of case to which the Henry guideline applies. There are then considerations which tend to make this a worse case and considerations which go the other way. 
      
       
     44 Aggravating features which tend to make this a worse case include the applicant’s very poor criminal record (Henry contemplates no or little criminal record), that the offence was committed in company as well as involving a weapon, that a number of victims were terrorised, that the applicant was on parole for the same or similar offences at the time, and that the offence was also in breach of a recognizance entered into by the applicant to be of good behaviour.  
      
       
     45 Tending the other way, there was the early plea of guilty and the applicant’s undoubted contrition for which a combined discount in the order of 30 per cent was warranted. This was also a case in which there was no serious need for specific deterrence in view of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for his actions and the commendable progress he had made in rehabilitating himself. 
      
       
     46 Were I re-sentencing the applicant on the evidence before his Honour, a head sentence for this offence, before discount for plea and contrition, could not be fixed at less than six years imprisonment. That would then be reduced to not less than four years imprisonment for the early plea and contrition.  
      
       
     47 It is then unnecessary to carry a close analysis further. It would remain to increase the sentence appropriately for the offence to be taken into account on Form 1 in relation to that charge. More importantly, it would remain to determine an appropriate sentence for the first offence charged and for the serious offences on Form 1 to be taken into account in doing so. It would then be necessary to provide for partial accumulation in a way that produced an effective sentence sufficient to reflect the total criminality involved, having regard to the objective features of the offences and subjective considerations relating to the applicant. 
      
       
     48 Carrying that exercise through could not result in an effective sentence of less than the period of six years which was the effective sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     49 The effective non-parole period determined by his Honour was two thirds of the effective sentence imposed rather than the provisional statutory proportion of three quarters. A non-parole period of less than four years would fail to reflect the degree of objective criminality involved in the totality of the offences.  
      
       
     50 For these reasons, I would not hold that different sentences were warranted in this case and should have been passed. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. 
      
       
     51 The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted and that the appeal be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of imprisonment for seven and a half years with a nonparole period of four and a half years imposed by His Honour Judge Gibson in the District Court, following the applicant's plea of guilty to one count of importing not less than a commercial quantity of, 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy). The amount involved in the offence was 1.1953 kilograms pure ecstasy, that is, more than twice the commercial quantity, and the maximum penalty for it was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $750,000. 
      
       
     2 The applicant was arrested at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport when found to be carrying, strapped to his person, two plastic bags containing in all 9,865 ecstasy tablets with a street value of approximately $690,550. The applicant declined to be interviewed when arrested and has made no subsequent disclosure in relation to the origin of the drugs or in relation to his precise role in their importation, save so far as he offered a version of facts to the author of the pre-sentence report and to Dr Carne, a consultant forensic psychiatrist. 
      
       
     3 That version, as recorded in the pre-sentence report and repeated in substance in Dr Carne's report, was to the following effect: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Niketic's description of the offence was one of opportunistic behaviour. He indicated that he was on holiday in Bali, when he was approached by a young man in a disco who suggested that he take ecstasy tablets into Australia. He stated that it seemed 'so...unbelievable and easy', and the prospect of earning $10,000 was attractive to him. Mr Niketic admits that he was not in financially dire straits at the time the offence was committed. He says that at the time he was able to explain away his behaviour, in that he was not stealing from anyone or hurting anyone. He now says that he was 'not thinking properly', and is able to articulate how some individuals might have been damaged by his behaviour. He says that he behaved 'stupidly' and that he regrets this behaviour.” 
         
        
       
     4 As the applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, the Crown has not had the opportunity to test that account, and for the reasons discussed in R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 2001 and R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, it must be given limited weight. I would add my voice to the dissatisfaction expressed in those decisions in relation to the wholly unsatisfactory practice whereby facts of relevance to an assessment of the role of an offender are sought to be proved through histories provided to third parties, which cannot then be tested. If the applicant sought to establish that his role was that of a courier, then he bore the onus of establishing that, albeit on the balance of probabilities: Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281. 
      
       
     5 I am not persuaded in those circumstances that his Honour had any choice other than to find, as he did, that it was impossible to determine what role the applicant played beyond the fact of being the person who imported the drugs. 
      
       
       Plea of guilty 
        
        
       
     6 The applicant submits, first, that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the plea of guilty, which was entered at committal. In that regard his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I take into consideration his plea as exhibiting some evidence of remorse, although he has not put any such evidence before me, other than the plea, and of course this Crown case was a very strong Crown case in relation to the matter, but I accept that it has some evidence and he is of course entitled to a discount in relation to the utilitarian value of his plea. In the particular circumstances of the case I assess [that] at fifteen percent.” 
         
        
       
     7 The error which it is said appears on the face of the record relates, first, to the absence of any reference to those portions of the report of Dr Jonathan Carne, where he noted that: 
      
       
        
       (i) the applicant ""was so ashamed of his charges that he had been unable to tell friends or family until recently""; (ii) he ""seemed ashamed"" and ""appeared remorseful about his offending""; and that 
        
       (iii) he "" 
       accepted full responsibility for his offending and was prepared to undertake whatever punishment was handed down 
       ""; 
        
       and secondly, to the absence of similar observations in the pre-sentence report to the effect that: 
        
       (i) the applicant "" 
       has found it difficult to inform his family of his whereabouts and the nature of his offence 
       ""; and 
        
       (ii)  
       ""it seems that he is deeply ashamed of his behaviour and fears their reactions 
       "". 
       
      8 Absent direct evidence from the applicant indicative of true remorse, that is, for the commission of the offence, which is quite separate from self-concern or embarrassment in relation to family, I am quite unpersuaded that his Honour fell into error or that any greater discount than that given was required in relation to the plea of guilty. 
      
       
        
       HIV status 
        
       
     9 It was next submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient consideration to the HIV status of the applicant, or to the problems which might arise in relation to his treatment while in custody, if and when, he is placed on antiretroviral therapy. In this regard his Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have read the probation report and the report in particular of Dr Stewart. Subjectively he is a man who unfortunately suffers from HIV. Now the report from the doctor would indicate that it is no longer or it is not at present active and has not been for some years, although the doctor has not seen him for some few years. It may, and probably will, although not necessarily, become active in the future and it is of course important that his condition be monitored by the authorities in relation to this matter.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     10 The only evidence in relation to this aspect of the applicant's case was that of Dr Graham Stewart, in a report which was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Alex was first referred to me in April 1999 for evaluation of known HIV infection. I saw him on three subsequent occasions, the last in November 1999. 
          
          
         Throughout that period he remained well with no symptoms attributable to HIV infection. 
          
          
         I did not start him on antiretroviral therapy as the two important blood tests used to decide when to commence this treatment (CD4+ T cell count and viral load) did not indicate a need at that time for such treatment. 
          
          
         It is likely that there has been a decrease in his immune function (as measured by CD4+ T cell count) and an increase in the amount of virus in his body (as measured by plasma viral load) in the two years since I last saw him. It is also possible that he has reached a point where it is appropriate for him to commence antiviral (sic) treatment. It is, therefore, important that he is assessed by a specialist in the field and it is my advice in this circumstance that this assessment be repeated every four months or more frequently when he gets closer to the point of commencing treatment. It is all but certain that he will eventually start such therapy and when he does monitoring of its benefits and the significant side effects will require even more close medical attention, initially with monthly assessment and, if all going well, this extending out to assessment every two months.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11 This report was not updated and there was no evidence placed before his Honour to suggest that the applicant's medical condition cannot be properly monitored and treated while he is in custody, or otherwise to suggest that the serving of a sentence by him would impose additional hardship, that is, a hardship beyond that experienced by other prisoners. 
      
       
     12 The report of Dr Stewart in fact fell well short of establishing that there had been any deterioration in the applicant's condition and it certainly did not support the submission made by the applicant, in writing, that ""as at October 2001, there was a demonstrable deterioration in the applicant's health as measured by his T cell count"". 
      
       
     13 I am not persuaded that his Honour misinterpreted the report or that he failed to give sufficient regard to the applicant's medical condition. The relevant sentencing principles in this regard are well known, being expressed, for example, in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589, R v Bailey (1988) 35 A Crim R 458, R v McDonald (1988) 38 A Crim R 470, and more recently in R v L NSWCCA 17 June 1996 where the Court observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fact that an offender suffers from an illness does not necessarily mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less than the circumstances of the case would otherwise require. It is the responsibility of the Executive to provide for the care and treatment of its prisoners: 
           
         R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351, per Street CJ at 353-4. If a prisoners' condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds, the Executive is empowered to deal with the situation. S 53 of the Sentencing Act 1989 preserves the Royal prerogative of mercy, and s 25A(1) of the Act enables the Offenders' Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or there are other 'exceptional extenuating circumstances': 
           
         R v Jones (1993) 70 A Crim R 449, per Carruthers J at 457""; 
         
        
        
       and added: 
        
        
         
         “A court cannot determine the bearing which an offender's illness might have upon sentence in the absence of adequate evidence as to the nature and extent of the illness and, where appropriate, its effect upon the conditions of the offender's incarceration. In the cases above referred to, [Smith, Bailey and McDonald] there was ample evidence of those matters. In this case there was not.” 
         
        
       
     14 It seems to me that, at its highest, the applicant's case depends upon an argument that the anxiety which would attach to his HIV status, an anxiety which I observe would exist whether he was in custody or not, would create special stresses over and beyond those attaching to an offender who is not so affected. Of that there was no evidence before his Honour, and there was no basis for his Honour to have reached the conclusion which is now advanced on behalf of the applicant. 
      
       
     15 It may be observed that for all prisoners there is a stress associated with imprisonment, and there are obvious problems, absent clear and specific evidence, in attempting any differentiation between the causes for such stressors, and the level of anxiety or the consequences attaching thereto, when pronouncing sentence. 
      
       
     16 In the light of the principles cited, and in the absence of proper evidence, I am unpersuaded that error has been shown, or that the factor of ill health was not adequately taken into account, particularly in relation to the nonparole period which was in the order of 60 per cent of the head sentence, itself well within the range suggested in R v Bernier (1998) 101 A Crim R 44. 
      
       
     17 Otherwise, the case is one in which the applicant must fail unless he can show that some sentence, other than that imposed, was warranted and should have been imposed. Having regard to the sentencing pattern in relation to ecstasy offences, and to the need for a significant element of deterrence in the sentencing of those who import such drugs, as noted in decisions such as R v Bourel NSWCCA 11 December 1998, and R v Budiman (1999) 102 A Crim R 411, I am unpersuaded that error has been shown. 
      
       
     18 I would grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal.19 HOWIE J: I agree. 
      
       
     20 SMART AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     21 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: I will ask Howie J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty before a magistrate to three charges of imposing upon the Commonwealth contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). He was committed for sentence to the District Court under the provisions of s 51A of the Justices Act (1902) and adhered to his pleas in the District Court. The maximum penalty of imprisonment that can be imposed for each offence is 2 years. 
      
       
     3 On 7 December 2001 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Freeman in respect of each charge to imprisonment for 18 months to date from the date of sentence and to expire on 6 June 2003. His Honour ordered that the applicant be released after serving 6 months upon the applicant entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 12 months. His Honour also made a reparation order in the sum of $52,599.26. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence. 
      
       
     4 Each of the offences concerned the applicant obtaining benefits to which he was not entitled from what was then the Department of Social Security. They were committed over a period from 29 March 1993 to 9 July 1998 and involved the applicant using an assumed name as well as his own. From 3 November 1983 for a number of periods of time the applicant was in receipt of benefits of various types under his own name. However, from 16 March 1993 to 20 December of that year he was also in receipt of a Job Search Allowance under the name of Paul Turner. From 21 December 1993 until 9 February 1998 he was in receipt of a Newstart Allowance also in the name of Paul Turner. 
      
       
     5 The benefits were paid to the applicant as a result of numerous false applications made by him and accompanied by supporting documentation proving this false identity. Included in this material was a statement in which he said he was living with Paul Higgins and paying him for board and lodgings. Each fortnight between March 1993 and February 1994 application forms for the payment of an allowance were sent to the applicant in the name of Paul Turner and he completed and returned them. The applicant on occasions supplied medical certificates under this name to prove that he was unfit for work. 
      
       
     6 On 23 February 1998 the applicant failed to lodge a fortnightly application form in the name of Paul Turner and no more claims or payments were made under that name from that date. However, this failure was coincidental with the fact that an ongoing investigation of the applicant’s dual claims was about to come to fruition. 
      
       
     7 As well as making fraudulent claims under the name of Paul Turner the applicant was receiving rent assistance in his own name from 2 February 1995 even though he was not entitled to that benefit because from that date he was living in a property owned by the Department of Housing. The applicant had failed to inform the relevant agency that he had moved into that accommodation, as he was obliged to do. This activity was detected and in March 1999 a debt was raised against the applicant to recover the rent assistance payments wrongfully received by the applicant. 
      
       
     8 As a result of his fraudulent activity the applicant obtained three different types of benefits, each one giving rise to a separate criminal charge. The amounts obtained were as follows: Jobsearch Allowance - $5,505.32; Newstart Allowance - $40,749.44; Rent Assistance - $6,525.40. As at 19 November 2001 $1,180.90 had been recovered by withholding benefits from the applicant. 
      
       
     9 In respect of the criminality reflected in the offences committed by the applicant, the learned sentencing judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         These impositions went on in those two separate guises over a long period, five years, and the sum involved is a not inconsiderable one. The crimes are ones which have been roundly condemned at appellate level on a number of occasions, touching as they do the whole structure of the revenue and the support network which is provided by the Government to those in need, and raising the risk that genuine claimants will be subjected to much greater difficulty in accessing benefits, and the burden borne by the ordinary taxpayer will be artificially inflated by depredations such as those in which this prisoner engaged. 
          
          
         This court is urged by authority to treat offences such as this with significant seriousness. Indeed, it is only in exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial alternative should be considered or imposed. 
         
        
       
     10 The applicant was born in 1967. He has a criminal record that dates from 1987 involving drug and dishonesty offences. Of most relevance is the fact that in 1988 he received a gaol sentence for break, enter and stealing and receiving offences. However, since that time there has been only three offences recorded against him, two of those being stealing offences one in 1989 and the other in 1998. He was fined for each of those matters. 
      
       
     11 A pre-sentence report before the sentencing judge indicated that the applicant came from a stable and reasonably happy home environment, his earlier criminal activity being blamed on associates. He resides with a partner with whom he has been in a steady relationship for the last 11 years. His work record was described as unstable and since 1988 the applicant has been in receipt of sickness or disability benefits. The applicant has been using methadone since 1988 because of his earlier addiction to heroin. 
      
       
     12 The most significant matter in the applicant’s subjective case was that he contacted the HIV virus while serving the prison sentence in 1988. There was before the sentencing judge a number of reports dealing with the state of the applicant’s health and the possible effects of imprisonment upon him. His treating doctor indicated that there were few available options for treating the applicant but there was at the time of sentence consideration being given to a new treatment regime for him. He was described as having an 86 per cent risk of his illness progressing over the next three years. The doctor indicated the difficulties of effectively treating the applicant if he were serving a prison sentence. 
      
       
     13 A report from a psychiatrist who had been treating the applicant for a period after his arrest indicated that the applicant had committed the offences because of depression resulting from his medical condition and fear of what he believed was his imminent death. The applicant said that he had used the money he obtained for heroin and in gambling to relieve his anxiety and depression. 
      
       
     14 Since his arrest the applicant had been attending the Community HIV/AIDS Team at the Redfern Community Health Centre where he has received assistance to adjust to the long-term consequences of his illness. He has also been involved in a support group providing assistance to persons suffering from HIV/AIDS. 
      
       
     15 The Probation and Parole Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report found the applicant suitable for both periodic detention and community service as an alternative to a custodial sentence. 
      
       
     16 It is clear that the state of the applicant’s health was relied upon by Mr Leask, who appeared for the applicant both before Judge Freeman and before this Court, as amounting to an exceptional circumstance that would have authorised the imposition of other than a custodial sentence. In respect of that submission his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         I note that the prisoner is already in a parlous state concerning his prognosis, and indeed the treatment apparently offered by Dr McMurchie since 1999 has not produced any major impact upon his condition or prognosis. I am prepared to infer that the prisoner's recent history of anxiety, panic attacks and the probability that he has in the past suffered from depression, will render him more likely to become depressed in jail. I accept, therefore, that this may have a deleterious effect on his physical condition. 
          
          
         This is certainly a considerable mitigating factor. It does not, in my view however, negate the other clear necessity for these offences to be met with a sentence of full-time custody. It significantly reduces the term which I would otherwise adjudge appropriate. 
         
        
       
     17 After his Honour indicated that he had considered the matters set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act and satisfied himself under s 17A of that Act that no sentence other than full-time custody was appropriate, he stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         I have considered all of the elements under s 16A, the prisoner's health foremost amongst them, his contrition, cooperation, the effect upon his family and all of those other matters, but I am also of course required, under the dictates of the CCA in El Kaharni, to consider and to reflect, in a sentence imposed upon the prisoner, the principle of general deterrence. Indeed, there are many citations to the effect that, particularly in offences of this nature, general deterrence is of very great importance. I also take into account the fact that in New South Wales there are no remissions. I propose to deal with these offences by concurrent sentences. 
          
         
        
       
     18 The applicant was taken into custody to serve the sentence imposed upon him but he was released to bail 12 days later, and has remained on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. 
      
       
     19 There are three grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to S 16G  
         Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914 
         : (lack of remissions in New South Wales); 
          
          
         2. His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the matters in s 16A Crimes Act (Commonwealth) 1914, in particular: 
          
          The plea of guilty; 
          
          The character, antecedents, means and physical or mental condition of the person; 
          
          The prospect of rehabilitation of the person; 
          
          The probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants. 
          
          
         3. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
        
       The first complaint is that his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the lack of remissions. His Honour did say that he was taking that matter into account, but the argument is that a sentence of 18 months in light of a maximum penalty of 2 years does not on its face reflect that the sentencing judge has allowed the normal discount of a third, see  
       R v El Karhani 
        (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 385. On 30 January 2002 the matter was brought back before Judge Freeman by the Crown on the basis that the sentence might be erroneous in this regard, but his Honour declined to interfere because an appeal had been lodged by the applicant. If the normal discount of a third were given to reflect the absence of remissions, a sentence of 16 months results from a maximum penalty of 2 years. 
        
       
     20 Although, generally speaking, the appropriate discount for the non-availability of remissions is a third, it is not immutably so. In Sweet (2001) 125 A Crim R 341 Spigelman CJ said, in reference to a similar submission: 
      
       
        
         
         In the present case, an experienced sentencing judge, who is well aware of the practice, departed from it in exercise of his discretion. The norm should not be treated as some sort of rule or ratio applicable on a mathematical basis. 
         
        
       
     21 But before this ground can be determined, it seems to me that regard should be paid to the sentence imposed in light of the criminality reflected in the offences for which the applicant was before the court. Even if there is error shown under this ground, this Court will not intervene where it concludes that no other lesser sentence should have been imposed. By evaluating the sentence in light of the offences committed by the applicant, the other two grounds will also be determined. 
      
       
     22 The applicant committed frauds against the Commonwealth on a regular basis over a period of more than five years and thereby obtained in excess of $50,000 of public money. Each of the three offences with which he was charged was itself made up of a large number of fraudulent acts committed by the applicant. The money was used, according to the applicant, to support a heroin addiction and for gambling. The applicant had some criminal record, although nothing of great seriousness since 1988. But of course since 1993 the applicant was constantly involved in the sustained criminal enterprise reflected in the offences for which he was sentenced. This conduct involved, to a large part, the applicant assuming another identity and supporting it by fraudulent documentation. The offences, therefore, were each a serious example of their kind, as they represented not simply three isolated acts of criminality but an ongoing course of criminal activity involving three different types of benefits obtained by the applicant. 
      
       
     23 As against the objective seriousness of these offences which clearly, for the reasons given by his Honour, had to be met by a full-time custodial sentence, the only matter the applicant could rely upon in mitigation was his poor physical ill health. This was put forward both to explain the commission of the offences and to seek leniency in the punishment imposed upon him because of the likely effect of imprisonment upon his further well being. In so far as explaining the criminal conduct, it was stated that the applicant reacted to his illness and his belief of his imminent death by seeking release in drug usage, a comfortable lifestyle and gambling. However, the applicant did not give evidence and it is not apparent why he did not resort to counselling or other assistance to come to terms with his illness as he has done after his arrest for these matters. It is in that regard that his earlier criminal lifestyle seems to assume some relevance. 
      
       
     24 His Honour accepted that imprisonment was likely to be detrimental, not only to the applicant’s physical health, but also to his mental state. But the sentencing judge concluded that, in light of the fact that the illness of the applicant existed at the time of the commission of the offences and was a motivating force behind them, this matter could not be allowed to overcome the other factors that the punishment of the applicant had to reflect. I am not persuaded that his Honour was wrong in taking that view. 
      
       
     25 On this appeal it has been argued that in light of the fact that the offences arose from the one act of misrepresentation, they were at the lower to middle range of seriousness of their type and a sentence nearing the maximum for any of the offences was manifestly excessive. In my view, that approach should be firmly rejected. It suggests that, provided that the criminal enterprise can be viewed as a continuing course of criminal conduct derived from a single false representation, an offence under the section does not become more serious by reason of the length of time over which the defrauding occurs, the amount of money involved, the number of instances in which a representation is made to the Commonwealth in order to obtain a benefit, or the number of different types of benefits received. But all of those matters will be relevant considerations in determining the objective seriousness of a particular offence. 
      
       
     26 In any event, the approach suggested does not apply in the present case. The applicant used the false identity he had created to obtain different types of benefits that required him to make different applications with different false representations. In particular, there was a clear distinction between the fraudulent conduct in obtaining rent assistance in his own name and that used to obtain benefits in the name of Paul Turner. In my view each of the offences charged against the applicant involved significant criminality and the fact that they were part of the one course of criminal conduct designed to obtain as much money from the Commonwealth as possible without coming under notice, does not mitigate their seriousness. 
      
       
     27 In this Court the applicant relies upon the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 to indicate that his Honour’s approach to sentencing the applicant was erroneous. It was submitted that Judge Freeman must have considered that the three charges represented separate and distinct criminality and determined an overall sentence to reflect that criminality. It was argued that his Honour ought to have been conscious of the overlap between the offences and should have imposed a penalty that was appropriate for a single offence. In that way, so it was submitted, his Honour would have arrived at a sentence that was more appropriate to reflect the total criminality in the three offences before him. 
      
       
     28 It seems to me that the appropriate way for his Honour to have sentenced the applicant would have been to impose slightly lesser sentences for the offences individually and then accumulated the third offence on the other two offences. In my assessment the objective criminality involved in the applicant’s offences warranted a total sentence that exceeded the maximum available for any one of them. But his Honour clearly viewed the applicant’s medical condition as a substantial mitigating circumstance, otherwise a non-parole period of six months would have been manifestly inadequate to address the objective criminality of the offences before him. 
      
       
     29 In my view the sentence imposed upon the applicant was a lenient one, over all. As the sentencing judge stated, ill health cannot be used as an excuse to commit crime, see R v L (NSWCCA, 17 June 1996, unreported) where the relevant principles are discussed. If a full-time custodial sentence were not imposed upon the applicant, the courts would be indicating that, provided a person is so ill that imprisonment would be deleterious to his well being, he can commit serious crime with impunity.  
      
       
     30 A further report of the treating doctor has been tendered on the hearing of this application and the Crown does not oppose it’s reception. The applicant is complying with the treatment which has been in progress since his release on bail and a new regime is about to be commenced which would require the applicant to obtain his medication each month under supervision of an appropriately qualified medical practitioner. His prognosis is still guarded although it has improved somewhat. The treating doctor’s report contains this final paragraph: 
      
       
        
         
         I reiterate my objection to incarceration for this man for whom the health care system (as well as the patient of course) has worked very hard to improve his health status. It would be an extraordinary waste should the hard work put in by all be threatened by the jail system which I know to move prisoners around frequently and often does not hold their health or the provision of their medication as a high priority. 
         
        
       
     31 On the appeal, a report was tendered from a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen dated 30 September 2002 which discusses the motivation for the commission of the offences by reason of the applicant’s affliction with the HIV virus. The psychiatrist indicates that the applicant would probably benefit from further counselling and the possibility of a trial of treatment with anti-depressant medication. 
      
       
     32 Unfortunately for the applicant, this Court cannot give priority to his health and well being as the medical profession is required to do. The criminal justice system has at its heart the welfare of the community generally and its protection. The courts must tailor their sentences with an eye to that overriding concern so far as common humanity will allow. In the present case this Court must attempt to safeguard the welfare agencies from fraudulent conduct of the type committed by the applicant for the benefit of those who require that support to function in the community. The scarce resources available for that purpose must be protected from those, such as the applicant, who use them for their own gratification and self-interest. The criminal courts must fulfil their role in attaining this objective and, in my view, nothing less than the sentence imposed by Judge Freeman would be appropriate to that task. 
      
       
     33 In any event, there is no evidence before this Court that the treatment regime upon which the applicant has recently entered cannot be continued while the applicant is in custody for what will be, in light of the offences committed, a relatively short period. 
      
       
     34 Although the Crown has conceded that his Honour was in error in sentencing the applicant as he did, that was an error in my view of a technical nature in this particular case, and probably in the applicant’s favour. A sentence of 18 months with an effective non-parole period of six months was well within his Honour’s discretion, however that sentence was structured. However, in light of the fact that his Honour failed in sentencing the applicant to follow, what has been described in a recent decision of this Court as a “fundamental principle”, this Court must intervene in order to re-structure the sentences. 
      
       
     35 I propose, therefore, that the application for leave be granted and the appeal allowed in relation to counts 1 and 3. The applicant should be sentenced to 6 months imprisonment from 20 September 2002. That sentence is to expire on 19 March 2003. In relation to count 2, the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months to date from 20 March 2003, but the Court should order that the applicant is to be released on that date on entering into a recognizance subject to a security of $500 and on condition that he be of good behaviour for the term of the recognizance. I would confirm the reparation order.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Woods QC in the District Court at Sydney on 15 December 2000, following his plea of guilty to 1 count of conspiracy to supply not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin. An offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine was also taken into account on a Form 1. The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for 10 years with a non parole period of 6 years and 6 months.  
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     2 At the time of the offences, the applicant was a serving police officer whose activities became the subject of investigation by the Investigation Unit, Special Crime and Internal Affairs. In the course of that investigation, his involvement with 2 co-conspirators, Ned Hammoud and Frank Moussa, in negotiations to supply heroin to a person, “Brian”, was discovered. These negotiations took place between 27 May 1999 and 16 June 1999. So far as the applicant was concerned, they involved an arrangement whereby 4 blocks of heroin, each weighing 350 grams, were ostensibly to be supplied for a price of $60,000 per block, or “Tile” as the blocks were described. The negotiations mainly took place by the use of various mobile phones, but there was also a trip to Melbourne on 13 June 1999 by the applicant and Hammoud, in the course of which there were meetings with Moussa and “Brian”.  
      
       
     3 The police investigation into this offence, and into the cocaine offence next mentioned, involved physical surveillance as well as considerable monitoring of telephone calls, and of conversations picked up by a listening device placed in a motor vehicle used by the conspirators. In the course of his involvement in the conspiracy the applicant employed a false identity in relation to the Melbourne trip, used mobile phones obtained in false names, switched SIM cards, used public telephones, and at one stage employed his policing skills to pick up the fact that the motor vehicle carrying the conspirators was the subject of surveillance.  
      
       
     4 The details of the conduct of the co-conspirators in relation to both offences are comprehensively and carefully crystallised in the statements of facts prepared by Detective Sergeant Nicholas, dated 18 November 2000 which was placed before his Honour.  
      
       
     5 The applicant was sentenced upon the basis that, so far as the heroin was concerned, the exercise was a “rip off” or ruse in which those involved would provide “Brian” with a convincing representation of being in a position to supply the drugs, and would then steal the money which “Brian” brought to Sydney to complete the purchase of at least four blocks of heroin for about $240,000, and, if necessary, to do so by force. It was not irrelevant, in that regard, that when Hammoud was arrested, he was found to be in possession of a firearm and bullet proof vest. 
      
       
     6 Although there was in fact no intention to supply, it was accepted by the applicant that the offence was made out. His Honour described it as “having the character of a major drug crime”.  
      
       
     7 The offence of being knowingly involved in the supply of cocaine did involve a genuine transaction, in so far as those involved intended to supply 16 ozs or 450 gms of this substance, to an unidentified customer of a man known as “Andreou”, at a price of $4,200 per oz. Those involved in this offence included Hammoud, Andreou, and one Richard Droubi. The details of the negotiations for the supply were picked up by police through the interception of telephone conversations, in which code words were used.  
      
       
     8 As events turned out, no cocaine was actually supplied, but as I have observed, this was accepted as having been a real transaction. His Honour also characterised this offence as a “major drug matter”, although “not as serious as the heroin matter” 
      
       
     9 His Honour appropriately observed that drug transactions of the kind here involved, require significant custodial penalties as a deterrent. That this is so is indicated by the maximum available penalties, prescribed for the two offences, which apart from the substantial fines, for which the relevant sections provide, include imprisonment for life and for 20 years respectively. 
      
       
     10 The applicant now submits that his Honour erred in characterising the heroin offence as a ”major drug crime”, and as one which was more serious than the cocaine offence; that the sentence was manifestly excessive; and that it lacks parity with that imposed upon Hammoud, who also pleaded guilty to both offences.  
      
       
        
       The proper characterisation of the heroin offence 
        
       
     11 In Regina v Kalpaxis (2001) 122 A Crim R 320, the Court was similarly concerned with an offender who offered to supply a large commercial quantity of cocaine to a purchaser, contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking 1985, without any means or intention of doing so. The case was described as “exceptional and extraordinary”, since from beginning to end it involved nothing more than a ruse by a mentally disturbed offender, who was out of touch with reality, and who was seeking to obtain sufficient money to enable him to spend time in Greece with his family, and with his father who was dying of cancer. 
      
       
     12 In the course of the reasons given for dismissing the Crown appeal against a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 2 years, Stein JA observed (with the concurrence of Studdert J and myself) at 322: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In written submissions the appellant is critical of his Honour for describing the true character of the offence as more akin to obtaining money by a false pretence. It is submitted that his Honour made an erroneous classification of the offence and that this led him to impose a sentence which was far too short and to exercise his discretion to direct that the execution of the sentence be suspended. In my view, what his Honour said was no more than a comment which, with respect, was appropriate.” 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour continued (at 323): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The offence itself must be seen as falling at the least serious end of the spectrum encompassed by the breadth of the provision and the definition of supply in s 3. It needs to be emphasised again that there was no actual supply nor any intention or ability to supply drugs.  
         
        
        
         
         There is, it seems to me, an argument that offences of this nature, which apparently occur infrequently, ought to be dealt with by a separate section of the legislation which can have as its maximum penalty a different penalty than life imprisonment.” 
         
        
       
     14 Kalpaxis was a very different case from the present in so far as the “transaction” there involved a single offender who was mentally disturbed, whose motivation was limited, and who had no realistic prospect of success in what was an extremely amateur venture.  
      
       
     15 The present case was far more serious since those involved behaved in an organised and systematic way, entirely consistent with that employed by those involved in high level drug dealing, as part of a plan to secure a substantial sum of money from another person, who was also involved in that trade. While this offence might also have had the flavour of an attempt or a conspiracy to obtain money by deception or by a false pretence, to so characterise it would, in my view, inappropriately minimise the criminality involved. 
      
       
     16 It is regrettably a fact of life, within the organised drug trade, that “rip offs” occur, and those who choose to cloak such an endeavour with the appearance of a genuine drug deal, must accept the consequences if their conduct happens to fall within the specific provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  That this is the case is indicated by the decisions of this Court in R v Dessdic and Mazzeo (1987) 34 A Crim R 40, R v Addison (1993) 70 A Crim R 213 and R v Salem NSWCCA 3 October 1997, each of which confirmed that the relevant mens rea was that relating to the agreement or conspiracy to make an offer to supply which would be regarded by the offeree as genuine, rather than an intention to perform it.  
      
       
     17 Part of the reason for that lies in the circumstance that, unlike most cases of fraud or false pretences, the victim of a drug rip off is unlikely to report the matter to police. As a result, subject to any act of violent retribution, which commonly follows such an event, the offender is likely to escape scot-free. 
      
       
     18 There is a significant community interest in not allowing the drug trade to be used as a vehicle for fraudulent activities of this kind, and also in deterring the kind of violent response which such conduct can very readily provoke.  
      
       
     19 It may be accepted that the criminality involved in such a case is somewhat less than that involved in a case where there was a genuine plan to supply drugs. It may also be accepted, as Kalpaxis suggests, that there would be merit in creating a specific offence with a lesser penalty than life imprisonment for conduct of the kind here involved. 
      
       
     20 However it does not follow, in my view, that conduct of the organised and elaborate kind seen in this case should be seen to involve an objective criminality comparable to that observed in a routine case of false pretences, or in one of obtaining money by deception, punishable by reference to the maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment applicable, for example, to cases falling within ss 178BA, 178BB, and 179 Crimes Act 1900. Kalpaxis does not stand as authority for such a proposition, nor did it suggest an appropriate range of penalty for a case such as the present.  
      
       
     21 While it may not have been strictly appropriate to refer to the present heroin offence as a “drug offence”, such a label is understandable if taken to be a shorthand way of referring to an offence which comes within the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act by reason of the combined effect of ss 25 and 26 of the Act. Having regard to the agreed statement of facts and the terms of the intercepted conversations, it was, on any fair view, a particularly serious offence which could have secured a substantial sum of money.  
      
       
     22 I am not persuaded that his Honour, by the comments in question, led himself into error by overstating the objective criminality involved. Even if it did have that effect, such an error would not necessarily justify intervention by this Court since the success or otherwise of this appeal depends on the other grounds relied upon, and in particular, upon the question whether some sentence other than that imposed should have been passed for the offence.  
      
       
        
       Parity of sentence and excessiveness of sentence 
        
       
     23 These grounds overlap to a considerable degree. There is no obligation to follow the principle of parity, where that would result in a sentence which would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: R v Draper NSWCCA 12 December 1986, and R v Diamond NSWCCA 18 February 1993; and R v Hopper NSWCCA 19 November 1998; or where the differences between the offenders justifies the different result: R v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83 and R v Reid [2000] NSWCCA 166. 
      
       
     24 Otherwise, there are observations in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 (per Mason J) at 613-614 and per Dawson J (with whom Wilson J agreed at 623) which provide support for the proposition that the Court may have to intervene, where the disparity leads to a legitimate sense of grievance, even though it recognises that by doing so, the substituted sentence is less than that which it otherwise considers appropriate. The Court will not do so, however, where the sentence passed upon the co-offender is inadequate to the point where any sense of grievance engendered by it can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one.  
      
       
     25 Hammoud, it may be observed, was sentenced by Woods DCJ, on 15 December 1999 for the same offences, along with some unrelated offences, to imprisonment for 5 years for the heroin offence, divided equally between minimum and additional terms of 2 ½ years each, and to a concurrent fixed term of 2 years for the cocaine offence.  
      
       
     26 On 15 December 2000, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Regina v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540) allowed a Crown appeal against the leniency of these sentences. As a consequence, Hammoud was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years for the cocaine offence, and to imprisonment for 5 years for the heroin offence, the latter sentence being partially cumulative, so far as it was directed to commence 2 years after the commencement of the sentence for the cocaine offence. Against the overall sentence of 7 years, a non parole period was fixed of 4 ½ years. The judgment of the Court was available to his Honour Judge Woods when he came to sentence the present applicant, and it was expressly taken into account.  
      
       
     27 In relation to the cocaine offence, the co-offender Andreou was sentenced by his Honour Judge Dodd, on 16 March 2000, following his plea of guilty in the Local Court to an offence of conspiracy to supply, to imprisonment for 2 years with a minimum term of 12 months. The other offender Droubi, who was convicted after trial, in relation to his participation in the cocaine offence, was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non parole period of 4 years, which was reduced on appeal (R v Droubi [2002] NSWCCA 269) to imprisonment for 5 years with a non parole period of 3 years and 3 months.  
      
       
     28 It is accepted that there were relevant differences between Hammoud and the applicant which need to be taken into account when determining, whether viewed objectively, the applicant is entitled to assert that he is left with a “legitimate sense of grievance” as the relevant test has been enunciated by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen , Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 71 ALJR 875 and Regina v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251. 
      
       
     29 Those factors operating in favour of the applicant were as follows: 
      
       
     a) Hammoud had prior convictions, including a conviction for violence. The applicant had no prior convictions. 
      
       
     b) Hammoud, who also pleaded guilty was sentenced upon the basis that there had been an intention to actually supply the heroin, whereas the applicant was sentenced upon the opposite basis. 
      
       
     c) In Hammoud’s case, the quantity involved was 15 blocks of heroin, whereas in the applicant’s case, it was agreed to be 4 blocks. 
      
       
     d) In Hammoud’s case there was a significant mitigation of sentence involved as a result of his plea, the assistance which he had given to police both in terms of the supply of information and undertakings to give evidence against his co-accused, not only in relation to the present offences, but also in relation to other offences, including those of murder, 2 accessory after the fact charges, and the cocaine and heroin charges. In the applicant’s case the plea came later, and while there was a belated supply of information, its value had not been ascertained by the time he appeared for sentence. Moreover, his plea came at a time when it was known that his co-conspirators were prepared to give evidence against him.  
      
       
     e) The cocaine offence was preferred as a separate count in the case of Hammoud, whereas it was taken into account on a Form 1 in the applicant’s case.  
      
       
     f) In Hammoud’s case there was no suggestion of the existence of any mental state which may have explained or minimised his criminality. In the applicant’s case there was evidence of him having suffered from some upheavals in his personal and professional life, which had left him significantly depressed and psychologically fragile.  
      
       
     g) Hammoud was on bail at the time of the offences. 
      
       
     h) Hammoud was in possession of an unlicensed firearm.  
      
       
     30 Those factors operating adversely to the applicant in relation to parity, in summary, were as follows: 
      
       
     a) Hammoud was a civilian, whereas the applicant was a police officer who had betrayed his sworn duty, in crossing the line into a serious area of criminality, and who had deliberately taken advantage of the special training which he had received in undercover activities, to avoid detection. 
      
       
     b) His plea of guilty was offered on 24 July 2000, the date fixed for trial, some 4 months after Hammoud had been sentenced. 
      
       
     c) The information which the applicant had provided to police had been provided only shortly before appearing for sentence, and as a consequence it had not then, and seemingly has not now, been evaluated. 
      
       
     d) So far as the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon Hammoud are to be regarded as providing some indication of an appropriate range for the objective criminality involved (after adjustment for the subjective considerations), it needs to be appreciated that they were significantly less than those properly imposed at first instance, because of the principle of double jeopardy – a circumstance made specifically clear by Mason P in his reasons for judgment.  
      
       
     31 As between Andreou and the applicant there were also material differences, in that: 
      
       
     a) Andreou was a civilian, whereas the applicant was a serving police officer, 
      
       
     b) Andreou was given a substantial discount for assistance and for his undertaking to give evidence against the co-accused, as well as in relation to unassociated matters, and additionally, for deferring his application for bail in order to assist the prosecution in its application to have the present applicant’s bail revoked, as a result of which the sentence, otherwise regarded as appropriate, of imprisonment for 4 years, was reduced by 50%. 
      
       
     c) Andreou’s plea was offered in the Local Court at the first available opportunity. 
      
       
     d) Andreou’s objective criminality was assessed as being of a minor character, in a drug supply operation, which his Honour found was conducted by the present applicant. 
      
       
     e) When sentencing Andreou, Dodd DCJ had regard, for parity purposes, to the sentence originally imposed by Woods DCJ on Hammoud, the Crown appeal not having come on for hearing at that stage. 
      
       
     f) Andreou had a drug habit and engaged in the enterprise, in part, for the purpose of feeding that habit, whereas the applicant’s motivation was purely financial. 
      
       
        
        g) Andreou was found to have had significantly favourable subjective circumstances and to have demonstrated good prospects for rehabilitation. 
        
       
     32 In relation to the Droubi sentence, there were also significant differences in that: 
      
       
        
       a) Again, Droubi was a civilian, 
        
       b) His involvement in relation to the cocaine offence concerned only 4 ozs, that is, a quantity less than the commercial quantity which was involved in the applicant’s offence, and he was accordingly being sentenced for an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years, 
        
       c) He was sentenced for the cocaine offence after trial, having earlier pleaded guilty to 2 minor supply offences, and having also asked for a Form 1 offence to be taken into account. 
        
       d) The sentence imposed was reduced on appeal by reason of the very favourable subjective circumstances which were found to exist.  
        
       
     33 The subjective circumstances of the applicant, as found by his Honour, require a little more amplification since they are relevant to the issue of parity, and to the issue whether the sentence as a whole is excessive. The applicant, who was of Lebanese descent and aged 30 years at the time of the offence, had been a police officer for about 10 years. While serving as a uniformed constable at Bankstown, he had been the subject of a degree of racial harassment from fellow police, as well as abuse and death threats from sections of the Lebanese community, whom, he had cause to deal with in the course of his work. In 1993, he had been involved in shooting an offender in self defence, and he had also been required to respond to some other incidents where he had to deal with violent confrontations.  
      
       
     34 He became the subject of internal police investigations following complaints from various citizens, and from a fellow officer who suggested that she had been intimidated by him. Most of these complaints came to nothing, but the investigation was prolonged and the applicant came to feel disillusioned by the job and by what he regarded as a lack of support.  
      
       
     35 In about 1997 his marriage fell apart, and in about 1999 a new relationship similarly terminated when his partner became dissatisfied at being herself caught up in the investigation of a complaint made against him for the alleged inappropriate use of travel benefits. 
      
       
     36 Although he came from a large and supportive family, there was evidence that by 1998 he had been demonstrating a change in mood and personality, to the point where his mental and physical health were compromised, and where he was unable to properly communicate with his parents or siblings. As a result he was off work on sick leave or annual leave between 23 February 1999 until the time of his arrest, after which he was suspended from duty. In October 2000 his resignation from the Police Service was accepted.  
      
       
     37 The emergence of some of the manifestations of his depression and mental fragility, it was found, coincided with his involvement with the criminal associates whom he joined in the present offences. That fact, his Honour found, had not been revealed to Dr Wilcox, the psychiatrist whose reports were tendered in the sentencing proceedings. 
      
       
     38 While his Honour accepted that this circumstance reduced the mitigating impact which his mental state had, it did not entirely destroy it. Nevertheless, he found, and it is difficult to see how such a finding could be questioned, that his mental state did not provide a full explanation for the misconduct and for which he had to take responsibility.  
      
       
     39 As a police officer sworn to observe and enforce the law, he could not properly rely on mental pressures to excuse his election to cross to the other side of the road and become a criminal. Particularly is that so when it is appreciated that medical help was provided to him, in the form of consultations and supportive counselling commencing in March 1999 which was arranged by the New South Wales Police Service Health and Workplace Services for a condition, which was initially diagnosed as an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, as well as psychiatric consultation with Dr Wilcox, to whom he was first referred by his General Practitioner in June 1999. 
      
       
     40 So far as the psychologist and psychiatrist were concerned, his problems were all service related, particularly arising out of the various internal investigations. It appears from Dr Wilcox’s report of 27 July 1999, that those investigations had by then been resolved and that he was free thereafter to return to duty, although subject to work appraisal for 12 months.  
      
       
     41 Dr Wilcox’s report of 8 March 2000 suggests that there had been a significant deterioration in his mental state after he had been taken into custody. By the time of her review in October 2000, however, his condition had improved substantially. It was Dr Wilcox’s assessment at this time, although that was not entirely supported by a report from a consulting psychologist prepared at the same time, that he had recovered from his depression, and due to having developed a stronger connection with his faith he was a lot calmer.  
      
       
     42 I am not persuaded, having regard to the significant differences between the applicant and both Andreou and Droubi mentioned, and having regard to the fact that the cocaine offence was dealt with in the applicant’ case on a Form 1, that any real assistance is gained by reference to the sentence in either of those matters. 
      
       
     43 It may be accepted that it was proper for his Honour to reflect the significant criminality involved in the cocaine offence by some addition to the sentence imposed for the heroin offence. The fact of such addition should have been apparent, in order to reflect the totality of the criminality involved, although in accordance with principle any additional punishment imposed should have been less than that which would have been imposed had that offence been separately charged: Regina v Lemene (1999) 118 A Crim R 131 and Regina v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 332.  
      
       
     44 Upon that basis, the partial accumulation of sentence, as a result of the appeal in Hammoud’s case, has some relevance, as do the circumstances that Hammoud was dealt with upon the basis of a genuine intention to supply the heroin, that the quantity involved so far as he was concerned was greater, that he had criminal antecedents of some significance, that he had been on bail at the time of the offence, that he was not suffering from any mental condition which may have reduced his criminality, and that he would not necessarily face the same difficulties in custody as the applicant would, by reason of his former occupation. 
      
       
     45 The question for determination, so far as parity is concerned, turns essentially upon whether or not the circumstances that Hammoud’s plea was early, that he provided very considerable assistance, and that the applicant’s offence involved a deliberate and substantial betrayal of trust, sufficiently account for the difference in sentencing outcomes of 10 years with a non parole period of 6 ½ years in the applicants case, and of 7 years with a non parole period of 4 ½ years in Hammoud’s case, to the point where, viewed objectively, no sense of grievance could legitimately be entertained. 
      
       
     46 Otherwise, the question which arises is whether, viewed as a whole, and taking into account the applicant’s subjective circumstances and prior good character, which cannot be entirely ignored for the reasons outlined in Ryan v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR, the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive and, as such, was not one which was just and appropriate for the case.  
      
       
     47 The matters for determination are very much a matter of impression. The simple fact of differences in outcome between the two sentences is of itself insufficient to establish that degree of a sense of grievance, as will enliven the Court’s discretion to intervene: Regina v Diamond NSWCCA 18 February 1993. Moreover the applicant’s case is somewhat unusual so far as his participation in the heroin offence was dealt with upon a different factual basis, and in circumstances where no comparable case has been identified, from which a benchmark can be usefully drawn. 
      
       
     48 Of greatest concern is the circumstance that the applicant was a serving police officer who, despite his earlier good character and apparent devotion to duty, had lent himself to very serious criminal activities, the potential consequences of which should have been starkly obvious to him. Moreover, he not only used, but shared with his associates, the specialist skills which he had acquired in an undercover officers course, in an attempt to avoid detection. As such, the case was one calling for a very significant element of general and personal deterrence, particularly as experience regrettably shows, the potential for police to behave corruptly in relation to drug dealing activities and drug law enforcement, is significant.  
      
       
     49 While some mitigation can be extended for the applicant’s mental state, in accordance with the principle noted in Regina v Letteri NSWCCA 18 March 1992, and Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, the extent of such mitigation is lessened by the circumstance that, at least in part, the stresses and depression which he experienced were attributable to his own misconduct.  
      
       
     50 In my view, a weighing of the various factors outlined does lead to the conclusion that there was a degree of disparity, and some excessiveness of sentence to the point, where this Court should intervene, although not to the full extent suggested by Mr Odgers SC for the applicant, whose submission, in substance, was that for the “heroin offences” standing alone, an appropriate head sentence would have been one in the order of imprisonment for 4 years, which might fairly be increased by 2 years to allow for the Form 1 matter.  
      
       
     51 It was the initial Crown submission that the range for the kind of offence committed by the applicant, involving a substantial and well executed “rip off”, within the context of persons engaged actively in the drug trade, should be in the order of 10 to 12 years for the head sentence, before reference to the subjective circumstances. In the case of a police officer who had abused his trust, and who had turned the special skills acquired through his training and service to his advantage, the Crown submitted, it should be somewhat higher. These submissions were later withdrawn, when further research revealed no cases with sufficiently comparable factual circumstances, or any discernible sentencing pattern.  
      
       
     52 Those cases with the greatest similarity were Dendic & Mazzeo, Addison, and Salem. In Dendic the sentences of 3 years were said to be modest in relation to circumstances considerably less serious than those in the present case. 
      
       
     53 The withdrawal of that submission was, in my view, both fair and appropriate, having regard to the Judicial Commission statistics which would suggest that head sentences of 12 years for all offenders as well as for those who plead guilty, in relation to offences of supplying and knowingly being involved in the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin would be at the top of the range, although well within range for offences of conspiracy to supply such a quantity of heroin. There is a significant and, on first impression, surprising difference in relation to the latter offence (both for all offenders and for those who pleaded guilty) since the statistics show that 72% of the offenders received head sentences in excess of 12 years. That is, however, almost certainly due to the small population of cases encompassed, and to the wide divergence in objective and subjective circumstances which bare statistics can conceal.  
      
       
     54 In lieu of the original submission the Crown submitted that, by reason of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s criminality, particularly when regard was had to the offence on the Form 1, the sentence had not been shown to have been manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     55 In my view, the head sentence in a case involving an elaborate and well planned rip off of the kind here involved, carried out within the context of persons actually involved in the drug trade, and involving a significant quantity of drugs, would be in the order of 5 to 6 years. However, in the particular facts of this case, where there was a serious drug offence taken into account on a Form 1, and where the offender had seriously abused his position as a police officer, the appropriate head sentence should, in my view, have been somewhat higher.  
      
       
     56 After proper allowance for the degree of disparity and excessiveness which I find to have existed, and taking into account the subjective circumstances I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
     1. Leave to appeal granted; 
      
       
     2. Sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof, taking into account the Form 1 offence and the plea of guilty, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months to date from 15 December 1999 and to expire on 14 June 2007.  
      
       
     3. Non parole period of 5 years be set, to commence from 15 December 1999 and to expire on 14 December 2004. 
      
       
     57 I would not be minded to depart from the finding of special circumstances even though it appears that the applicant elected, as from 15 April 2002, to go off protection and is now detained at Cooma Correctional Centre in a way which is no different from that of the general inmate population. That may prove to be a temporary situation, since as a former Police Officer, he will always be potentially vulnerable while in custody and may well face problems at another centre. Otherwise, I am satisfied that there is a need for long term supervision on parole after his release, so as to deal with any residual mental state associated with his imprisonment and the loss of an otherwise worthwhile career, and so as to foster his rehabilitation. These matters constitute special circumstances within the meaning of the Act.  
      
       
     58 SMART AJ: I agree.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 June 2002 the offender was indicted on a charge that on 6 April 2001 at Liverpool he did murder Benjamin Skye Hillier. He pleaded not guilty but on 10 July 2002 a jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder and the offender is now to be sentenced for that offence. 
     
      
    2 The evidence before the jury was of a relatively short compass and the dispute between the Crown and the offender was a narrow one. There were a number of issues raised for the jury’s consideration by reason of the intoxicated state of the offender at the time of the commission of the offence and the circumstances leading up to the killing of the deceased. However, the jury’s verdict, in my view, has the result that there is now little dispute as to the facts they must have found in order to arrive at the decision that the offender was guilty of murder. That is because I believe that had the jury found that the version given by the offender was possibly true, they could not have convicted him of that offence. Accordingly, there is little need for me to determine the facts for the purposes of sentencing the offender. 
     
      
    3 On the evening preceding the shooting the offender had been drinking alcohol at the Collingwood Hotel, Liverpool. During the evening he became friendly with a number of persons earlier unknown to him including Mr Fabian, a witness who gave evidence at the trial. In the early hours of 6 April his brother, Paul Katar, joined the offender at the hotel. By about 2 am, when the deceased and the offender first came into conflict, the offender was heavily intoxicated. He later told police that he had drunk somewhere between 10 to 20 drinks of Bourbon and coke. Another witness, who had been in his company through the evening, indicated that the number of drinks consumed by the offender was between 15 and 20. 
     
      
    4 The deceased was also drinking at the hotel, having gone there after he had completed work. He was in the company of his brother who had been at the hotel for some hours and was well intoxicated at the time of the incidents that gave rise to the killing of the deceased. Also present at the hotel was the deceased’s aunty, Ms Vicki Buggy. At some stage Ms Buggy walked through the public bar and passed the table where the offender and his group were sitting. The offender had been making comments to his companions about females as they passed by. On this occasion he made some comment of an indecent nature concerning Ms Buggy. 
     
      
    5 The deceased became aware of this incident and took offence. He confronted the offender and his group in the public bar and berated them for their conduct. During the course of his haranguing of the offender, he threatened violence to both him and members of his group. However, the deceased’s fury subsided and he made some remark that the intoxicated state of the offender was probably the cause of his bad behaviour. There was evidence that towards the end of this confrontation the deceased had attempted to shake the offender’s hands but the offender had declined the offer. 
     
      
    6 This incident passed without any actual violence being used by any of the persons involved. The deceased then rejoined his brother and the offender left the hotel for a short period. 
     
      
    7 When the offender returned to the hotel he went with his brother into the gaming room as the public bar had closed. They sat talking to each other against one of the walls of the gaming room about the earlier incident when again the deceased approached them. For some reason his anger with the offender had been reignited. The deceased violently pushed the offender or head-butted him against the hotel wall. Further violence between the two was avoided when bouncers intervened and restrained the deceased. The offender then left the hotel. 
     
      
    8 The most significant dispute in the trial concerned what happened thereafter. An important witness in the Crown case was one of the bouncers at the hotel, Mr Siofele. His account was as follows. As the offender left through the hotel door into the car park, he made a beckoning signal with his hand towards the deceased who, when he had finished his drink, followed the offender outside into the car park. Mr Siofele immediately followed the deceased out of the hotel sensing that there may be more trouble between the two. When he got outside he saw the offender at the corner of the hotel near the Hume Highway again beckon to the deceased. He also heard the offender whistle to attract the deceased’s attention. The offender then disappeared around the corner. The deceased walked toward the corner of the hotel where the offender had been and when he reached that spot, there were three shots fired one after the other. The deceased doubled over, holding his stomach. 
     
      
    9 The deceased then returned to the public bar inside the hotel and collapsed to the floor. Despite attempts by persons then present to assist him, the deceased was mortally wounded and he died before arriving at the hospital. 
     
      
    10 The offender strenuously disputed the account given by Mr Siofele. It was put to the witness by his counsel that his evidence of seeing the offender beckon to the deceased both at the door of the hotel and at the corner of the car park was untrue and had been fabricated by him. It was also put to him that he had made up his evidence of hearing a whistle from the corner of the hotel as he had never given this account before. 
     
      
    11 The offender’s version given both to the police and in evidence at the trial was that, after he was assaulted by the deceased in the gaming room, he decided to walk to his home a short distance from the hotel. This was despite the fact that he had driven his brother’s motor vehicle to the hotel and that his brother had ridden a motorbike there intending to exchange the bike for the motor vehicle. The offender’s version was that after he rounded the corner of the hotel and walked down the Hume Highway for a short distance toward his home, he realised that his brother was not with him and was still at the hotel. Being concerned for his brother’s safety, he turned around to return to the hotel. He was then suddenly confronted by the deceased a few paces from the corner of the hotel. The offender said that he then drew from his waist belt a loaded revolver, which he had purchased earlier that night. At the same time he told the deceased to, “Fuck off”. 
     
      
    12 The offender’s evidence was that he was holding the weapon at about waist height, pointed across his body and towards the ground. The deceased then lunged towards him with his arms outstretched. The offender moved backwards and, at the same time, he flinched causing the gun to discharge. He told both the police and the jury that he did not mean to shoot the weapon and certainly had no intention of using it to injure the deceased. 
     
      
    13 Three shots were fired each of which struck the deceased in the torso. One of the bullets entered the deceased’s back and penetrated his heart causing his death. Neither of the other two shots were life threatening, one passing through the deceased’s genital area and the other entered his shoulder lodging beneath the opposite armpit. 
     
      
    14 Dr Little who performed the autopsy on the deceased was unable to indicate the order in which the three injuries were inflicted. However, it seems to me that the most likely scenario is that the first shot fired was that which entered the front of the deceased in the area of his genitals and that the other two shots were fired rapidly thereafter, entering the deceased’s body as he turned away from the offender and crouched over as a result of the first injury. If this is so it is likely that it was the third shot fired that killed the deceased. 
     
      
    15 On the version given by the offender, the issue arose as to whether the discharge of the revolver was a voluntary act. Clearly by finding the offender guilty of murder, the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he deliberately discharged the revolver. In light of the fact that the offender intentionally presented a loaded weapon towards the deceased and that three shots were fired from the weapon into his body, the jury’s finding is unsurprising. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately pulled the trigger on each of the three occasions that the weapon discharged. 
     
      
    16 The substantial issues raised for the jury’s determination were whether it was reasonably possible that the offender discharged the weapon in self-defence and, if not, was it reasonably possible that he was provoked by the conduct of the deceased to the degree which would justify a verdict of manslaughter. By its verdict, the jury must have determined both of those issues adversely to the offender. In my view that was the only finding reasonably open to the jury on the evidence before them. 
     
      
    17 The offender told both the police and the jury that he had come into possession of the revolver for the first time earlier that evening at the hotel. He maintained that he had purchased it for $350 from a person whom he had met that evening. He said that he obtained the weapon because he knew someone who lived on a farm, who had indicated that he wished to obtain a gun and to whom the offender owed a number of favours. The offender told the jury that he knew, when he purchased the weapon, that it was loaded as he had seen bullets in the chamber but he was not aware if it had an operative safety catch. 
     
      
    18 This unlikely version became incredible when the offender explained what he then did with the weapon. Notwithstanding that on his account he had purchased the revolver in the car park in close proximity to the vehicle he had driven there, he said that he placed the loaded weapon into the front waistband of his trousers as he re-entered the hotel after completing the purchase. There the weapon remained throughout the rest of the evening including the time when the offender was engaged in playing pool. He said that he never told anybody, not even his brother, that he had the gun. 
     
      
    19 I have no doubt that the jury rejected this account of how he obtained possession of the firearm on this evening. This is not only because in my view it is inherently unbelievable. The offender was also inconsistent in the account that he had given to the jury on the one hand and the police on the other as to when and where it was that he purchased the weapon at the hotel. I am confirmed in this view because the offender has given a further, and again inconsistent, account about obtaining the weapon to a psychiatrist who prepared a report for the sentencing proceedings. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender came into possession of the firearm sometime after the first confrontation with the deceased in the hotel. I am unable to determine the circumstances in which he did so, but I have no doubt that he obtained it believing that it might be necessary to use the weapon against the deceased. 
     
      
    20 I also have no doubt that the jury rejected the totality of the offender’s version of how the deceased was shot. If they had believed that there was a reasonable possibility he was acting in self–defence, then they would have convicted him of manslaughter. But in any event, I accept the evidence given by Mr Siofele as being honest and accurate not only by reason of my assessment of him as a witness but also because his account is supported to an extent by other witnesses in the Crown case. In my view, contrary to the account given by the offender, the evidence proved overwhelming that the deceased was shot immediately he reached the corner of the hotel and without going around it. 
     
      
    21 A witness who was outside a shop on the Hume Highway a short distance from where the shooting took place and in a perfect position to see what occurred gave evidence of the confrontation between the offender and the deceased. This was Mr Harries. Although he was a reluctant witness and his demeanour would hardly have impressed the jury, I have no doubt that his version was substantially correct. He said that he saw the offender go around the corner of the hotel and then turned to face the entrance of the hotel car park. At that time he was holding a gun. Mr Harries was adamant that, when the deceased arrived at the corner of the hotel, he immediately turned to move away from the deceased and, as he did so, he was shot. That version is entirely consistent with the account given by Mr Siofele and entirely inconsistent with that given by the offender. It is also consistent with the injuries sustained by the deceased. 
     
      
    22 The evidence of Mr Fabian, the offender’s drinking companion on the evening was to the same effect: the deceased was shot almost immediately he arrived at the corner of the hotel without moving around the corner and out of sight. 
     
      
    23 Further, the offender’s brother told the jury that when the offender arrived home from the hotel, he was a “bit irate” and was saying “Fuck him” and “Fuck him he shouldn’t have fucked with me”. The offender’s attitude at this time is hardly consistent with the account that he later gave of pulling out the weapon acting in fear for his personal safety and the weapon accidentally discharging. 
     
      
    24 There is also evidence that suggests that something was said or done that caused the deceased to follow the offender out of the hotel and up towards the corner. Mr Fabian said that as the deceased approached him in the driveway, the deceased said, “Where is he? Does he want [a] go?” 
     
      
    25 In my view, the evidence indicates that, rather than acting in self-defence, the offender lured the deceased to the spot where he waited in ambush to shoot him. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately fired three shots into the body of the deceased. In those circumstances and notwithstanding his intoxicated state, I have no doubt that he fired the gun with the intention of killing the deceased. It is thus a serious case of premeditated murder. 
     
      
    26 It is apparent, from a question asked by the jury after their retirement, that one of the jurors was concerned as to whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was not acting under provocation. Although I left provocation to the jury, I would have been appalled had a verdict of manslaughter been returned on that basis. I accept that the deceased’s conduct towards the offender was an over-reaction and completely unjustified by any misconduct of the offender. But surely we have not reached the stage in this society, that the deceased’s conduct would justify a loss of control such that an ordinary member of this community would form an intention to kill or seriously injure him. If the jury had found the offender guilty of manslaughter by reason of provocation, it would have been a damning indictment of the community’s attitude to the use of violence in general and firearms in particular. 
     
      
    27 Although I have been involved in the criminal law for most of my professional life, I still find it extraordinary that a 33-year old man of no relevant convictions could have believed that in any way he was justified in obtaining a loaded firearm and discharging it at close range to the deceased having lured him into a position where he could carry out that act. There is nothing in the reports, which have been tendered, that even vaguely suggests why the offender acted as he did. I find it difficult to believe that it was merely the result of his intoxicated state or that he was unusually concerned about injury to his face or head. He appears to be not normally a violent person and would be likely to avoid conflicts. I accept that the deceased was the aggressor on this particular night and used his height and weight advantage to intimidate the offender and his companions. 
     
      
    28 However, the offence, in my view, requires that very severe punishment be imposed upon the offender notwithstanding his lack of earlier relevant criminal record and the fact that the deceased was to a greater extent responsible for the violence that resulted in his needless death. The sentence to be imposed upon the offender must denounce the use of violence in public, particularly where it involves a loaded firearm, and it must attempt to deter other persons who feel offended by the conduct of others from taking action of a similar nature in retribution or revenge. 
     
      
    29 As I have already indicated there is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the offender that can mitigate the offence. Although he had an unfortunate early life, and witnessed the suicide of his step-father, he was able to overcome such an experience and lead a relatively honest and worthwhile life. He had a close relationship with his mother and still enjoys her support and that of her present husband. The offender has generally been in employment of a manual or physical kind and has been only in receipt of unemployment benefits for two or three months of his life. 
     
      
    30 He is generally speaking in sound physical and mental health. However, he accepts that at times he has drunk alcohol to excess as he did on the night of the shooting. He has been involved in two long-term relationships, the most recent of which was on foot at the time of the offence. His partner is prepared at the present time to try to maintain the relationship and live with the offender on his release from prison. She visits him weekly in gaol. 
     
      
    31 Despite the fact that the offender pleaded not guilty there seems to be real regret that he caused the death of the deceased, although not immediately after the shooting in light of what he said to his brother. He has felt suicidal at times since the killing, but the psychologist who interviewed him did not believe he was at risk. 
     
      
    32 The Crown fairly does not suggest that the offence is one that would require the imposition of a life sentence. But as I have indicated the sentence must be a heavy one in light of the findings that I have made as a result of the verdict of murder. Once again I can only remark upon the awful consequences of the ready availability of firearms. This is another case where there has been the needless loss of life for the deceased and a waste of life for the offender as a result of what was, in the cold light of day, a fairly trivial incident between persons under the influence of alcohol. One can only extend sympathy to the deceased’s family who have to try to come to terms with such a senseless killing. 
     
      
    33 There are matters in the subjective circumstances of the offender that might result in the finding of special circumstances were the offender to be sentenced for a less serious offence than that presently before the court. But the appropriate sentence to meet the criminality of the offender for the murder of the deceased will be such that the application of the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period will provide ample time for what assistance is necessary to help in his rehabilitation on release. There is nothing which otherwise would justify a reduction in the period which he must serve before being released to parole. 
     
      
    34 Although the prisoner has been serving a sentence for an offence of drive while disqualified for part of the period while awaiting sentence for the murder, it seems to me that the appropriate order to make is to sentence the prisoner from the date of his arrest. The criminality of the murder overwhelms that for the other offence, even though he was on appeal bail in relation to that matter at the time of the killing. 
     
      
    35 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 24 years to date from 6 April 2001. There is to be a non-parole period of 18 years from the same date. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 5 April 2019.

     1 MEAGHER, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     2 SPERLING, J: I also agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     3 GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant in respect of an offence of supply of a prohibited drug, to wit, 4.42 grams of heroin. 
      
       
     4 The offence arises under s.25(1) and s.29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. It is punishable by a maximum of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $220,000. 
      
       
     5 The appellant had pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour Judge Dodd and a jury in the District Court of New South Wales in October 2001. The jury found him guilty. 
      
       
     6 The trial judge passed a sentence of imprisonment for three years to commence on the date upon which sentence was imposed, 28 February 2002, to expire on 27 February 2005. In respect of that sentence, a non-parole period of two years and three months, commencing on 28 February 2002 and expiring on 27 May 2004 was imposed. 
      
       
     7 On sentence, the trial judge took into account that the applicant had been in custody, bail refused, for some five days whilst the proceedings were pending but that he had otherwise remained on bail until sentence. 
      
       
     8 Four grounds of appeal against conviction are asserted. The are:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. The appellant did not receive a fair trial by reason of the admission of evidence relating to the finding of gold bars. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The appellant did not receive a fair trial by reason of the admission of evidence relating to the finding of cash and gold bars. 
         
        
        
         
          3. The learned trial judge did not give complete directions regarding the meaning of 'did supply'. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The learned trial judge gave flawed directions regarding the giving of evidence by the appellant."" 
         
        
       
     9 On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant's counsel conceded that the Crown case was very powerful and that, even if these grounds were upheld, the court might well apply the proviso in s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (see Regina v. Festa [2001] HCA 72). 
      
       
     10 Ground one represents a more particular focus of the matters referred to in ground two. It is convenient to deal with those two grounds together. 
      
       
     11 The following brief outline of facts is taken from the written submissions provided on the appellant's behalf:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant resided at 111 Edgeware Road, Enmore. On 30 March 2000, police there executed a search warrant. Upon a search of his person, police found heroin contained in six foils and nine water balloons. He had on his person about $650 in cash. 
         
        
        
         
         In the bedroom of the appellant and his wife, police found $4,000 in cash. In another room, possibly used in conjunction with a shrine, were located 24 small pure gold bars weighing 900 grams. The value of the bars was taken as $12,000. 
         
        
        
         
         Police located, in the kitchen, empty water balloons. In the living room, was located pieces of silver foil, scales and a heroin smoking implement. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant was interviewed. He made no admission of actually supplying heroin or having it for the purpose of supply. He gave evidence to the effect that the heroin was other than for supply."" 
         
        
       
     12 In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge referred to the summary of facts as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Police received information and as a result executed a search warrant at your home at 111 Edgeware Road, Enmore on 30 March 2000. You were present at the time and a search of your person revealed a film canister in your left trouser pocket containing six foils and nine multi-coloured water balloons containing a white rock substance. In your wallet was $650 in cash and a number of other items. 
         
        
        
         
         A search of your bedroom revealed, amongst other items, an amount of $4,000 in cash. In an adjacent bedroom police located 24 gold ingots each of 33.75 grams secreted in a shrine and in a vase. In an adjacent bedroom police located $1,500 in cash in a man's suit jacket. In the kitchen they located a further amount of rock substance in silver foil also thought to be heroin as was the previously referred to rock substance. Also located in the kitchen were two bags of multi-coloured water balloons similar to those located on your person. In the lounge room area police found a set of electronic scales in a video cassette cover. On the floor in the lounge room in an open packet of cigarettes were found several pieces of silver foil and a smoking implement for heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         You were arrested and taken to Newtown Police Station. You were interviewed by way of the ERISP procedure. The approximate value of the gold ingots was $12,000. At the outset of the interview with police you admitted that you had heroin in your possession. You said in the interview that you had not developed an intention one way or the other as to whether you might use it for yourself or might sell it but you had not made up your mind at that stage."" 
         
        
       
     13 I do not understand there to be any issue raised with the trial judge's account of those facts. 
      
       
     14 At the trial, it was the Crown case that the appellant had the heroin in his possession for the purposes of supply. The Crown relied upon the statutory consequence of possession of not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug whereby a person who has such an amount in their possession is deemed to have the prohibited drug in their possession for supply unless they prove that they had the prohibited drug in their possession otherwise than for supply (s.29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). The appellant sought to discharge the statutory onus by making a case that his possession of the drug was purely for his own use, relying upon evidence that he had been a heroin user for approximately two years and giving, by way of explanation for the scales, that they were required to ascertain the quantum available to him for his own use and for the balloons, that they were available for a party. He gave evidence himself in support of his own defence. 
      
       
     15 It is notable that the explanation given to the police of the applicant not having developed as at the time of the finding of the heroin an intention one way or the other would not, in itself, have satisfied the statutory burden lying upon the appellant as the Act requires the jury be satisfied of the positive contention that the possession was for a use other than for supply. 
      
       
     16 The appellant also gave evidence of the explanations for the presence of the money and the gold bars and it is to those matters that the first two grounds of appeal relate. 
      
       
     17 The trial judge was informed of an objection to the tender of evidence involving the gold at the outset of the trial. In an opening given to the trial judge, summarising the nature of the evidence for the purpose of the trial judge's ruling, he was informed by the Crown Prosecutor that in addition to money being found in the appellant's pocket and wallet, there was an amount of some $4,000 located in a bedroom shared by the appellant and his wife. That account continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In an adjacent room was located concealed in two separate spots 24 little gold bars, each weighing 37.5 grams of 24 carat purity, having a then value of approximately $12,000."" 
         
        
       
     18 Later in that opening the Crown referred to the finding in the house of numerous items, eg., a dozen new watches in packages still with tags in some cases, large quantities of new clothing and Manchester goods with tags, 15 mobile phones in a drawer, 70 odd bottles of shampoo and hair conditioner, large amounts of jewellery, a large amount of electrical equipment including certain items such as video recorders which had the serial numbers erased, which were entirely consistent with the dealing by the appellant in stolen goods. 
      
       
     19 At that time, the Crown Prosecutor said this:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I have given some thought to whether it is appropriate to even attempt to lead evidence in relation to the bulk of the material that was found in the house. The difficulty from the Crown's point of view is that it is difficult for me to rule out the possibility that the other material, although there is a powerful inference it was stolen material, it's hard to rule out an inference that it may not have been related to drug dealing. It could have just been the accused acting as a receiver of stolen goods."" 
         
        
       
     20 The Crown had pointed out that in that regard the accused faced charges of goods in custody in relation to the mass of the material that was found. The Crown contended that certain of the items that were found were clearly admissible. That was conceded by Mr. Conomos of counsel, a senior and experienced advocate appearing for the appellant. In particular, the trial judge was informed that Mr. Conomos did not argue that the scales, the balloons and the cash were inadmissible. 
      
       
     21 The Crown continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The only item that I am seeking to lead evidence about finding which is in dispute is the gold bars, the 24 gold bars which were located in a room which is called a shrine room. There was some sort of religious shrine in there, it wasn't a room used for someone to live in, and there were a lot of items in that room, including these gold bars. There was a granny flat out the back of the building which contained a large amount of cash and there was cash in another room. I'm not leading that because the evidence is that other persons lived in those areas of the house."" 
         
        
       
     22 The Crown Prosecutor went on to refer to his intention to lead in evidence the $4,000 found in the main bedroom and said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""And I will be endeavouring to lead evidence subject to your Honour's ruling of the gold bars."" 
         
        
       
     23 He referred to explanations given by the appellant to the police for the $4,000 found in the bedroom and the possession of the gold bars. The Crown Prosecutor referred to evidence that the appellant had been on unemployment benefits as had been his wife and that he had been unemployed and getting benefits for about 10 years, that the premises were owned by them both and that he had been sharing the main bedroom with his wife. 
      
       
     24 It was submitted that in the circumstances of apparent impoverishment and drug dealing, the presence of the gold bars was highly relevant to the jury's consideration of whether the appellant had the heroin in his possession for a purpose other than supply. 
      
       
     25 The Crown submitted:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""It's circumstantial evidence which would tend to support the Crown's submission that he was a dealer in the same way that his possession of $700 on his person and the $4,000 in the cupboard and the balloons and the scales, the fact that he had 15 separate lots of drugs in his pocket, all that goes to support the contention put forward by the Crown that this wasn't a self-use situation."" 
         
        
       
     26 Mr. Conomos on the appellant's behalf, told the trial judge that there was no argument about the primary facts. He contended that admission of the evidence of the gold ""would tip the balance against a fair trial"". ""If the jury have that there'd be no defence to go to the jury."" He argued that once the evidence of the money, the drugs and the scales, together with the appellant being a methadone user was before the jury to add the evidence of the gold would elevate the matter into a different endeavour entirely, in particular, because there were other persons in the house and he referred to the appellant having told the police that the bars belonged to his wife. 
      
       
     27 The trial judge heard short argument as to whether the presence of the gold was merely relevant to past dealing and ruled:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr. Conomos, it seems to me the gold is in the same category as the cash, so I rule that the Crown is entitled to lead the evidence of the finding of the gold."" 
         
        
       
     28 In this court it is submitted that there was no need for the gold bar evidence to be admitted because there was already enough evidence for the Crown to make its point about possessions beyond the appellant's means by using the evidence of the money. It was submitted that the gold bars, by their nature, are in a form that suggests the accumulation of finances ""in the way of people who look outside the banks as a place to keep their liquid assets"". It was in addition suggested, that, although drugs are on the street exchanged for cash, a drugs for gold exchange is virtually unheard of, so that the presence of the gold leads only to an inference of prior accumulated wealth. It was submitted that the gold was consistent with other illegal activity or having been legally acquired. It was suggested that the small amount of drug found did not, of itself, suggest any correlation with the gold in question. 
      
       
     29 These submissions entirely miss the point. It was open to the jury to reject the accused's explanations in evidence and in the recorded interview. It was open to the jury to reject the various explanations he gave in evidence for the presence in his home of the paraphernalia which were the indicia of drug dealing and for the jury to accept that the presence of that paraphernalia and accumulated wealth pointed to his intending to deal with the heroin with which he had been found rather than to use it all for his own purposes. That there was other additional evidence useful for the same purpose and that an explanation was offered for this evidence does not deprive this evidence of significance and, hence admissibility. Nor is there any substantial prejudice, much less unfair prejudice, apparent. 
      
       
     30 Evidence of the presence of the gold bars was material which, in my view, the jury were perfectly entitled to have regard to, just as they were entitled to have regard to the significant sums of cash in the premises where heroin was found, notwithstanding that cash could not be said to have come from dealing in the instant heroin. 
      
       
     31 So far as the presence of the cash was concerned, it may have been explicable from dealing in stolen goods or from, as was suggested, being the property of the wife or obtained by reason of having been obtained from a Vietnamese mutual investment fund (a ""hui""), a fund created from a pool of money subscribed by a number of people each of whom may bid to draw down money from the amount pooled at differing times. The jury was entitled to reject that explanation. 
      
       
     32 The fact that some such explanation might be asserted does not make the evidence inadmissible or require its exclusion in discretion. 
      
       
     33 When the presence of the cash was considered in conjunction with the ownership of the premises by the appellant and his wife, that the amount outstanding on mortgage in respect of the premises was in the vicinity of some $130,000 but that in late 1999 a builder had been paid by the appellant's wife $80,000 in cash to renovate the premises, notwithstanding that the appellant and his wife had received various Government benefits and pensions over the previous 10 years on which they had lived, the presence of that cash adopts considerable significance, considering the issue confided by the legislation to the jury. 
      
       
     34 As conceded by the Crown, the value of the drug found in the possession of the appellant was not necessarily ""correlated"" with that of the gold or the cash found at the appellant's house. But, as the Crown submits, the finding of the gold and the cash were relevant circumstances which the Crown was entitled to have in evidence to enable the jury to consider whether the appellant had displaced the effect of the deeming provision. The evidence of the cash and the gold bars was also important as affecting the credibility of the applicant when he gave evidence asserting the heroin was for his own use. There was no error in admitting the evidence of the presence of the gold bars. 
      
       
     35 Further, so far as the cash was concerned, senior and experienced trial counsel conceded its admissibility. It is sought now to contend, notwithstanding there was no evidence at trial to suggest it, that because of the presence of the stolen goods it is possible that the money might have been related to dealing in stolen goods rather than drug dealing and that, in those circumstances, accompanying the probative value to be attached to the evidence of the existence of the cash was an unacceptable, unfair prejudice (see s.137 of the Evidence Act 1995). On the present charge, were the jury of the view the money was related to dealing in stolen goods, that would have assisted the appellant's case. 
      
       
     36 For the same reasons I have given in relation to the evidence of the gold bars, the evidence of the cash was admissible. It was not only not objected to, but at trial, counsel conceded it was relevant and should be admitted. Since this is a matter to which Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules relates and because senior and experienced trial counsel specifically conceded the admissibility of the cash, leave should not be granted to the appellant to raise this ground. I would reject grounds one and two. 
      
       
     37 Ground three, as well, raises a matter that was not asserted at trial and to which Rule 4 applies. 
      
       
     38 It is submitted that the trial judge failed to give compendious legal directions concerning the meaning of ""did supply"". The trial judge did direct the jury about the matters concerning which it had to be satisfied. He directed the jury as to the ordinary meaning of the term ""supply"" and that the issue in the case was whether the accused had the heroin in his possession otherwise than for supply. He directed the jury that it was the accused's case that he had it in his possession for his personal use and that if the jury were of the view that it was more likely than not that he was telling the truth when he said that, they had to find the appellant not guilty. 
      
       
     39 It is now contended that he should have explained the statutory underpinning to liability so arising although it is not contended that the lack of such explanation would have had other than a purely theoretical significance in the case. 
      
       
     40 In dealing with this submission, some reiteration of the principles relating to the judge's function when summing up is appropriate. It is not necessary that a summing up should contain a ""disquisition on jurisprudence or philosophy or a universally applicable circular tour round the area of law affected by the case"" – The Queen v. Lawrence (1981) 1 All ER 974. It is not the function of a trial judge to expound to the jury matters of law going beyond those which the jurors need to understand to resolve the issues that arise for decision in the case – The Queen v. Chai [2002] HCA 12. 
      
       
     41 Judges should generally seek to simplify and shorten summings up and should avoid lectures on the law and unnecessary explanations of legal principles – Regina v. Williams (1990) 50 A. Crim. R. 213. The summing up should address the real issues as the case is fought – Alford v. Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466 and deal with the factual issues that arise – Regina v. Sandford (1994) 33 NSWLR 172. 
      
       
     42 This summing up met those tests. The criticisms are misconceived. The matter was not raised at trial. I see no possible basis for there being any miscarriage of justice. In my view, Rule 4 applies and leave should be refused. 
      
       
     43 Ground four claims that the trial judge gave flawed directions concerning the giving of evidence by the appellant. It is contended in that regard that by specifically referring to the appellant in a passage in which his Honour directed the jury concerning the appellant's entitlement to have said nothing at all, rather than to have given evidence, he fell into critical error. That passage is as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The accused gave evidence. He was not obliged to do that. He could have said nothing at all, but he chose to give evidence and thereby subject himself to cross-examination. That choice by him does not of course mean that the evidence he gave was necessarily true. His evidence simply falls into the same category as the evidence of the other witnesses who gave evidence and were subject to cross-examination. By going into the witness box the accused made himself a witness in the same sense as all of the other witnesses. Exactly the same principles apply in the evaluation of his truthfulness and reliability as apply to the other witnesses."" 
         
        
       
     44 It is contended that this passage shows that ""his Honour has here singled out honesty alone concerning the appellant as an aspect for scrutiny"". It is contended that by reason of the use of the phrase ""of course"" and what is asserted to be a contrast with general directions his Honour had given about similar considerations earlier in the summing up, there was a suggestion given to the jury that the appellant may not be ""giving evidence that is necessarily true because he has a vested interest in his own case"" (see Robinson v. The Queen (1991) 180 CLR 531). It was submitted this was particularly important in this case as the appellant had the burden of making out the statutory offence. I do not see the slightest substance in that submission. 
      
       
     45 I am reinforced in my view as no objection was raised by senior and experienced counsel at the trial. The direction was legally accurate and fair. Again Rule 4 applies. Leave should be refused. 
      
       
     46 I therefore conclude that none of the grounds are made out. The Crown case was overwhelming. I see no basis for any assertion of any risk of miscarriage of justice. I see no error and therefore no need to turn to the application of the proviso. 
      
       
     47 On the application for leave to appeal against sentence, it was submitted that the learned trial judge had fallen into error in failing to find special circumstances. True it is that there were matters proved in evidence that the trial judge may have considered to be special circumstances. However, the finding of special circumstances amounts to a characterising by the trial judge of matters proved in evidence considered by that judge to have that character having regard to all the circumstances to which regard is to be had when imposing the individual sentence. Essentially, the attribution to facts found by the trial judge of that character is a matter for the trial judge and the exercise of his discretion to impose a non-parole period which involves a parole period longer than that s.44(1)(b) prima facie requires: see Regina v. Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534. I see nothing in the present circumstances which would have required the trial judge to make any such findings. 
      
       
     48 It was also argued that overall, the sentence was excessive and that the appellant should have been treated as though this offence was an isolated one. The trial judge held the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In your favour, although it is not an excuse, but it does place the commission of the crime in context, is the fact that you were, at the time of the commission of the offence, a heroin user. Also in your favour is the fact that you have stopped using heroin since your arrest. Also in your favour is that you have no prior convictions for drug trafficking, but in my view, that is of little significance in view of the verdict and the basis for it and my finding that you were a dealer in heroin at the time of this offence which was not an isolated instance of the selling of heroin."" 
         
        
       
     49 Later, the trial judge said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""However, because this is not an isolated matter, because as I have found, you were a drug dealer."" 
         
        
       
     50 It will be apparently that the trial judge has failed to extend leniency to the appellant on the basis of this being an isolated offence. On the proved facts, I see no error in his Honour coming to this conclusion. His Honour's views were amply supported by the verdict and the evidence. The submission that the presence of stolen goods in the premises deprives the drug dealer's paraphernalia, including the money and the gold bars found in the premises, of that significance lacks reality. The sentence is on the statistics well within the appropriate range. Nor do I see that the sentence and non-parole period imposed are in any way tainted by any error or, indeed, having regard to the appellant's criminality, excessive. We were informed from the bar table that the appellant's family had, by reason of his imprisonment, been undergoing considerable hardship. That is a matter which, on appeal, is not, in accordance with the authorities, open to us to take into account. In my view, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the matter having been fully argued, and the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     51 The orders I propose are: the appeal against conviction be dismissed; leave to appeal against sentence be granted, and the appeal be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Meagher JA: I agree with Sperling J. 
      
       
     2 Sperling J: This is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed on the respondent, Peter Austin Brownlow, by O’Reilly DCJ on 14 June 2002. The respondent had pleaded guilty on 14 September 2001, at Penrith Local Court, to two counts of malicious wounding, being an offence against s35(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment. The respondent was thereupon committed for sentence to the District Court pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act 1902. 
      
       
     3 The respondent was sentenced on each count to 15 months imprisonment to date from 14 June 2002, with a non-parole period of five months, the sentences to be served concurrently. 
      
       
     4 The sentencing judge took into account a period of approximately three and a half weeks in custody before the respondent was released on bail.  
      
       
     5 His Honour also gave the respondent the benefit of a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     6 Section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that, on a Crown appeal, this court may, in its discretion, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the court may seem proper. 
      
       
     7 The principles relating to a Crown appeal are well settled. They include the following. The right of the Crown to appeal is an exceptional power, to be exercised rarely, and in order to allow the court to lay down sentencing principles. The appeal will only be allowed if the sentence is manifestly inadequate. This must amount to an error in the exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge. It is not sufficient that the appellate court would have imposed a more severe sentence. Notwithstanding that the appellate court might be satisfied that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, it has a discretion whether to intervene. The appellate court will normally only substitute a sentence which is less than would otherwise be appropriate on the basis of double jeopardy. This may result in the appellate court not intervening in the exercise of its discretion.  
      
       
     8 The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The respondent and his girlfriend Michelle Wilkinson had been involved in a five year de facto relationship. At the time of the offence, they had recently ended their relationship, with Wilkinson commencing a relationship with Alexander Kosic. Ms Wilkinson and Mr Kosic lived together at 54 Francis Street, Richmond. 
      
       
     9 Shortly after 7 pm on Wednesday 1 November 2000, the respondent and co-offender Terrence Hill (who was also to became a victim), left the respondent’s home in Mt Druitt to go to Ms Wilkinson’s home to collect money owed to the respondent. Before leaving home, the respondent armed himself with a machete (the blade being about 14 inches long). Mr Hill advised the respondent to leave it behind, however, the respondent secreted the machete in a toolbox on Mr Hill’s utility. The respondent and Mr Hill travelled to the Overlander Hotel at Kingswood, where they met up with the other co-offenders, Matthew Dimmock, Mark Evans and Jason Sharpe. Further discussion about attending Ms Wilkinson’s home took place at the hotel. 
      
       
     10 Mr Evans subsequently armed himself with an aluminium baseball bat. 
      
       
     11 The five men then travelled to 54 Francis Street, Richmond in Mr Dimmock’s Commodore sedan, arriving at about 9.45 pm. On the way, Mr Hill discussed starting a fight once they arrived, and “hurting people”. 
      
       
     12 Upon arrival at the premises, Mr Hill and Mr Sharpe approached the front door whilst the respondent, armed with the machete, and Mr Evans, armed with the aluminium baseball bat, hid behind shrubs near the front of the house. On the front porch, Mr Hill and Mr Sharpe engaged Ms Wilkinson and Mr Kocic in a conversation about money allegedly owed.  
      
       
     13 The respondent then came forward swinging the machete in a circular motion and saying “You’re going to pay for what you did, and if I can’t have you no one can”. A brawl then began. 
      
       
     14 Duane Hodges, a friend of Mr Kosic and Ms Wilkinson, was also present in the front yard. During the brawl, the respondent struck Mr Hodges to the left elbow and abdomen.  
      
       
     15 The respondent, while still holding the machete, grabbed the co-offender Mr Hill by the shoulders in order to pull him away. In the process of doing so, Mr Hill suffered a serious laceration to his left ear lobe, which was almost severed. 
      
       
     16 The respondent and Mr Hill left the scene on foot and were picked up by Mr Hill’s mother from Richmond Railway Station. Mr Dimmock remained at the scene, whilst Mr Evans and Mr Sharpe were apprehended by police a short distance away. Mr Hill was arrested at Nepean Hospital on Thursday 2 November 2000, where he was having surgery on his ear. 
      
       
     17 On Friday 3 November 2000, the respondent surrendered himself at Windsor Police Station. He was arrested and electronically interviewed. He made admissions as to arming himself with a machete, and having it in his possession during the brawl. He denied using it to injure anyone. 
      
       
     18 The injuries caused by the respondent were as follows. Mr Hodges suffered a superficial laceration to his abdomen and a large compound wound to his left elbow with a fracture of the left olecranon. His treatment included lavage and debridement of wounds. The abdominal wound required eight stitches whilst the left elbow wound was debrided, explored and an open reduction and tension band wiring of the olecranon was carried out. Mr Hodges has suffered a permanent two per cent loss of movement in his arm. As a result of the injuries sustained, he was unable to work for ten months and had incurred substantial medical expenses. 
      
       
     19 Mr Hill suffered an 8 cm laceration to the left elbow – to subcutaneous fat only – and a laceration to the left ear lobe. The arm wound was cleaned and sutured in the emergency department, and the wound to the left ear was surgically repaired. Mr Hill had made a full recovery. 
      
       
     20 As to the respondent’s state of mind, his Honour said 
      
       
        
         
         He  
         [the respondent]  
         says that he did not deliberately inflict the injuries and that by his plea that must be so. It cannot be assumed that he had any intention to cause injuries of this nature.  
         
        
       
     21 The finding as recorded is not clear. However, at the least, it is to be recognised, that there was no finding that injury was deliberate. That was conformable with the evidence which did not show that the respondent intended to strike Mr Hodges with the weapon. There was positive evidence that the injury to Mr Hill was unintentional.  
      
       
     22 “Maliciously” is an element of the offence under s35(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 5 of the Act provides that an act done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering and without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, is to be taken to have been done maliciously. The facts do not rise higher than indifference and recklessness in this case.  
      
       
     23 The respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.  
      
       
     24 The evidence relating to the personal circumstances of the respondent was as follows. 
      
       
     25 The respondent was 24 years at the time of the offences. 
      
       
     26 Two reports were tendered on behalf of the respondent. A psychologist’s report dated 25 March 2002 was prepared by Anna Robilliard and was tendered on sentence. The report stated that the respondent at the interview showed no sign of thought disorder or significant mood disturbance. He was born on 31 July 1977 being aged 24 years at the time of interview. The respondent had one sibling, a married sister to whom he was close. His father was killed in an accident at work when the respondent was aged four and a half years. The death of his father had had a lasting impact on the respondent who very often thought about his father and missed him. After his father’s death, the respondent’s mother formed a relationship with a man 20 years older than herself. This relationship finished when the man departed for Queensland. When the respondent was aged 14 years his mother formed a relationship with a man who proved violent and a heavy drinker. That man and his son lived with the respondent and his mother for three unhappy years. The relationship broke down. Later, the respondent’s mother took up with another man and this relationship has proved successful.  
      
       
     27 At primary school, the respondent was considered to be hyperactive. At high school he appears to have mixed with “the wrong crowd” because he began truanting regularly. He left school at age 15 years, being part way through year nine. 
      
       
     28 The respondent began work at a wrecker’s yard and then worked at a service station. He showed an interest in cars and mechanical work. He next worked with a carpenter refurbishing shops. He did this work for several years. The respondent ultimately lost this job because his girlfriend Ms Wilkinson with whom he had a relationship which was broken off in August 2000, would visit him at work often, “sit around” and also telephone him constantly. His employer found this intolerable and the respondent lost the job. 
      
       
     29 The relationship with Ms Wilkinson lasted about five years. The respondent was aged 19 years and she was aged 15 years when they met. Whilst they lived in rented accommodation, other young people would come to their place to share “pot”. The relationship deteriorated and they would argue. Ms Wilkinson developed anorexia. She needed medical and other treatment. She became unstable and the respondent had to look after her. She continued to take drugs. 
      
       
     30 When the respondent turned 21 years, he received an inheritance of nearly $100,000. After buying a car, he later allowed Ms Wilkinson to take money out of the account and the balance fell to about $32,000. In 1999 she spent about $10,000 of the money on drugs. The two had broken up in August 2000 and the respondent said that Ms Wilkinson agreed to pay him back $30,000 that she owed him.  
      
       
     31 The respondent described himself as a “real mess” at that stage. He was using alcohol and drugs in order to cope with life. Consequently, at that stage, he regarded himself as unfit for work. 
      
       
     32 He began using alcohol in his early teens. Occasionally two of his uncles would encourage him to drink large amounts. At the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, the respondent began to drink “fairly constantly”. On occasions, he had drunk two bottles of bourbon a day, plus half a carton of beer. Sometimes, he also used amphetamines and cannabis. However, after he was charged with the present offences and released from custody he reported being able to contain his drinking to having the “odd drink”. 
      
       
     33 The respondent had said that he began using cannabis at the age of 11 to 12 years but, by his mid teens, this using had become a regular habit. During his relationship with his girlfriend, he had begun using amphetamines and associating with teenagers who took drugs. A significant amount of the respondent’s inheritance was spent on drugs. The respondent said that when he separated from Ms Wilkinson, his drug taking increased significantly in conjunction with his alcohol intake as mentioned earlier. The respondent said that, since being charged with the present offences, he had stopped using drugs and had not been tempted to resume. 
      
       
     34 Tests administered to the respondent showed him to be in the below average range of intelligence. No entrenched anti social attitudes were in evidence. It was noted that he had become involved with a youth mission associated with the Catholic Church. A cautionary note was sounded as to the respondent’s propensity to develop dependent relationships. 
      
       
     35 The respondent admitted to the psychologist that, in the relevant incident, he was holding a machete, but claimed that he did not deliberately inflict injuries on the victims. He was reported to be remorseful over the offences, and regretful of the injuries to the victims. 
      
       
     36 It was reported that the respondent was highly motivated to comply with an alternative to a custodial sentence. It was said that the three and a half week period in custody following his arrest had had a profound impact on him. It was suggested that he would benefit from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and psychological counselling. 
      
       
     37 The respondent appears not to have told Ms Robilliard that he had resumed the relationship with Ms Wilkinson, as mentioned in the Probation and Parole report. 
      
       
     38 A Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report was prepared on 8 May 2002. The respondent had earlier been subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service in respect of an offence of maliciously destroy property in April 2001. His response to supervision was described as unsatisfactory, the respondent failing to report as required. He had not commenced “anger management” counselling as directed. However, he had remained gainfully employed and apparently avoided criminal associations and claimed to have desisted from illicit drug use and minimised his use of alcohol. 
      
       
     39 The respondent said that he maintained regular contact with his mother and older sister. He revealed his resumption of the relationship with his former girlfriend, and that they were expecting the arrival of twins in September 2002. He had at first said that he was not in a relationship of any kind. 
      
       
     40 The respondent’s current employer spoke highly of his skills and abilities. The employer was apparently very supportive of the respondent and mentioned the possibility of advancement depending on the outcome of the sentence proceedings. 
      
       
     41 The respondent had denied an intention to harm anyone during the incident on 1 November 2000, and claimed that he only had possession of the machete for his own protection, believing that there were aggressive males at the place where he and his co-offenders had gone. He claimed that the injuries he had inflicted were accidental. He denied swinging the weapon and being aware that serious injuries had been inflicted. He had not learnt of this until later. He said that had he intended to inflict injury there would have much more serious injuries inflicted, because the machete was capable of causing very serious injuries. 
      
       
     42 The reporting officer described the applicant as “guarded” during the interview with him. The respondent had not satisfactorily explained his failure to reveal his true current circumstances in relation to Ms Wilkinson earlier, or his earlier failure to co-operate with the parole service, although it was indicated that he had maintained worthwhile employment and appeared to have good prospects in this regard. The respondent was considered to be minimising his role in the offences, the version he gave being at odds with the material placed before the Court. (I would interpolate that the respondent’s recollection of events as they truly occurred is likely to have been impugned by alcohol consumed at the hotel en route.) 
      
       
     43 The respondent’s employer, Michael Organ, testified that he had asked the respondent to come work for him in his firewood distribution business after seeing him working for a concreter in his yard. He spoke very highly of the respondent as an employee who showed great versatility and skill and in whom he had great faith. He said that he needed the respondent “desperately” in order to run his business.  
      
       
     44 Mr Organ stated that the respondent and his girlfriend lived in his Cooper Street house in Katoomba and that he had stringent rules in relation to the house, that is, no smoking, no drinking and no drugs. Mr Organ said that he was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and that the respondent had voluntarily attended several meetings with him. 
      
       
     45 Mr Organ stated that, if the respondent received a full-time custodial sentence, he would have to be replaced, but that he would offer him the position again if it was available after the sentence had been served. 
      
       
     46 The respondent’s mother, Lynette Brownlow, gave evidence that, during his three weeks in custody, the respondent appeared upset and did not handle it very well. When the respondent was released on bail, he resided with her. In that time, she noticed a change in the respondent in that he looked after himself and no longer used drugs or alcohol. He looked for work and tried to get his life back together. 
      
       
     47 In relation to the offence, Ms Brownlow stated that the respondent had told her that he was very sorry for what he had done. 
      
       
     48 Ms Brownlow had recently become aware that the respondent was back with his girlfriend and that they were living together at Katoomba in premises belonging to the respondent’s employer. She stated that they were “pulling themselves together” and were improving. 
      
       
     49 The foregoing account of the evidence before the sentencing judge is taken from the Crown’s written submissions. The Crown’s resume of that evidence was not queried on the hearing of the appeal. 
      
       
     50 The objective facts of the case involved a number of aggravating factors. The attack involved the use of a weapon capable of inflicting death or very serious injury. It was a planned attack, rather than something done on the spur of the moment. Although there was the underlying emotional element of the previous relationship, which appears to have inflamed the situation, the objective of the respondent’s visit was a calculated attempt to recover what the respondent regarded as money owing to him, by threat or force. The attack was carried out in company, outnumbering those against whom it was directed. One at least of the respondent’s companions was armed with a baseball bat. The attack involved intrusion onto private property. On the other hand, sentencing must proceed on the basis that the injuries were inflicted with indifference and recklessly, rather than intentionally. Nonetheless, this was a very serious offence.  
      
       
     51 On the other hand, there were weighty subjective factors in mitigation. The respondent was born on 31 July 1977. He was 23 years of age at the time of the offence. He was of less than average intelligence. Since the offence, he had turned over a new leaf. He had ceased using drugs and had ceased excessive use of alcohol. He had resumed a settled relationship with Ms Wilkinson and had accepted the responsibilities of prospective fatherhood in relation to the twins with which she was pregnant. He was a diligent employee who had earned the respect and support of his employer.  
      
       
     52 As to contrition, the sentencing judge said, 
      
       
        
         
         I do not think we can talk much about contrition in this particular case. 
         
        
       
     53 There was scant evidence of contrition, the respondent not having given evidence on oath at the sentencing hearing. I take the sentencing judge to have made no finding in favour of the respondent in relation to contrition. Nor would I.  
      
       
     54 The respondent was not entitled to consideration as a person with little or no criminal record. In 1999 he was convicted of a serious driving offence, namely, driving with low-range PCA. In the same year, he was convicted of larceny, and in the year 2001, he was convicted of maliciously destroying or damaging property. In relation to each of the first two offences, a fine was imposed. In relation to the third offence, he was placed on a good behaviour bond under supervision.  
      
       
     55 The sentencing judge found special circumstances by reason of the respondent’s age and the fact that this would be his first custodial sentence. The respondent’s steps in his own rehabilitation also qualified for consideration in that regard. 
      
       
     56 Were I sentencing the respondent at first instance, I would impose a sentence of three years imprisonment after allowing a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, with a non-parole period of two years. This is a Crown appeal. I would, in the exercise of the court’s discretion, reduce the non-parole period to one year in deference to the principle of double jeopardy.  
      
       
     57 This result is consistent with the sentences imposed on the respondent’s co-offenders. Only Mr Hill warrants mention in that regard. Although Mr Hill’s culpability was not as great as that of the respondent, it was substantial. Mr Hill was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. That is a heavier sentence than that proposed for the respondent. But Mr Hill did not plead guilty. And there was no double jeopardy constraining the sentencing judge in that case. Then there are the strong subjective considerations in favour of the respondent in the present case. 
      
       
     58 Allowance is to be made for the period of approximately one month’s custody prior to sentence. I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal allowed; 
        
        
       2. Vary the sentence by imposing a sentence of two years and 11 months imprisonment commencing on 14 June 2002, with a non-parole period of 11 months expiring on 13 May 2003; 
        
        
       3. Direct the release of the respondent on 13 May 2003; 
        
        
       4. Impose a condition on the parole order that the respondent be subject to supervision prescribed by the regulations under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 during the period 14 May 2003 to 13 May 2005.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
        
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL I have read the judgment in draft of Sully J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
      
       
     2 SULLY J: On 26 February 2002 Mr. Gibson, the appellant, and one Daniel David Stephens were jointly arraigned in the District Court upon an indictment containing three counts. 
      
       
     3 The first count charged the two accused jointly: 
      
       
        
         
         “For that they on 1 August 1998 at Jindabyne in the State of New South Wales did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Clinton Joseph Portelli with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Clinton Joseph Portelli.” 
         
        
        
       Each accused pleaded not guilty, and was put accordingly upon trial by jury. The jury found the appellant and Mr. Stephens not guilty, of this particular charge. 
        
       
     4 The second count charged the two accused jointly: 
      
       
        
         
         “For that they on 1 August 1998 at Jindabyne in the State of New South Wales did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Clinton Joseph Portelli.” 
         
        
        
       Each accused pleaded not guilty and was put accordingly upon trial by jury. The jury found the appellant guilty, and his co-accused not guilty, of this charge. An offence of this character contravenes section 35(b) of the  
       Crimes Act 1900, 
        and attracts upon conviction a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. In due course the appellant was convicted and was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
        
       
     5 The third count charged both accused: 
      
       
        
         
         “For that they on 1 August 1998 at Jindabyne in the State of New South Wales did assault Craig Michael Hansen thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm.” 
         
        
        
       Both of the co-accused pleaded not guilty and they were put accordingly upon trial by jury. The jury found the appellant guilty, and his co-accused not guilty, of this particular charge. An offence of this character contravenes section 59 of the  
       Crimes Act 1900 
       , and attracts upon conviction a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. In due course the appellant was convicted and was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months. 
        
       
     6 The sentences of imprisonment thus imposed upon the appellant were partially accumulated. The practical effect of what was done was to pass upon the appellant sentences of imprisonment of 4 years and 10 months, of which 3 years and 4 months are actually to be served. That non-parole period expires on 4 August 2005. 
      
       
     7 The appellant challenges his convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences passed upon him. 
      
       
     8 The essence of the Crown case at trial is summarised conveniently and as follows in the written submission lodged by the Crown in connection with the present appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “At about 3.30 to 4.00 am on 1 August 1998 the appellant became involved in a fight with the victims in the Aspen Hotel at Jindabyne. On the Crown case the appellant was the aggressor. He gave some advice regarding the rules of a pool game the victims were playing at the time with two girls. The appellant punched the victim Portelli in the face. The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He agreed that he had punched the victim in the face ‘a couple of times’ inside the Aspen Hotel. However, his evidence was to the effect that Portelli was the aggressor. His evidence was that someone hit him from behind, so he turned around and punched the victim Portelli, not knowing whether Portelli had been the one who hit him. He stated that Portelli was moving forward to punch him, so he punched Portelli first. Mr. Hansen came to Portelli’s aid and other patrons intervened to break up the fight. Security guards intervened and the appellant was asked to leave the hotel, which he did. He and a number of other patrons gathered at the front exit of the hotel. After about ten minutes the appellant and his friend Hansen were ushered out the back of the hotel. At this time, the appellant was seen to point into the hotel and he and the group out the front ran to the right side of the hotel. It was the Crown case that the appellant was the leader of this group and that the plan was to assault the victims outside the hotel in revenge for what had occurred inside. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence of Hansen was that outside the hotel, the appellant led an attack on Portelli. Hansen said ‘look who we’ve found here’. Another person said ‘come on, let’s fight, let’s finish it’. The appellant then punched Portelli to the ground. Hansen was then punched to the ground by someone other than the appellant and while on the ground saw two people kicking Portelli in the head. Hansen was also kicked in the head. There was no direct evidence that the appellant kicked either victim in the head, although he was seen by the witness Robinson in a group of six people, one of whom was kicking Portelli in the head. When Robinson reached the group the kicking had stopped and the appellant was standing on the right hand side of the victim Portelli ‘near the head end’. The appellant was sentenced on the basis that his role was that he punched Portelli to the ground and then remained there aiding and encouraging others who were kicking the victims. 
         
        
        
         
         The victim Portelli suffered a number of injuries, the most serious being a serious head injury resulting in brain damage. Mr. Portelli had amnesia and could remember nothing of the events the subject of the charges.  
         
        
        
         
         On 5 August 1998 on a chance visit to the Jindabyne Police Station to inquire as to the progress of the police investigation Hansen passed the appellant leaving the police station with two other people (his mother and solicitor Mr. Galanos). Sergeant Scott witnessed this event as he looked out from the police station. Hansen immediately told Sergeant Scott that the appellant was the person who had assaulted Portelli inside and outside the Aspen Hotel. The appellant, his mother and his solicitor (who had also been his step-father for many years) denied seeing Hansen outside the police station on 5 August 1998.”  
         [Note:the transcript references included in the submission as filed have been omitted] 
         
        
       
     9 Four grounds of appeal against conviction were argued. It is expedient to deal with them in the following order. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
     10 The ground is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown’s failure to call Guy Stephens, the brother of the Appellant’s co-accused, who was an eye-witness to the relevant events, as a witness in the Crown case, occasioned a miscarriage of justice ( 
         R v Kneebone  
         (1999) 47 NSWLR 450).” 
         
        
        
        
       
     · The Potential Evidence of Guy Stephens: his Interview, electronically recorded, on 24 August 1998 
      
       
     11 On 24 August 1998 Mr. Stephens was interviewed by investigating police. It seems that the prosecuting authorities did not have any further access to Mr. Stephens until 22 February 2002; and that a conference was had with him by the Crown Prosecutor on 25 February 2002. On 26 February 2002, the first day of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor intimated that she did not propose to call Mr. Stephens as a witness in the Crown case. 
      
       
     12 The interview of 24 August 1998 was electronically recorded. A transcript of the interview was available to the learned trial Judge. The interview occupied, inclusive of the attendant formalities, from 7 pm to 8.35 pm; and embraces, inclusive of formal questions, 455 questions.  
      
       
     13 Mr. Stephens identifies himself in the interview as the elder brother of the appellant’s co-accused. At questions 53 and following Mr. Stephens tells the police that he is acquainted with a person whom he knows only by the name of “Pep”. He says that he knows “Pep” as a person living with his brother; that he has himself known “Pep” since about January 1998; and that he had most recently seen “Pep” on 1 August 1998 at the time of the incident which the police were then investigating and which they had earlier described to Mr. Stephens as “………………… the assault of a person by the name of Clinton Portelli on the 1st August 1998”. Mr. Stephens describes “Pep” as “(p)robably medium” in build. Mr. Stephens expands that description as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “He’s of, usually, usually has his hair short, old, older appearance, I suppose, probably round about 30 years old. I can’t remember, yeah, well, sort of pale, pale complexion.” 
         
        
        
       Mr. Stephens says that, at the time of the relevant events of 1 August 1998, “Pep” had one of his arms in a sling because, Mr. Stephens understood, “Pep” had broken his collarbone snow-boarding on that day. Mr. Stephens tells the police that he does not know “Pep’s” family name.  
        
       
     14 At questions 77 and following Mr. Stephens gives his first extended account of his recollections of the relevant events that occurred in the early hours of Saturday, 1 August 1998: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q 77 Can you tell me what you did from the time you finished work on the Friday to the next day? 
         
        
        
         
         A. From the time I finished work, well, this is going back, well, basically probably would, would have just gone home, chilled out on, on the lounge a bit, had something to eat at home and then I think by, by about, about 6.00, 6 o’clock or 7 o’clock, I would’ve headed down to, to Mario’s for this coaches, coaches meeting and, I don’t know, would have stayed there for a few hours. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.78 Then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And then, then, then I, I went down to the, well, I went from there with some, some of the, the other coaches that, that were there and instructors, down to the Jindabyne Hotel, and continued, continued drinking and did some gambling down there, which, I already told you before, had, had a bit of a win and, and then we were, yeah, shouting and hours, I was shouting lots of drinks all night. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.79 Can you just speak up for us for the tapes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.80 And what happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Then, well, after that I would have headed over to the, probably to the Aspen, I’m not too sure whether we stopped by the Balcony, or, or anything, but next thing I knew, I, I was at the Aspen, and, yeah, I, I was sitting at the table by the front window talking to, to Chris, and noticed, noticed these two, two guys that were, I don’t know, they were going off quite, quite a bit, this, this, this Clinton guy and his blond haired friend, they seemed, seemed to be pretty aggressive. I don’t know, just, don’t really know what, what happened there, but a scuffle broke out and I just sort of jumped up and brake, broke it up. Then the, the bouncers, I don’t know they, they kicked Troy, Troy out, Dan, Dan was there as well, Dan, Troy, I think that, that what happened were, I don’t know these, these two guys were, were, were picking on, on, on these other friends, friends of Troy’s or something, and they were giving them a hard time playing pool or whatever. And then just this Clinton guy was just going, he was breathing really heavily about you know, about centimetres away from Troy and then I, I would have probably just turned, turned my back and ……………….. and that’s, that’s when the, the scuffle broke out and I jumped up, broke, broke it up. And then, then the others, others left and I, I stayed there and finished, finished my drink. I actually shook hands with both Clinton and his blond haired friend, and they said to me, ‘Thanks, thanks for breaking it up’. Yeah, and then walked outside and these two, these two guys must have been, must have been led out the back entrance, ‘cause they were, ‘cause, you know, I, I shook hands with them as I left and then, then when I came, came around the corner, one of them was charging up, charging up the hill into this group of, group of guys. There must have been, I don’t know, eight, eight guys walking up there, and, and this guy just charged on in. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.81 Then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And then there was, you know, I could make out there was just lots of stumbling around and it was just like all, all over in 10 seconds. It was just a, a blur of shadowy, shadowy figures. Like, I must have been 40, 50 metres away from it. Yeah, and - 
         
        
        
         
         Q.82 What happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, there, there just seemed to be a lot of yelling and stuff going on and it just seemed like the, the police came out of the station, started trying to break, break things up, settle things down and just, all, all these figures just started dispersing, and I, I went and, went and saw that, saw that the guy that had been, been knocked, and he was laying face, face down, rolled him over and he was sort of, like, snoring. And then the, the police was still trying to calm, well, I don’t know, apprehend this blond haired guy who seemed to be going quite, quite nuts, and I, I basically just walked, walked home by myself. Yeah, yeah, that’s basically what I saw.” 
         
        
       
     15 In subsequent answers, Mr. Stephens says that he might have had a beer at home before leaving to walk to Mario’s for the coaches meeting; that he had, at Mario’s, a pizza to eat; and to drink, between five and ten stubbies of beer and some “regular shots, mixed with dry,” of bourbon. He can say nothing about the number of bourbons, except to say that “it would have been a lot”.  
      
       
     16 In later answers Mr. Stephens explains that, having walked from Mario’s to the Jindabyne Hotel, he continued to drink bourbon at the latter place; being unable to say how many such drinks he consumed except to say that “they were flowing at a pretty steady, steady pace”. 
      
       
     17 In the answers immediately following, Mr. Stephens explains that at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel he met up with his brother, Daniel, the appellant, and “Pep”. He describes “Pep” as having been wearing “……….. a white, white T-shirt ………..maybe”. As to anything then unusual about the appearance of “Pep”, he says: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well, he just sort of had, had his, actually I, I can’t remember, he was wearing a sling but I’m not sure whether he was wearing it out, out, out at night. I can’t recall.” 
         
        
       
     18 The interviewing police then turned their questioning to an incident said to have occurred at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel while Mr. Stephens, his brother, the appellant and “Pep” were there. It is put to Mr. Stephens that the police information is that one of the group which included Mr. Stephens had fallen over smashing a glass, and had been thereupon removed by one Dave Ivorac, a security staff member. The upshot of this portion of the questioning is that Mr. Stephens tells the police that he can remember the incident, but cannot remember the identity of the person who caused the incident by smashing the glass, although he believes it could have been a person named Brett Vale whom he describes as “……………… a tall blonde-haired guy”. 
      
       
     19 The questioning then turns to the course of events at the Aspen Hotel. Mr. Stephens says that he went to the Aspen Hotel, as best he can recall the fact, in company with a man called Chris Hillier; and that he sat quietly with Mr. Hillier in the hotel drinking bourbon and talking. 
      
       
     20 At question 172 and following the police questioning turns to the subject of the scuffle which Mr. Stephens had previously said he had witnessed inside the Aspen Hotel. His relevant answers are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.172 Can you tell me a bit more about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Troy, Toy[sic] had some, another group of friends there, that were playing pool and I think they were playing against this Clinton guy and that, that other, what was that blond haired guy’s name? 
         
        
        
         
         Q.173 At this stage I would rather not let you know the names of the person involved.

         A. Well, they, they were playing pool against those guys and, and those guys were, were I don’t know, they were getting a bit aggro, and I don’t know, they were sort of, giving, giving these, these other, these guys a, these friends of Troy’s a, a hard time and, yeah, they were going, going crazy. And then, I don’t know, I just sort of looked, looked over there and, and saw you know the, the tension, there was a lot of tension there and then I, I turned back to Chris and just kept, kept on talking to him when, when, when the fight broke, broke out there.  
         
        
        
         
         Q.175 What did you actually see when you saw the fight break out? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t, I didn’t see it start. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.176 O.K. 
         
        
        
         
         A. I saw it in, in progress and I sort of just turned around and, yeah, it was just a you know, just a blur of …………….. and I sort of just jumped up and pushed, pushed two people away from each other.  
         
        
        
         
         Q.177 Who were the two people you pushed away from each other? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I, I believe one was this, this, this blond haired guy and I, I don’t know who, who the other person was, and that was that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.178 And then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And then the security guys, or the bouncers from, from the Aspen broke it up and kicked Troy out and I just pretty much sat, sat back down and continued drinking with, well, finished, finished my drink with Chris. Chris was playing his harmonica and sort of cruising around, yeah.  
         
        
        
         
         Q.179 When you say Troy was kicked out, what do you mean by that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, the, the bouncers, one of them said he had to, had to go. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.180 And what happened. 
         
        
        
         
         A. He went, well, I, I think him and his mates, Dan, Pep, they, they all split. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.181 Sorry, could you speak up?

         A. No, they were the only, only ones I really knew. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.188 Do you know them by sight or by name? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, not really, I don’t think I’ve ever, ever seen them before and I didn’t really take much notice of them anyhow because they were, they were in their own, own little group there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.189 And at the time that the security staff was escorting Troy out, did you hear them say anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.190 How far away from Troy were you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, he was on, they, they were on the other side of the pool tables, so they would have been five metres away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.191 Was there any music playing at the time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.192 Could you hear any voices on the other side of the room?

         Q.193 Pardon?

         Q.195 ------- were asked to leave the hotel? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I wasn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.196 I’ve been informed that security staff actually escorted yourself and Dan out of the hotel. Is there anything you can tell me about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I would say it’s not, not true at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.197 I’ve also been informed that --------------

         Q.198 Do you know why there is any reason why the security staff would, would tell us that they asked yourself and Dan to leave the hotel and escorted you from the hotel. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I can’t, can’t understand that at all. I mean, yeah, it’s news to me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.199 I’ve been informed that whilst Troy was being escorted from the hotel, he used words similar to, ‘Come outside and we’ll find out what sort of a man you are.’ 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.200 Do you know anything about that?

         Q.202 What do you mean by that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well he had, he had a nick on his eye. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.203 For the tape we’ll just note that you were using your finger to touch the eyebrow of your right eye. Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, right or left.

         Q.205 Was that on the right or left side? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.206 Do you remember what Pep was wearing. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I thought he had a white T-shirt on, I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.207 Anything else? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No probably would have had a parker [sic] or jacket of some sort. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.208 Where were you when Pep had to go and clean himself up? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was just sitting talking to Chris.” 
         
        
       
     21 Mr. Stephens goes on to say that he left the Aspen Hotel by himself, his companion, Mr. Hillier, having gone to get a taxi. Mr. Stephens says that he was sitting and talking to people named Graham Kay and Richard Boyce; and he says that they would be able to verify what he has told the police about having been in their company. The interviewing police put to Mr. Stephens that both those named persons have been interviewed and have informed the police that Mr. Stephens was “actually asked to leave the hotel”. Mr. Stephens responds that he cannot understand why they would have said such a thing.  
      
       
     22 At questions 223 and following, the police questioning turns to the events outside the Aspen Hotel. Mr. Stephens gives, initially, this version: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.223 And when you walked out of the hotel, didn’t you see anyone? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, not, not really, probably said, said good-bye to Boycy and Graham and those guys, and then walked out round the corner where, where I saw, saw this guy Clinton running, running into, attack Troy.” 
         
        
       
     23 Mr. Stephens goes on to say that Mr. Portelli was about 50 metres away from him at that point; and that Mr. Hansen was about 10 or 20 metres behind Mr. Portelli; both Mr. Portelli and Mr. Hansen having come out of “the back alleyway” near the Aspen Hotel. Mr. Stephens says that, at that particular point in the course of events, there were “about eight” other people with, or in the near vicinity of, the appellant; and that his recollection of them is that: “……….. there was a whole heap of friends of Troy’s that I, I didn’t know. I think they were friends of Troy’s, I, I don’t really know. But there was Dan there, there was Pep there”.  
      
       
     24 The questioning then continues: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.245 Can you tell me where Dan and Pep were in relation to Troy? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, no, I can’t, but I can only, you know, say that, that they were there, because they, they left with, with Ben, but, you know, I couldn’t really see. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.246 Do you know where the other people were in relation to Dan, Troy and Pep? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, it just, just seemed like there was just a group, a big group of them and with, with this guy running, running towards them. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.247 And what did you think when you saw this person Clint running towards Troy? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I thought, what the hell is he doing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.248 How did that make you feel? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I thought this, well, I thought this guy is just crazy, what’s he doing, he’s running into, I, I, I didn’t, didn’t really know what to think. I was just probably having enough trouble walking up the street. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.249 Were you worried about what might happen with this person running towards Troy? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I, I didn’t know, no, I didn’t really know what, what to think. I was, yeah, you know, I didn’t know whether, whether he had something or what, what, what he was thinking, but he was, from, from seeing him earlier, earlier on inside the, the guy was, seemed to be really highly strung and was very volatile and, yeah, I don’t know, well, I don’t know what he was on, you know, he was - 
         
        
        
         
         Q.250 Having that in mind, did you feel that there may be a fight between Clint and Troy? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, yeah, I thought, I thought something was going to happen like, this guy was charging in at a, at a rampant pace. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.251 Did you see what happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I did but there was people in, in the, in the way and I, I don’t really know, you know, what, what I saw. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.252 Can you try and describe to me what you saw? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, there just seemed to be just a, just a blur of stumbling, and, you know, people falling over, tripping over each other, standing back up, tripping over. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.253 Did you see anyone exchange blows? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, not really. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.254 Punches or kicks? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.255 So, is it the case that you saw people falling over each other? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was just, yeah, yeah, it was just like a, I don’t know, just shadows rumbling. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.256 What did you do then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I, I continued walking, walking up in that, that direction and when, when I sort of arrived up there this, this guy Clinton was unconscious on, on the ground and I, I walked up to him and rolled him over to see if he was alright and he was, he was sort of snoring and, and there was still sort of scuffling going on between, between the police and, and, and this other blond haired guy, and then, then, then I just kept going. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.257 Can you tell me where Troy, Dan and Pep were at, at that stage? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, when, when I’d sort of walked up there, I suppose Troy, Troy was back from the, from the, from the crowd, I don’t know where, where it, it just sort of everyone, everyone was just sort of bouncing around, I don’t know, just looking pretty, pretty freaked out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.258 Can you tell me where Troy, Dan and Pep were standing in relation to the person on the ground, Clinton, at the time that ----- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, there was no one around him. I was the only, only one near, near his, his vicinity.” 
         
        
       
     25 There is a deal more material to the same effect; but its essential present relevance is that Mr. Stephens reiterates on a number of occasions that he did not have a really clear view of exactly what was going on in the scuffling earlier described; that he doesn’t know “whether there, maybe, maybe there was a, was there, was there, I don’t even know whether there was a bus there or something that may, may have blocked, blocked my vision or, or what it was, but, that was that. ……….. .”; and that, emphatically, he did not see Mr. Portelli and Mr. Hansen knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked about the head and body. Mr. Stephens goes on to explain that he approached Mr. Portelli where the latter was lying on the ground; noticed certain injuries to Mr. Portelli; and that, as to any concern on his own part that Mr. Portelli had been assaulted, he was not really so concerned because “………….. you know, I saw him, you know, he could have quite easily walked, walked down, down the back alleyway, like, I thought it was insane for him to charge into, into a group of, you know, eight, eight or 10, 10 guys when, when he was quite a, you know, small sort of guy. He quite easily could have, could have walked down that back alleyway and, and had nothing to do with it. You know, he sort of chose to attack, you know, a group, a group of guys, so. But I certainly felt, you know, remorse but he, he was breathing heavily and seemed to be in a, he was unconscious, but – “. 
      
       
     26 Further questions are asked, later in the interview, about Mr. Stephens’ observations of events inside the Aspen Hotel; and he answers to the effect that he was about 5 metres away, “across the room”, at the time Mr. Portelli began to act aggressively, and at the time of the flaring up of the subsequent scuffle inside the Aspen Hotel. Shortly after these particular passages, the interview turns to Mr. Stephens’ actions after the incident outside the Aspen Hotel. He gives this account: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.342 When did you next speak to Dan and Pep? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That would have been Saturday afternoon. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.343 Did you speak with them about this incident? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.344 What were you told? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Basically, what, what I told you, that was, I don’t think there was, you know, much, much more information there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.345 When you spoke to Dan and Pep about this incident, did they tell you what they did, if anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, Dan, Dan told me that he, that he, you know, tried, tried to, well, he was just trying to break, break it up, and, yeah, that was about, about it from Dan. Pep, Pep, well, didn’t really say much at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.346 Did Dan tell you that he’d punched anyone? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.347 Did Pep tell you that he punched anyone? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, he didn’t tell us that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.348 Did either of them tell you, tell you that they had kicked anyone? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.349 And since this incident have you spoken with Troy Gibson about it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.350 What did Troy tell, tell you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Nothin’, really, just said, you know, that he had, you know, tripped over, the guy was attacking him and he tried to, tried to fend him off and ended up tripping over, I think, the, the other guy and he just said that he, he sort of fell, fell back and was, was out of there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.351 Did Troy tell you that he had punched or kicked any of the persons? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     27 There follows some fairly close police questioning of Mr. Stephens as to why he had not come forward earlier and given the investigating police such information as he had concerning the incidents inside and outside the Aspen Hotel. In the course of that questioning, the interviewing police put to Mr. Stephens some things allegedly said by him to another witness whom the police had previously interviewed. The relevant questions and answers are: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.397 Then you had a conversation with Mr. Ivorac, where you say that Dan gets a bit out of control and punched a couple of people. 
         
        
        
         
         A. I, I don’t think I said that at all. In fact I think that was, that was wrong, because the, the whole thing that Dan told me, well, I didn’t see it, is that he was trying to break it up the whole time, inside and outside. So, I don’t believe he, I would have said that at, at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.398 Can you think of any reason why these people would tell us these conversations in the manner in which they’ve told us and the substance of which they’ve told us. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, no. I can’t think for any reason, pretty much, you know, just, trying, trying to piece together what, what happened ourselves I suppose. It was really, you know, I really had no idea what, what was going on, and you know, probably a lot of information that, that I’ve given you has been accumulated from, from these conversations.” 
         
        
       
     28 There are then some further questions put to Mr. Stephens about his failure to come forward earlier with whatever information he was able to give the investigating police; and these further questions elicit the following response: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.400 Do you think that the information you had is important? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I didn’t, didn’t really think so. I, I thought, you know, that, that this guy, like, really, brought, brought it on him, on himself, and you know, I thought, you know he had the choice of, of walking down that, that alleyway, or charging into, into a, you know, group, group of guys, and, you know, I didn’t really, really think of it, you know, it had anything to do with me. I thought there was a lot of people standing round there, that, that’d seen, seen more that what, what I saw, and you know, what I saw, through, through my blurry eyes was, I don’t know, you know, how true or how, what it was that I saw. It was very, you know, difficult to, to remember, very difficult to, to even ------ even see, see what was happening. I don’t know what, what time the, it took place or, but I can imagine it was pretty late and – .” 
         
        
       
     29 After some further questioning, the interview proper with Mr. Stephens concludes with his agreeing to take part in an identification parade, should it be possible to arrange one; and to be photographed by the police to the end of that photograph being shown, in an undifferentiated group of photographs, to potential identification witnesses. 
      
       
     30 Relevant for present purposes is the following sequence taken from the post-interview questioning of Mr. Stephens by the police officer then in charge of the police station: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.443 Have you, have the answers you have given in this interview been made of your own free will? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, I believe so, yeah, I was perhaps pressured into, to making statements that I was unsure about but basically, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         ……………………………………………………………….. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.449 And do, and what do you mean by pressure, like --- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, you know, you know just ----- 
         
        
        
         
         Q.449 ------- 
         
        
        
         
         A. A, a lot of things I, I was very uncertain about. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.450 Mm. 
         
        
        
         
         A. I saw it in a, I don’t know what, some ungodly hour through, through drunken eyes in, in the dark and ----------- 
         
        
        
         
         Q.451 All right. 
         
        
        
         
         A. ---------------and I, I just felt that they were trying to be so specific, but I just wasn’t, wasn’t able to, to verify, yes or no, or, or whatever, because I just didn’t really see the incident -------- 
         
        
        
         
         Q.452 Alright. 
         
        
        
         
         A. ----------- as clearly as, as they would have liked me to have seen it, or wanted me to see it.” 
         
        
        
        
       
     · The Potential Evidence of Guy Stephens: The Interview on 25 February 2002 with the Crown Prosecutor 
      
       
     31 Extensive notes were made either by the Crown Prosecutor or by the Crown Prosecutor’s instructing officer of the detail of this conference. 
      
       
     32 The recorded answers of Mr. Stephens confirmed that he had been drinking heavily during the relevant period. He says at one point during the conference that, at the time at which he saw Mr. Portelli and Mr. Hansen running towards the group outside the Aspen Hotel, he, Mr. Stephens, was well affected by alcohol; that he could have had, by that stage, something like 26 drinks; that his actual recollection of Mr. Portelli running up to the group is “hazy”, and that he “(c)ould not really see what was happening when he came to the group”. 
      
       
     33 According to the conference notes, Mr. Stephens, when he arrived at the Aspen Hotel, saw inside that hotel his brother, the appellant, and Mr. Hillier. He saw also two girls playing pool, but did not know who they were. There were “two guys” at the pool table; they were “harassing the girls”; the girls were “annoyed with them”, and “indicated by hand gestures: Leave us alone.”. Mr. Stephens himself was “about 10 feet” away from that scene and was “looking the other way”. He heard a commotion; saw that there was a fight in progress but “…..did not know which guy did what. It was not Troy or Dan. One guy was a blonde-haired guy and one was Craig Hansen”. Mr. Stephens tried to separate the fighters; and Mr. Hansen “tried to pull me down with him”, ripping his shirt in the process. According to Mr. Stephens, the appellant “was over the other side” and “(t)he only person I could say for sure was fighting, was Craig”. 
      
       
     34 Mr. Stephens is recorded in the notes as having said that he could see Mr. Portelli “breathing heavily” with pupils “fully dilated”. Mr. Portelli was visible “over Hansen’s shoulder. They were about 10 feet away”. As to the course of that particular fight, Mr. Stephens is recorded as having said that Mr. Portelli and Mr. Hansen “were out of control”; that, after his own encounter with Mr. Hansen and the tearing of his shirt, everything “settled down”; and that security guards told the appellant “and the other guys” to leave, which they did, walking out the front door of the hotel. At that stage, according to the conference notes, Mr. Stephens was talking to Mr. Hansen and to Mr. Portelli who thanked him for breaking up the fight. The doorman then “kicked them out the back”. He himself walked out the front door of the hotel, made his way to Thredbo Terrace, and then saw Mr. Portelli “running on his own up the hill shadowed by Craig Hansen”.  
      
       
     35 According to the notes, Mr. Stephens reaffirmed his dispute about his supposed conversation with Mr. Iverach; answered affirmatively a question: “You strongly support your brother?”; and in answer to a question: “Do you think you have a bias in support of your brother?”, is recorded as having answered: “I wanted to be truthful. I was the first person to get to the wounded guy. I turned him over on his side to make sure his airway was clear.”. 
      
       
        
        
       
     · The Decision of the Crown Prosecutor not to call Guy Stephens: relevant events at trial 
      
       
     36 On 4 March 2002, the fourth day of the trial, there was a major forensic confrontation concerning the calling of Guy Stephens as a witness in the Crown case. The relevant exchanges occupy some 16 pages of trial transcript. It is convenient, for present purposes, to begin with the following submissions put by the Crown Prosecutor: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the Kneebone matter, I was able to obtain the case. I would just like to place on the record some facts that are pertinent to the course of the trial. In a correspondence directed to the solicitor for public prosecutions, the learned counsel for the accused Mr. Gibson inquired whether or not the Crown would call a person by the name of Guy Stephens who was present at the Aspen Hotel in the early hours of the morning on 1 August 1998. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour is aware that this matter was listed for trial in November of last year and it is my instructions that Mr. Stephens was not available at that time in November. He was subsequently, to my knowledge, found by police investigating this matter on the last Friday – the Friday before the nominated Monday commencement of this trial. I think that was about 15 February. He was subsequently requested to attend Sydney for the purposes of this trial and when police spoke to him they served him with a subpoena to secure his attendance. 
         
        
        
         
         I think it wasn’t the 15th, it was 22 February because last Monday was the day that I held the conference, which was the following Monday after him being located on the Friday. On last Monday, 25 February, I held a conference with him in my chambers in the presence of my instructing solicitor, ……………… . During the course of that conference certain questions were put to him and answers were made. As a result of that conference, I formed a view that the Crown would not call him on the basis of his unreliability, untruthfulness and otherwise incredible witness. 
         
        
        
         
         It goes beyond his account being merely inconsistent with another witness. I have been anxious to put these matters on the record in a timely fashion. I can indicate that the witness remains under subpoena if he is required to be called by either of the defence counsel. If your Honour wishes me to go into the reasons why I have formed that view, there are some particular reasons that I can expand on, if that’s required.” 
         
        
       
     37 The learned trial Judge indicated that her Honour did not see the need for any such expanded reasons.  
      
       
     38 Learned counsel then appearing for the present appellant, (not being learned Senior Counsel who argued the appeal on behalf of the appellant), then addressed on the issue. The kernel of counsel’s argument appears, as it seems to me, in the following submissions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Can I say that Guy Stephens’s account not only is, prima facie, consistent and truthful, but it is also exculpatory in many respects of Troy Gibson, and incriminatory of a man called ‘Pep’, who I apprehend Mr. Scott doesn’t even believe exists. He’s the informant of the case. I refer specifically to Mr. Scott’s answers on that particular issue in the voir dire.” 
         
        
       
     39 The lengthy and strenuous submissions of defence counsel focused essentially upon the following propositions: first, that no satisfactory explanation had been given by the Crown Prosecutor for her decision not to call Guy Stephens as a witness in the Crown case; secondly, that section 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 provided, in any event, every proper protection for the fair and complete presentation of the Crown case should Guy Stephens be called as a witness in that case; thirdly, that the Crown Prosecutor had a so-called “case theory” and was shaping the Crown case, deliberately and improperly, so as to fit that preconceived theory; fourthly, that, were Guy Stephens not to be called as a witness in the Crown case, a miscarriage of justice would inevitably follow in the case of the present appellant; and fifthly, that given the foregoing considerations, it was up to the learned trial Judge to do something herself in order to avoid such a miscarriage of justice. Various proposals were canvassed in this latter connection; but it is not necessary now to consider them in detail. 
      
       
     40 Counsel for the appellant’s then co-accused, having indicated that he was not intending to call Guy Stephens or to seek to tender the electronically recorded interview between that person and the investigating police, learned counsel appearing for the appellant made further submissions. The conclusion of those submissions put, in relation to the calling of evidence from Guy Stephens, the following propositions: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am going to press this evidence, as I am instructed to do – I know ……………… (counsel at trial for the co-accused Mr. Daniel Stephens) ………….. has addressed on the record his concerns about it – so I am just flagging that I intend to press the evidence. If my friend is not going to call him, then we will call him. The implications on ………….. (the co-accused’s counsel’s) …………… is something that may yet have to be canvassed. I am making that clear for ………….. (the co-accused’s counsel) …………”. 
         
        
       
     41 During the course of submissions, and after the appellant’s co-accused’s counsel had indicated his attitude towards the calling of Guy Stephens, learned counsel for the appellant pressed once again for an expanded explanation from the Crown Prosecutor of her decision not to call Guy Stephens as a witness in the Crown case. The Crown Prosecutor then made the following statement: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can say in broad terms I formed the view that he was – and I want to go to the words – unreliable, untrustworthy and otherwise incapable of belief. In general he has given inconsistent accounts. He agreed that his level of intoxication was indeed such that he had had more than 26 glasses of alcohol during that evening and one of his aims that evening was to get as much alcohol into himself as possible, that his recollection was hazy, and vague, that he had spoken to a lot of people in town about these events and people who had been interviewed by the police, and that the Crown formed the view that he had a clear allegiance to the accused Mr. Daniel Stephens. For those reasons, after a conference held on 25 February 2002, I formed the view that he would be an unreliable, untrustworthy witness and incapable of being put forward to the jury as a witness of truth.” 
         
        
       
     42 On the following morning, 5 March 2002, learned trial counsel for the appellant returned to the issue. Counsel made an application that the trial be stayed temporarily until the Crown indicated that it would call Guy Stephens as a witness in the Crown case.  
      
       
     43 Opening his submissions in support of the application, counsel said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “……………………………………… (I)n my respectful submission the only possible reason for failure to call Guy Stephens is a tactical advantage. That is an improper basis on which to fail to call someone who on all the information we have, is wanting to be truthful and capable of giving an eye-witness account and was some way involved in the first fight inside the pub. He was present and observant in relation to the altercation outside the public house and who says in response to the Crown question – Do you think you have a bias, as in support of your brother? I want to be truthful - prima facie his record of interview is, with respect, truthful. 
         
        
        
         
         My friend, I can hear, is obviously concerned about my assertion there is an improper tactical advantage being sought here but on the information we have and your Honour has there can be no other proper inference and to that extent that is an improper basis on which to fail to call Guy Stephens. ………………………: 
         
        
       
     44 As counsel developed his submissions, it was suggested to him by the learned trial Judge that Guy Stephens, even if not called as a witness in the Crown case, was available, nevertheless, to be called in the appellant’s own case. Counsel resisted strenuously any such suggestion. He explained as follows what he saw as being the unfairness of his being put in such a position: 
      
       
        
         
         “If my friend wants to adhere to this particular decision, then the only other way – if your Honour is not minded to grant the application – then the only other situation is to separate the two accused in the dock, so at the end of the day evidence admissible to Troy Gibson’s defence, but opposed by ………(counsel for the co-accused) ……., can be run in the ordinary course of events. 
         
        
        
         
         The difficulty of calling Guy Stephens where only one accused is involved is far less than the difficulty of an injustice that will arise in calling him, sandwiched as we are between a Crown who says that he is unreliable, and counsel for Daniel Stephens who obviously does not favour the reception of the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Can I suggest, and I don’t know his instructions, but there is absolutely nothing on the papers to suggest that he is unreliable, certainly not more so than any other witness who was there that night drinking in the way we can see.” 
         
        
       
     45 These submissions drew from the Crown Prosecutor the following response: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will just repeat the situation that I had a lengthy conference, lengthy in terms of approximately half-an-hour to 45 minutes, with Mr. Guy Stephens on 25 February 2002 in the presence of my instructing solicitor. I had in fact the case of Kneebone with me. I made reference to that case in the conduct of the interview. 
         
        
        
         
         I took Mr. Guy Stephens to various aspects of his interview and various other aspects of the events of the night.  
         
        
        
         
         I tested him in relation to some aspects of his recollection.  
         
        
        
         
         I asked him particular questions, and after that conference I conferred with my instructing solicitor and I came to the view that I put forward yesterday, for the various reasons that I outlined, including internally inconsistent accounts with other eye-witnesses, excessive level of intoxication and inconsistency, that his recollection was vague and hazy, an assertion that he was supporting his brother, an account which included conferring with various other people and listening to town scuttle-butt. 
         
        
        
         
         In addition your Honour to those matters, there was also a view based on the witness’s general demeanour and attitude, and it’s my respectful submission in forming the judgment that I am entitled and must come to, in forming my decision whether or not to call a witness in the Crown case I took those matters into account, including his demeanour and attitude, and I formed a view that the witness was not capable or was not a witness that the Crown could put forward confidently as a witness of truth, that his recollection was unreliable, his account was untrustworthy, and I made a considered and deliberate decision in carrying out my obligations according to the law and according to the Bar Association rules which bind me as a Crown Prosecutor, and I reject the suggestion by my learned friend that I engaged in a tactical manoeuvre.” 
         
        
        
        
       
     · The Decision of the Crown Prosecutor not to call Guy Stephens: Relevant Principles 
      
       
     46 These are stated definitively for Australian Courts by the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Apostilides  (1984) CLR 563. The propositions of particular relevance in the present case are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The Crown prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown. 
         
        
        
         
          ………………………………………. 
         
        
        
         
         6. A decision of the prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness will only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.”  
         [154 CLR 575] 
         
        
       
     47 These two basic propositions are further developed and explained by the High Court as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “We have not attempted in our first proposition to deal exhaustively with the responsibility of the prosecutor. The description of that responsibility, …………….., emphasises that the prosecutor’s role in this regard is a lonely one, the nature of which is such that it cannot be shared with the trial judge without placing in jeopardy the essential independence of that office in the adversary system. It is not only a lonely responsibility but also a heavy one. A decision whether or not to call a person whose name appears on the indictment and from whom the defence wish to lead evidence must be made with due sensitivity to the dictates of fairness towards an accused person. A refusal to call the witness will be justified only by reference to the overriding interests of justice. Such occasions are likely to be rare. The unreliability of the evidence will only suffice where there are identifiable circumstances which clearly establish it; it will not be enough that the prosecutor merely has a suspicion about the unreliability of the evidence. In most cases where a prosecutor does not wish to lead evidence from a person named on the indictment, but the defence wishes that person to be called, it will be sufficient for the prosecutor simply to call the person so that he may be cross-examined by the defence and then, if necessary, be re-examined.  
         
        
        
         
         ……………………………………………………………………………. 
         
        
        
         
         In our formulation of the sixth proposition we have omitted .. [a] .. reference to misconduct, intending thereby to broaden the approach so as to focus directly on the consequences, objectively perceived, that the failure to call the witness has had on the course of the trial and its outcome. It is not necessary to postulate misconduct of the prosecutor as an essential condition precedent to a miscarriage of justice. No doubt in the great majority of cases of this kind an appellate tribunal which finds a miscarriage of justice to have occurred will trace that miscarriage to a wrong exercise of judgment by the prosecutor which led to the witness not being called. In cases where there has been no error of judgment there will be less likelihood of a miscarriage resulting from the failure to call the witness. Nevertheless, the absence of testimony from a witness may lead to a miscarriage of justice without any error having occurred. …………………………………… So, if a prosecutor fails to call a witness whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the case for the Crown the central question is not whether his decision constitutes misconduct but whether in all the circumstances the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory.” [154 CLR, 577, 578] 
         
        
       
     48 The foregoing propositions were the subject of examination and comment by a Bench of this Court, (Spigelman CJ, Greg James J and Smart AJ), in R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450. It was this decision to which reference was continuously made in the shorthand form “Kneebone” during the course of the relevant submissions at trial. During the course of argument at the hearing of the present appeal, there was comment to the effect that the decision in Kneebone can be regarded as having expanded further the propositions established by the decision in Apostilides. As at present advised, I am not persuaded that such is the case; but I do not think that it is necessary to become embroiled in that particular technical argument. The fact is that as matters stand the guiding Australian authority is the decision of the High Court in Apostilides; and I see no reason to travel for present purposes beyond the propositions of law there established by the High Court. 
      
       
     49 I do think, however, that for present purposes it is useful, in applying the Apostilides principles, to bear in mind something said by the Privy Council in a recent advising: Randall v The Queen [2002] 1 WLR 2237 at 2243: 
      
       
        
         
         “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that these are not the rules of a game. They are rules designed to safeguard the fairness of proceedings brought to determine whether a defendant is guilty of committing a crime or crimes, conviction of which may expose him to serious penal consequences. In a criminal trial as in other activities the observance of certain basic rules has been shown to be the most effective safeguard against unfairness, error and abuse.” 
         
        
       
     50 The gravamen of the present appeal being the proposition that there has been in fact a miscarriage of justice, it is useful to re-affirm what is meant by that expression. 
      
       
     51 The relevant principles are conveniently examined by the High Court of Australia in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465, and in particular in the joint judgment of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 371-373. It is there explained that there are, broadly speaking, two types of situation apt to be described as a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     52 First, there is the case of a trial, the conduct of which has involved an error so fundamental that it can be said reasonably that “…….. the proceedings before the primary court have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all”. Error of this kind is “radical or fundamental”. It entails an irregularity “….. which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings”. In a case of this kind, it is not necessary to establish anything beyond the fact of the “radical or fundamental” error, in order to establish a miscarriage of justice. Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, examining and explaining this particular type of miscarriage of justice, say: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error. It may go either to the form of the trial or the manner in which it was conducted. ………………… In the end no mechanical approach can be adopted and each case must be determined upon its own circumstances.” 
         
        
       
     53 Secondly, is the case of a trial in which there has been “a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial”, and it cannot be said that the particular appellant has thereby not lost, quoting from other and earlier decisions of the High Court, “a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted”, or “a real chance of acquittal”. Of this particular type of miscarriage of justice, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ say: 
      
       
        
         
         “Unless it can be said that, had there been no blemish in the trial, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused, the conviction must be set aside ………………… . Unless that can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence strictly followed ……………. The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case.”

       Festa v The Queen  
       [2001] HCA 72 (13 December 2001). 
        
       
     · The Decision of the Crown Prosecutor not to call Guy Stephens: has the Appellant demonstrated a Miscarriage of Justice? 
      
       
     54 Two aspects of this question can be despatched, in my opinion, in short order.  
      
       
     55 First, any criticism of the conduct at trial of the Crown Prosecutor, being criticism which amounts in substance to an accusation of professional misconduct on her part, should be, in my opinion, firmly rejected. The reasoning of the Crown Prosecutor was fully exposed in her submissions to the learned trial Judge. There is, so far as I can see, no evidence whatsoever from which there could be drawn a rational inference that any part of what was thus said by the Crown Prosecutor was untruthful. Neither, so far as I can see, is there any evidence from which it would be possible to draw a rational inference of improper motive; or of deliberate unfairness or impropriety of any other kind. 
      
       
     56 Secondly, the material before this Court could not support, in my opinion, a rational conclusion that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the sense that “the proceedings before the primary court have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all”. 
      
       
     57 The question now to be decided becomes, thus, whether the appellant has demonstrated that the fact that Guy Stephens was not called at all at the trial entails that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that, had Mr. Stephens been called, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would not inevitably have found the appellant guilty on counts 2 and 3 of the indictment.  
      
       
     58 Before embarking upon that assessment which the law requires this Court now to make of the facts of the appellant’s particular case, it is expedient to note the following matters: 
      
       
        
       [1] Mr. Portelli, one of the victims, was called at trial; but was unable, because of post-traumatic amnesia, to give any useful evidence in connection with the events of 1 August 1998. 
        
        
       [2] Fundamental to the exercise is a particular assessment of the evidence which it is reasonable to suppose Mr. Guy Stephens could and would have given had he been called as a witness at trial. The making of that particular assessment by this Court is no easy task. All that the Court has is a transcript of Mr. Stephens’ electronically recorded interview with the police; and a transcription of the notes taken in connection with the Crown Prosecutor’s interview on 25 February last. All that this Court can do is to proceed upon the assumption that Mr. Stephens, had he been called as a witness at trial, could and would have given evidence to the effect of his statements in the two interviews.  
        
        
       [3] An assessment of the contents of the transcript of the police interview presents a number of difficulties. The police questioning is, as it seems to me, poorly structured. Mr. Stephens’ recorded answers are for the most part barely articulate. It seems that the interview was electronically recorded, as it progressed, on audio tapes but not on video tapes. This Court has not heard the audio tapes themselves played. It is, therefore, impossible for this Court to come to any rational conclusion about the demeanour of Mr. Stephens throughout his interview; or about the potentially very important question whether his apparent inarticulateness is a mark of evasiveness; or is the mark, merely, of natural nervousness; or, indeed, is the result of some actual speech impediment. 
        
        
       [4] Much the same can be said about the present assessment by this Court of the contents of the conference notes of February last. The notes themselves are, understandably, cast in a very summary form. There is no way for this Court to assess for itself whether it shares the adverse view taken by the Crown Prosecutor of Mr. Stephens’ demeanour during the course of the conference. 
        
        
       [5] Had Mr. Stephens been called as a witness at trial, the impact of his evidence might have depended significantly upon the way in which his evidence was elicited.  
        
        
        Had the Crown called Mr. Stephens, either as a witness in the Crown case or for the purpose only of presenting him for cross-examination by counsel for the two accused, it is safe to say that it would not have taken the jury very long to understand that the Crown was not putting Mr. Stephens forward as a witness of truth; an impression likely to have been reinforced by the practically certain need for the Crown to seek leave to cross-examine its witness pursuant to section 38 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       . It is not likely that the jury’s view of Mr. Stephens, as a witness of truth, or as a reliable witness, would have been enhanced by two further cross-examinations by counsel appearing, respectively, for the two co-accused.  
        
       
     59 Bearing in mind all of the foregoing considerations, my relevant assessment is: 
      
       
        
       [1] The significant questions which were controversial at the trial, and as to which it is relevant to consider what evidence Mr. Guy Stephens could have given had he been called as a witness at trial, are:  
        
        
        (1) What caused the fight inside the Aspen Hotel? 
        
        
        (2) Who struck the first blow? 
        
        
        (3) Who struck, thereafter, what blows to whom? 
        
        
        (4) How was that fight brought to an end? 
        
        
         
         (5) What were the relevant movements thereafter of any of the persons who were involved in the later fight in Thredbo Crescent? 
         
        
        
        (6) What caused that fight to break out? 
        
        
        (7) Who struck the first blow? 
        
        
        (8) Who struck any blow(s) to either Mr. Portelli or Mr Hansen? 
        
        
       [2] A fair reading of the recorded interview, and the conference notes of February last, suggests that Mr. Stephens could not say anything useful about the questions numbered above (2), (3), (7) and (8). 
        
        
       [3] As to the question numbered (1), it seems to me that Mr. Stephens cannot say anything more than he says in his answer to question 174 in his recorded interview: that is to say, that his best recollection is that immediately before the outbreak of the fight inside the Aspen Hotel there was  
       “a lot of tension” 
       ; and that the tension derived from some aggressive interaction between Messrs. Portelli and Hansen, on the one hand, and the appellant and his friends, on the other hand. It was not controversial at the trial that things had been somewhat tense immediately prior to the outbreak of the scuffle inside the Aspen Hotel. What was controversial at the trial is what actually triggered the undoubted exchange of blows that occurred inside the hotel. It seems to me that Mr. Stephens, upon a fair reading of the interview and conference notes, has nothing precise to say on this topic. 
        
        
       [4] As to the question numbered (4), it is fair to say that Mr. Stephens gives in his recorded interview a version of his having assisted to break up the initial scuffle. According to Mr. Stephens, he actually shook hands with both Messrs. Portelli and Hansen, both of whom thanked him for his assistance in breaking up the scuffle. That material, if accepted, does not seem to me to strengthen the version given by the appellant in his evidence of the course of events in connection with the scuffle inside the Aspen Hotel. The way in which Mr. Stephens describes the relevant sequence is as consistent, in my opinion, with Messrs. Portelli and Hansen not having been the aggressors, as it is consistent with the contrary inference.  
        
        
       [5] As to the question numbered (5), the appellant’s own version was that he was  
       “grabbed around the waist” 
        and pulled back, he thought by  
       “a bouncer” 
       , from the melee then in progress on the floor of the Aspen Hotel. The appellant says that:  
       “I was saying ‘look, mate, it’s alright, it’s okay, you know, I’m not going to do anything,’ and he said ‘well, can you just leave the front?” 
         
        
        
        The appellant’s version was that he then walked peaceably out of the Aspen Hotel; and that, presently, another man who had been involved in the fight inside the hotel was forcibly ejected from those premises. This man was described by the appellant in his evidence as having been about 6 feet in height with blonde-coloured hair and a medium to large build. The appellant narrated in his evidence some conversation which he says that he had with this other man, but its details are not at present significant. The appellant’s version then has him standing at the front of the Aspen Hotel on what he describes as  
       “this little platform there” 
       , and  
       “trying to indicate to Jasmine and Troy  
       (sic) 
        that I was out there and I was not coming back in” 
       . The appellant’s evidence at trial was to the effect that, thereafter he began to walk home. He described his then motivation as having been:  
       “I couldn’t care less. I just wanted to go home, just finish” 
       . His evidence was that his co-accused, Mr. Guy Stephens’ brother, had caught up with him shortly after he began to walk home, and that the two of them had thereupon begun walking up the hill in Thredbo Terrace towards the point where the second, and more serious, fight subsequently erupted. 
        
        
        Mr. Guy Stephens, in his answers to questions 179 through 188, seems to be suggesting that the appellant did not walk alone out of the Aspen Hotel, but  
       “split” 
        in company with his co-accused, Mr. Daniel Stephens, the man known only as  
       “Pep” 
       , and  
       “a few, few other people”  
       who appeared to be  
       “all his mates” 
       . 
        
        
        Mr. Stephens does not give any apparent support to the appellant’s version as to his, the appellant’s, having stood outside the Aspen Hotel making signs of the kind that the appellant described in his evidence.  
        
        
       [6] As to the question numbered (6), Mr. Guy Stephens does have something to say in his recorded interview. The relevant material is contained in his answers, previously herein quoted in full, to questions 80, 223 and following, and 246 through 250. 
        
        
        The appellant’s own version in his evidence-in-chief is this: 
        
        
         
         Q. “Then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. We walked around the corner of the hotel along the side of the footpath. Up the road, I believe it is the Terrace, Thredbo Terrace, we started going up the hill. There were some other people in the pub I noticed that were walking around behind us.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you running? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, definitely not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How were you walking? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just walking at a normal pace that you do in the winter. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Go on? 
         
        
        
         
         A. We walked up along the side in between the road and the footpath there and got to the crest of the hill part where I saw two people running up the back laneway or back entrance to the shops. At first I did not really think anything of it at all and just kept on walking. As I saw them come up closer they started yelling out ‘There they are. Look who we found here’, and as they got to the top of the road as it connects just like right across there they were really running. Then I noticed there was a blonde guy and they halted from their running for a second and I saw the blonde guy looking at me and he started just charging straight at me. I scampered a little bit to the left -  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Scampered? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Stepped, where he tackled me to the ground. I wrestled with him for a little while on the ground. I was trying to get away from him. He was pretty pumped up I think and I managed to get him off or someone helped him off me and I looked over to my right where I saw this, this guy there had a green jumper on and there was a man on the ground, face on the ground, and he was jumping up and down on him with both feet. I got to my feet as quickly as I could and I just ran at this guy and pushed him, pushed him off. He was really jumping on this guy and then from there I ran back because I didn’t know what, how he would react to me pushing him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was yelling out ‘that’s enough, that’s enough’. I was yelling as hard as I could. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You looked across and saw this man. Was that the first time you had seen him in that area? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it was. I had not seen him prior to that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I ran back, well I came back and the guy that tackled me to the ground was still trying to get at me and Jason, I believe it was Jason Robinson, was holding him sort of, I don’t know, holding him or pushing him and pushing me back down the street. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were there other people around aside from the people you nominated, at that point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes there was, just in that area there would have been ten, at least ten people.” 
         
        
        
         
        
        The appellant’s version, as I read it, suggests that Messrs. Hansen and Portelli stalked and then attacked the appellant at a time when he was in the company of his co-accused, Mr. Daniel Stephens. On this version, the first act of overt aggression was that of Mr. Hansen in tackling the appellant to the ground. It is not clear from the appellant’s version how it came about thereupon that a very ugly fight erupted involving a group in the order of ten people. 
        
        
        This version does not seem to me to be supported in any significant way by the version given by Mr. Guy Stephens in his recorded interview. The latter version has, not Mr. Hansen, but Mr. Portelli charging  
       “at a rampant pace” 
       , and hurling himself in a virtual frenzy upon a much larger group of men in a fashion that caused Mr. Stephens to ask himself spontaneously:  
       “………. What the hell is he doing?” 
       . 
        
        
       [7] It seems to me that, had Mr. Guy Stephens been called as a witness at the trial, and had he given evidence generally in accord with his answers recorded during the police interview, then he would have had nothing of practical utility to say as to most of the significant questions to which I have earlier referred; and insofar as he would have said something of potential practical worth, what he would have said would not have sat comfortably with the corresponding portions of the appellant’s own evidence. 
        
        
        Had Mr. Stephens been called, and had he not adhered to his version as given to the investigating police, then, in my opinion, it would have been, to say the least, highly likely that the Crown would have been given leave to cross-examine upon the basis of the prior inconsistent statement, a procedure which was at least as likely to damage the appellant’s case as to strengthen it. It seems to me that it would have been in the highest degree likely that any such adverse effect would have been enhanced by a further cross-examination of Mr. Stephens by counsel for the appellant and for his co-accused. 
        
        
       [8] For the whole of the foregoing reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the appellant has not demonstrated that the failure to call Mr. Guy Stephens as a witness at trial entailed, in the sense earlier herein discussed, a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
     60 I would not uphold Ground 2. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
     61 The ground is: 
      
       
        
         
         “Her Honour erred in admitting evidence of the identification of the Appellant, following a confrontation between him and the witness Craig Hansen on the steps of Jindabyne Police Station, in circumstances where the witness would reasonably have believed the Appellant to be a suspect person.” 
         
        
       
     62 An extensive hearing on the voir dire was conducted by the learned trial Judge upon this issue. The relevant facts can be taken, as follows, from her Honour’s judgment on that voir dire: 
      
       
        
         
         “On 5 August 1998, Mr. Gibson attended Jindabyne Police Station with his mother and a solicitor, Mr. Marcus Galanos. There they spoke to detective David Scott, who at that stage was the officer in charge of the investigation. At the conclusion of the interview the group walked out of the police station. 
         
        
        
         
         On the voir dire the Crown called Mr. Craig Hansen, Detective David Scott and Mr. David Portelli and tendered various exhibits. Mr. Hansen and Detective ……….(Scott) …….. were extensively cross-examined. Mr. Hansen testified that having travelled from Sydney, he stopped in at the police station to check on the progress of the investigation. He was returning to work at Crackenback Resort. As he walked towards the entrance of the station he saw the accused, Troy Gibson, and recognised him ‘almost immediately’ as ‘the blonde man from the Aspen Hotel’. 
         
        
        
         
         He reported this observation to Detective Scott within minutes of entering the station. Detective Scott gave evidence that, having ushered the accused, Mr. Gibson, his mother and Mr. Galanos out of the police station, he remained standing at the front counter of the police station. He saw Mr. Hansen, who at that time was unknown to him, walk up the steps and look to his right at Mr. Gibson, who also looked to his right, apparently at Mr. Hansen. 
         
        
        
         
         When Mr. Hansen entered the police station Detective Scott asked, ‘What was that look about?’, to which Mr. Hansen replied, ‘I’m sure he’s the man who punched Clint’. Detective Scott asked, ‘Where did you see him?’. Mr. Hansen replied, ‘first inside the Aspen. He’ the blonde man who walked up to Clint and punched him outside’.  
         
        
        
         
         Mr. Portelli’s evidence, in summary, was that he did not and could not have communicated to police that Mr. Hansen was going to attend Jindabyne Police Station on 5 August 1998, as he did not know that that was the latter’s intention. 
         
        
        
         
         Counsel for the accused tendered a large number of statements and called the accused, his mother Mrs. Dianne Gibson, and his solicitor Mr. Marcus Galanos. The evidence of each of these witnesses was that no-one was seen to enter the police station at any time during the group’s visit and departure.” 
         
        
       
     63 The learned trial Judge, in her Honour’s judgment on the voir dire, notes a submission by counsel appearing at trial for the present appellant that “……………….. the question for me is not whether this encounter occurred, but whether the identification was made without Mr. Hansen having been intentionally influenced to identify the accused”. 
      
       
     64 This perception was, as I respectfully think, correct. An issue as to whether the encounter ever occurred at all was not, upon an approach correct in principle, a matter for a voir dire examination; but was a simple question of disputed fact proper to be left to the jury.  
      
       
     65 On the contained issue, as correctly defined, her Honour made findings of fact as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I accept the evidence of Mr. Hansen and Detective Scott that the former had no prior arrangement to go to the police station, and I accept Mr. Hansen’s evidence that he made a spontaneous decision to call in there on his way back from Sydney and had what was a chance encounter with the accused outside the police station.  
         
        
        
         
         Although counsel for the accused pointed to discrepancies between the evidence of Mr. Hansen and Detective Scott to found a submission that I would have real doubts about their evidence, those discrepancies, in my view, are readily explicable given the period of time which has now elapsed – namely, approximately three and a half years.  
         
        
        
         
         As I indicated earlier, both these witnesses were extensively cross-examined and both were unshaken, in my view. I am satisfied that Mr. Hansen made the identification without having been intentionally influenced and, therefore, the evidence is admissible under section 114 of the Evidence Act.” 
         
        
       
     66 In my opinion this Court could not now say reasonably that the foregoing findings of fact, made with the advantage of having seen and heard the particular witnesses, were not reasonably open to her Honour. 
      
       
     67 It became, then, necessary for her Honour to consider the effect of sections 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. Her Honour’s judgment exposes a clear and rational process of reasoning in connection with her Honour’s approach to the application of these two sections. In my opinion it has not been shown that her Honour fell into error in her analysis of the proper application to the given facts of either section 135 or section 137 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     68 I would not uphold Ground 3. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
        
       
     69 The ground is: 
      
       
        
         
         “In circumstances where there was no issue as to the fact and nature of injury suffered by the victim, Her Honour erred in admitting evidence of photographs taken of the victim in Hospital following the assault upon him, and in permitting the Crown to call the victim as a witness in the case although it was know that he had no recollection at all of the relevant events.” 
         
        
       
     70 The victim referred to in this ground is Mr. Portelli. It was not controversial at the trial that Mr. Portelli had been savagely assaulted in a way that had caused him serious injuries having serious continuing consequences for him. 
      
       
     71 As to the admissibility of the evidence of Mr. Portelli, there was a voir dire hearing in connection with which her Honour gave a judgment, part of which reads: 
      
       
        
         
         “A fact in issue in the trial is whether either of the accused was a person who was responsible for the injuries inflicted upon Mr. Portelli. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr. Portelli’s evidence is relevant to that fact in issue as it explains his inability to give any account of the events in question, including any identification of his attackers. Evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates to a favour ….[sic: but read failure]……... to adduce evidence, see section 55(2)(c) of the Evidence Act [1995]. 
         
        
        
         
         The probative value of the evidence is slight, however, there is no danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. The jury will be instructed in the summing-up that they must decide the case without sympathy or prejudice. As McHugh J said in R v Gilbert [2000] HCA 15, paragraph 31:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.’ “ 
           
          
         
        
       
     72 In my opinion this analysis was correct both in law and in fact. 
      
       
     73 As to the photographs, her Honour delivered a separate judgment in which, among other things, her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view the photographs are relevant to two facts in issue, namely, whether the injuries were inflicted with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm and, secondly, whether grievous bodily harm was inflicted on the victim. 
         
        
        
         
         The photographs are highly probative of those facts in issue. As the Court said in R v Allen, CCA, unreported 1 December 1992: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Photographs usually have a high probative value. They make clear to the jury what no amount of oral description can make clear and they are direct evidence of the injuries which they are tendered to prove.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Any danger that the photographs, if admitted, will give rise to the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused will be cured by a direction I will give to the jury before they are admitted and which I will repeat in my summing-up. 
         
        
        
         
         In my view the probative value of the photographs is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and they will be admitted into evidence. Before they are admitted I propose to give the jury what I regard to be an appropriate direction and warning as to how such photographs will be dealt with.” 
         
        
       
     74 In my opinion this approach of the learned trial Judge was correct. No present complaint is made that her Honour did not do, or did not do adequately, what she had undertaken to do in the matter of giving relevant directions to the jury. 
      
       
     75 I would not uphold Ground 4. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
     76 The Ground is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The verdict of guilty of malicious wounding (s.35 Crimes Act 1900) is unreasonable having regard to the evidence (Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.6(1) ). 
         
        
       
     77 The written submissions of the appellant indicate that the success of this ground depends upon the success of some or all of grounds 2, 3 and 4. 
      
       
     78 Since I am of the opinion that none of grounds 2, 3 and 4 has been established, it follows that, in my opinion Ground 1, also, has not been established. 
      
       
        
       The Application for Leave to Appeal against Sentence 
        
       
     79 It is convenient to quote the following extract from the written submissions of the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. Her Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the accused’s previously good character, the time delay, rehabilitation or the fact that Gibson was not the kicker. Her Honour erred in law in imposing a custodial sentence in relation to the Hansen account [sic] as such was not warranted and, in partially accumulating the sentence.” 
         
        
       
     80 It is useful to quote the following passages from the clear and careful remarks on sentence of the learned sentencing Judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offender gave evidence in the trial. He gave an account of the events preceding and on Thredbo Terrace which clearly the jury must have rejected. The offender’s culpability in this event is extremely high. Whatever else might be said about the incident inside the Aspen Hotel it was in itself quite minor. The offender had ample time to cool off after it, but he waited for the unsuspecting victims to leave in order to confront Clinton Portelli to exact revenge for some perceived slight or injustice. Not only did he wait, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he was the ringleader of this joint criminal enterprise.  
         
        
        
         
         The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he intended to cause Mr. Portelli some bodily harm. He is entitled to the full benefit of his acquittal of the more serious charge that he intended the grievous bodily harm that was inflicted. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he kicked Mr. Portelli to the head but he remained there aiding and encouraging those who did at a time when Mr. Portelli was lying defenceless on the ground as a result of his blows. This can only be described as a premeditated, cowardly and vicious attack by a larger group of at least four men on two others. The community rightly expects that those who inflict gratuitous violence on its innocent citizens will be appropriately punished. The sentences must reflect considerations of general and specific deterrence.” 
         
        
       
     81 The submissions put for the appellant do not challenge in any specific way any of those findings of fact made by her Honour. In my opinion the findings were amply open to her Honour on the whole of the evidence before her.  
      
       
     82 It is not submitted that her Honour failed to take account at all of previous good character, time delay, rehabilitation, or the fact that the appellant was not the person who actually did the kicking to Mr. Portelli’s head. What is contended, rather, is that it is plain on the face of the sentences passed upon the appellant that her Honour cannot have given proper consideration to those matters. 
      
       
     83 I do not accept that submission.  
      
       
     84 The attack on Mr. Hansen was, in the given circumstances, bad enough; but the attack upon Mr. Portelli was very much more serious. Mr. Portelli had to be brought by helicopter from Cooma to Sydney, such was the severity of the injuries inflicted upon him. He suffered a severe head injury, fractures to the right orbit and zygoma bones, fractures to the base of the skull on the right side, pneumothorax, lung contusions and anterograde and retrograde amnesia of the event. He required in-patient care at the brain injury unit at Ryde Rehabilitation Centre. 
      
       
     85 The consequences to Mr. Portelli of what was done to him were described by the learned sentencing Judge, with every justification in my opinion, as “catastrophic”. Her Honour details, in her remarks on sentence, the consequences thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “……………….. (H)e has permanent brain damage; he suffers from post-traumatic psychosis which is directly attributable to the assault and which is anticipated to be long term and which has required several admissions to a psychiatric hospital. He is on anti-psychotic medication which is anticipated to be for a long-term period. He has significant cognitive dysfunction with agitation, distractibility, reduced memory and reduced language skills. He has ongoing high level balance problems. He has changed from an independent young man working as a chef, to a man dependent on his family and unable to work in his previous occupation, or at all, since the assault. Long term parental, family, friend or agency support will be required for his accommodation, meals, clothing, finances etcetera. Doctor Norrie, his family doctor, noted his life achievement potential has been severely reduced by the assault.” 
         
        
       
     86 It must surely go without saying that an assault which produces consequences of that kind calls, even after every proper allowance is made for relevant subjective matters, for the imposition of a severe sentence. I do not think it can be said reasonably that a sentence of 4 years and 6 months is an excessive head sentence in such a context, and bearing in mind that the statutory maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years. 
      
       
     87 The submission that the learned sentencing Judge erred in law in imposing a custodial sentence at all in relation to the attack carried out on Mr. Hansen, cannot, in my opinion, be responsibly accepted. To accept that submission would be tantamount to sending a signal into the relevant parts of the community that concerted attacks upon two separate victims are no more culpable, and no more punishable, than a concerted single attack upon one only of those victims; provided only that the separate attacks take place at, or more or less at, the same time. It seems to me that such a proposition is plainly unsustainable, both as a matter of law and as a matter of good sense. 
      
       
     88 The submission that the learned sentencing Judge erred in law by partially accumulating the sentences is, also, a submission that I do not accept. Her Honour’s approach to the partial accumulation of the sentences seems to me, with respect, to have held a fair and sensible balance between the need, on the one hand, to punish and deter two distinct attacks upon two separate victims; and, on the other hand, the need to respect the principle of totality by not simply accumulating both sentences. 
      
       
     89 There is no particular attack made upon the non-parole period fixed by her Honour. In my respectful opinion it does not depart from the fair exercise of the relevant sentencing discretion. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     90 For the whole of the foregoing reasons I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       [1] That the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
        
        
       [2] That leave be granted to appeal against sentence. 
        
        
       [3] That the appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
        
        
       
     91 HOWIE J; I agree with Sully J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HOWIE J: On 22 November 2000 the appellant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Moore and a jury on two counts of robbery in company. The offences were alleged to have been committed by the appellant on 13 August 2000 in two related incidents in Cabramatta. In respect of the first matter the alleged victim was Brian Austin and in the second Glen Hurry 
      
       
     2 The appellant pleaded Not Guilty to both counts. On 24 November 2000, at the conclusion of the Crown case and after the trial judge had given what is usually referred to as a Prasad direction, the jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty on the first count. The second count continued in the normal course to submissions and summing up, after which the jury retired to consider its verdict on 27 November. 
      
       
     3 At 10.10 am on 28 November 2000 the Judge received a note from the jury which read: 
      
       
        
         
         Yesterday while examining the red/blue Nike jacket of the accused in the lining beneath the black tape was two medi swipes and a glass tube wrapped in paper. I don’t know if this is important, but we felt that you should know (the tube was sharp at one end). Thank you. Jury (T38, 28/11/00) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     4 The trial judge, after hearing submissions from counsel, determined not to discharge the jury but to direct them to disregard the objects they had found. The jury subsequently convicted the appellant. The single ground of appeal relied upon is that the trial miscarried because these objects inadvertently found their way into the jury room. 
      
       
     5 The evidence in the Crown case can be described briefly. In the early evening of 13 August 2000 Glen Hurry and Brian Austin were walking together in Cabramatta when they were confronted by three persons, two males and a female. These persons began to walk alongside them and they were joined shortly thereafter by one or more other persons. 
      
       
     6 According to Mr Hurry’s account, one of them, an Aboriginal in his late thirties and wearing a cap, said to him, ""give us the gear"". Mr Hurry attempted to run away but was chased by a person he described as a young fellow with shoulder length brown hair. This person grabbed Mr Hurry and threw him against a brick wall saying that he was going to knock him over if he did not give him the gear. Another person, described by Mr Hurry as being ""pretty bulky"" and in his late twenties, then went through his pocket and found his mobile phone and wallet. This person was wearing a red and black, or possibly dark blue, Nike jacket and a pair of black track pants. The Crown asserted that this person was the appellant. 
      
       
     7 Mr Hurry suddenly found an opportunity to escape and ran into a shop nearby. He asked the shopkeeper to call the police. Mr Hurry remained in the shop and a short time later saw the man wearing the Nike jacket come into the shop and rummage through packets of chips. When police arrived, Mr Hurry identified the man in the Nike jacket as having robbed him. The appellant was then arrested. The shop owner told the police officer that she saw the man with the red and black jacket run into her shop, when the police arrived, and he went to the chip section. Her husband had looked in this area after the man had left the shop and found a mobile phone. The police officer went to the area indicated and there located a black mobile telephone fitting the description of that stolen from Mr Hurry. 
      
       
     8 Mr Austin gave evidence that the man in a black Nike hat and a red and black Nike jacket said to him, ""give us the gear"". He felt something sharp being pointed into him by this man. Mr Austin was then told to empty his pockets by a man in a blue basketball jersey. Another man then took him to a block of flats where he was asked to hand over his bag and directed to take his clothes off. He was then taken back to where he had been first accosted by these persons and the man in the red and black Nike jacket started searching through his pockets. At the same time a female was searching through his backpack. When a police patrol car came past, a police officer asked whether there was anything wrong. Mr Austin said that there was not and the police drove away. 
      
       
     9 Mr Austin observed the man in the red and black Nike jacket walk into a shop. A number of police soon arrived and this man was apprehended and searched. A person came out of the shop and pointed to this man and said that he had hidden a mobile phone behind some chips in the shop. 
      
       
     10 After his arrest the appellant took part in a recorded interview. At the time he was wearing a red and dark blue Nike jacket but did not have a cap. The appellant agreed that he had been in the shop and had picked up a packet of chips. However, he denied robbing anybody or placing a mobile telephone in the shop. 
      
       
     11 In its case the Crown tendered the dark blue and red Nike jacket that the appellant was wearing at the time of his arrest. 
      
       
     12 At the end of the Crown case his Honour gave a very short direction to the jury as to their right to acquit the appellant on both counts at that point in time. He told the jury that they had to determine each case independently but that the Crown case relied entirely upon the evidence of the two principal witnesses. After a short adjournment the jury returned. They indicated that they wished to find the appellant not guilty in respect of the count involving Mr Austin but the foreperson said: 
      
       
        
         
         In the case concerning Mr Hurry we feel that the Crown has adequately provided evidence that the trial should continue. 
         
        
       
     13 The appellant then gave evidence denying that he had robbed anyone or that he had hidden a mobile telephone in the shop. He agreed he entered the shop but it was because he wanted to buy an ice-block even though he only had fifty cents in his possession. He gave an account that before he entered the shop he chased away a person who wanted to know where he could buy some Rohypnol. 
      
       
     14 The defence case was that, although there had been a robbery, the appellant was not involved and was mistakenly arrested when he left the shop. 
      
       
     15 I have already indicated that after the jury had retired to consider its verdict a note was received about the objects that had been located in the appellant’s coat. Having received the note, the trial judge sought submissions from counsel as to what course he should take and whether this was a matter that could be cured by a direction as the allegation made by Mr Austin included that he had been touched in the ribs by the man in the Nike jacket by something sharp. The Crown Prosecutor urged his Honour to direct the jury to put it completely from their minds. The appellant’s counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         I’d support that, but what concerns me is that if they take that as maybe a weapon that could have been used and they speculate even after your Honour directs them then it will be very prejudicial to the accused. The other thing is your Honour, that since your Honour has already directed them to disregard the evidence of Mr Austin completely, and it’s Mr Austin who said something sharp was touched on his right side of his ribs, that’s what he said and of course, he didn’t say that to the police when he was cross examined, that it was the man in the Nike, black and red Nike jacket that poked him with anything. But there is room for quite a lot of speculation now Your Honour. But I think your Honour would be safe to tell them to basically disregard that completely, it is not part of the Crown case and I support your Honour’s decision that it was only merely tendered and relied upon the Crown as to the particular jacket. 
         
        
       
     16 After the jury returned to court a short time later, His Honour directed them as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The jacket was tendered for you to see its colour and size. It was relied on by the Crown in the way the Crown put it to you yesterday as evidence indicating that [the appellant] was guilty. It was also relied on by [defence counsel] as indicating that he was not a person who conducted the robbery, was not a person who was engaged in the robbery. That is the purpose for which it is tendered. The Crown was unaware of what has been [found by you] and so was [defence counsel]. The Crown does not rely on this aspect and it has never relied on it and you must put that right out of your mind. The jacket was only tendered as a jacket and not what you might find. It is important that you should not go searching through the exhibits to look for, like Sherlock Holmes, some other evidence that has not been brought out in the court room. You must decide this case just on the evidence in the court. That is exceptionally important. You should not speculate about things that are outside the evidence unless they are rational inferences drawn from the evidence itself. 
         
        
       
     17 The following exchange then took place: 
      
       
        
         
         Foreperson: Your Honour the only reason that we sent it through was basically because it was sharp and when I picked up the jacket I was holding it in my hand and you could feel the sharp bit through the thing, and when I tipped it upside down it actually came out, so we just wanted to let you know in case someone else picked it up and it was sharp and we didn’t want them to cut themselves. We did basically talk about [it] and disregard[ed] it completely as not relevant, but we thought that because people did handle [it] we should let you know.  
          
          
         His Honour: Right, thank you, oh good we were just concerned that you were letting us know in case you thought there was some other evidence flowing from it. 
          
          
         Foreperson: (not transcribable). 
          
          
         His Honour: Just completely disregard that for all purposes and thank you for telling us. 
         
        
        
       The jury then retired again and delivered their verdict about forty minutes later. 
        
       
     18 Counsel for the appellant has submitted that, notwithstanding the attitude taken by the appellant’s representative at the trial, the finding of the objects in the appellant’s jacket unfairly prejudiced his chance of an acquittal for three reasons, being: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) Mr Austin had said that the man in the Nike jacket had pointed something sharp at his ribs. The appellant, by the time the items were found, had been acquitted by the jury of that count, and it would be hard for a jury not to take some comfort from the find when they were considering their verdict in respect of Mr Hurry’s evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The items are suggestive of drug use. This is likely to create a prejudice in the minds of the jurors. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Both Mr Hurry and Mr Austin gave evidence that when the assailants approached them the assailants said “Give us your gear”, a well known colloquial expression for drugs. 
         
        
       
     19 The question for this Court to determine is whether it is satisfied that the irregularity that occurred would not have affected the jury’s verdict. In determining that question it is necessary not only to consider the possible influence the irregularity might have had upon the jury by reason of its nature and significance to the issues before them, but also the effectiveness of steps taken to reduce the impact of the irregularity upon the jury. In determining this issue regard should be paid to the attitude of trial counsel who would be expected to be aware of the full ramifications of what occurred and how it might impact upon the issues before the jury. 
      
       
     20 In R v Landsell (NSWCCA, unreported, 22 May 1995) fragments of glass were found by the jury in a bag tendered in the Crown case. There was no evidence as to the origins of the glass and it was not suggested by either party that it had any relevance to the proof of the charges. There was, however, some evidence as to the breaking of a car window in the incident that gave rise to one of the charges before the jury. The trial judge directed the jury that the fragments of glass were not part of the evidence, that there was no evidence of how they came to be in the bag and they should not speculate upon that matter. 
      
       
     21 Simpson J, who was in the minority on the question of whether a miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of the irregularity of non-evidentiary material being placed before the jury, stated (at 11-12): 
      
       
        
         
         The presence of the glass in the bag, once before the jury, constituted an irregularity in the trial:  
         R v Marsland 
          unreported, CCA, 17 July 1991;  
         R v Rudkowski 
         , unreported, CCA, 15 December 1992;  
         R v Domican No.3 
          (1990) 46 A Crim R 428. The question to be determined then is whether the irregularity was such that this Court could be satisfied that it did not affect the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred:  
         Marsland  
         (supra),  
         Rudkowski 
         , (supra). This is the same test which is applied where evidence has been held to have been wrongly admitted:  
         R v Maric  
         (1978) 52 ALJR 631. It is the test which was applied by this Court, with different results, in both  
         Marsland  
         and  
         Rudkowski 
         . Those cases are distinguishable one from the other, inter alia, by the timing of the discovery of the irregularity. In  
         Marsland 
          the irregularity was discovered by its being brought to the attention of the trial judge by the jury during the course of their deliberation. In  
         Rudkowski  
         the irregularity was not discovered until after verdict. But the circumstance of the timing of the discovery of the irregularity does not, in my view, make any difference to the test to be applied.  
          
          
         Where the irregularity is disclosed during the trial, the same question must be asked, but the answer will depend, not only upon the magnitude and nature of the irregularity, but also upon the efficacy of the measures taken towards its amelioration following its discovery. In  
         Marsland  
         the irregularity having come to light before verdict, it was possible to take remedial steps, steps which were held by this Court to be sufficient. Similarly, in the present case, the answer to the question the court must ask itself will depend, not only upon the nature and degree of the irregularity, but upon an examination of the remedial steps taken.  
          
          
         The system necessarily places a great deal of faith in the ability of a jury to accept, and follow, the directions of a trial judge, even in circumstances where it might appear to the jury that they are asked to act against the dictates of common sense. Equally, however, the system recognises that there are bounds beyond which a jury cannot be expected, or asked, to go. For this reason, the criminal appeal courts have developed the notion encapsulated in the commonly used phrase ""no direction to the jury could have cured the damage ....."" Implicit in this notion is the recognition that there are occasions when the legal system accepts that a jury will not, or cannot be expected to, comply with the directions of a trial judge 
         
        
        
       Her Honour was of the view that the directions given by the trial judge were not capable of curing the prejudice flowing from the irregularity in that case. 
        
       
     22 Gleeson CJ, with whom Finlay J agree, stated (at 4): 
      
       
        
         
         As Simpson J has observed in her judgment, an irregularity having occurred, the question for this court is whether we are satisfied that it did not affect the verdicts, and that the jury would have returned the same verdicts if the irregularity had not occurred. That question is to be answered in the light of the direction which the trial judge gave when the irregularity came to his attention. 
          
          
         Criminal trials, and appeals, are conducted upon certain assumptions, one of which is that juries understand and follow the instructions and directions they are given by trial judges. It frequently happens, in the course of trials, that information comes to the notice of juries which, for one reason or another, they are bound to disregard. For example, in joint trials evidence is often led which is admissible against one accused but not another. Sometimes such evidence has the potential to cause considerable prejudice to the accused against whom it is not admissible. Ordinarily, however, it is accepted that the problem can be solved by an appropriate direction to the jury to the effect that they should consider the case against each accused separately and, where necessary, disregard, for one particular purpose, information which they may use for another purpose.  
          
          
         Sometimes it happens that inadmissible material is of such a nature that a trial judge, or an appellate court, will conclude that no direction can adequately protect an accused person and that the only proper remedy is to discharge the jury, or, following a conviction, to order a new trial. 
          
          
         In my judgment, the material in question in the present case does not fall into that category. There is no reason to doubt that the jury would have understood and complied with the direction they were given. I am reinforced in that conclusion by the assessment of the situation that was made by the trial judge and by trial counsel, although I acknowledge that it is the duty of this court to make its own independent assessment.  
         
        
       
     23 Similar considerations arise where at the trial a request was made for a discharge of the jury because of some irregularity of this nature but the discharge was refused by the trial judge. This Court is then required to determine for itself whether there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the irregularity but should take into account the attitude of the trial judge and what steps were taken before the jury to address the impact of the irregularity. In R v Gilbert Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267 this Court quoted the following passage from Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440-441: 
      
       
        
         
         ""No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript"".  
          
          
         Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice"".  
         
        
       
      
      
       
       And referred to a later passage in the same judgment: 
        
         
         ""…it is necessary to operate upon the assumption that a jury will be capable of conforming to judicial instruction to put particular evidence out of account"".  
         
        
       
     24 In the present case, it is not necessary for this Court to resort to an assumption that the jury would abide by the direction of the trial judge as it normally must do. It should be recalled that, when explaining why the matter had been brought to the Court’s attention, the foreperson said:  
      
       
        
         
         ….We did basically talk about [it] and disregard[ed] it completely as not relevant, but we thought that because people did handle [it] we should let you know. 
         
        
        
       I do not see why the foreperson’s statement should not be relied upon when considering whether there was a possibility that the finding of the objects may have influenced their verdict. 
        
       
     25 The first matter relied upon as showing that irreparable prejudice had been suffered by the appellant, is that Mr Austin gave evidence that the person in the Nike jacket had pointed something sharp at his ribs. It was submitted that the jury might have used the objects found to infer that this person was the appellant and then used that finding to support the charge involving Mr Hurry. 
      
       
     26 It is clear that Mr Austin was an unsatisfactory witness in many ways and the fact that the jury acquitted on that count at the end of the Crown case is unsurprising. It appears that persons in court had considerable difficulty hearing his evidence. On a number of occasions the trial judge complained of being unable to hear what he was saying. His Honour also commented to counsel that the jury had given indications during his evidence that they could not hear or understand what he was saying. Further, the witness was proved to be unreliable in that crucial parts of his evidence were inconsistent with his statement to police. His description of the person in the Nike jacket did not match the appellant in a number of significant respects. There were inconsistencies between the description he gave to the jury of this person and that which he had given to the police. 
      
       
     27 On the other hand, the evidence against the appellant in respect of the charge involving Mr Hurry was overwhelming because of the finding of the victim’s mobile telephone in the very place where the appellant had been standing in the shop. The appellant’s explanation of why he went into the shop was unconvincing to say the least. Although the jury were warned of the dangers of identification evidence, it was not the usual case of visual identification. The evidence of Mr Hurry was that the person who had just robbed him came into the shop shortly after he did. There was no dispute that the appellant entered the shop a short time after Mr Hurry and that he left just as the police arrived. It was a very strong circumstantial case and, once again, it is not surprising that the jury dismissed the possibility that the appellant had not been the person who placed the mobile phone where it was found and hence was the robber. 
      
       
     28 The jury were given directions about the evidence of Mr Austin in the summing up as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Now in looking at the evidence in this matter, the way this case has gone, the verdict that you return in the case concerning Mr Austin means that you should completely disregard Mr Austin's evidence for all purposes. As I said to you at the outset these are two cases that were heard together for the sake of convenience and Mr Austin's evidence against - in Mr Austin's evidence rather, is evidence in the Crown case in that matter and should not be taken into account in this matter and it is important that you should disregard the evidence for all purposes. The - well perhaps I should just leave it at that - I was about to say Mr Austin's evidence was given in a very low volume so one cannot be sure from here or from the bar table just what it was that you heard Mr Austin say. It is what you heard that matters. So I do not propose to deal with any parts of his evidence which, as I say, were given in that case and it would only be for the purpose of indicating to you, in any event, that you should not take it into account in this matter. So it is very important that you should not take his evidence into account in this case in any way. 
         
        
       
     29 I do not believe that there is any real possibility that the jury would have used any evidence given by Mr Austin when considering the case involving Mr Hurry both because of the nature and manner of his evidence and the directions given in respect of it. I do not think that there is any real possibility that the situation changed when the jury found the objects in the appellant's jacket. 
      
       
     30 I am also of the view that the other two matters relied upon are without substance. The items are not necessarily suggestive of drug use, but, even if they were, I do not believe that the jury would have used that evidence to the prejudice of the appellant such that he lost any reasonable prospect of acquittal. The suggestion that in some way the finding of those objects would have led the jury to reason that, because they were indicative of drug use and because there was evidence given by Mr Hurry that the assailants had said ""give us your gear"", it followed that the appellant was one of the assailants is untenable. In any event, the persons most capable of determining whether there was any prejudice arising in any way from this irregularity were the trial judge and the appellant’s counsel. Neither raised any suggestion of prejudice being occasioned from the finding of the objects on the basis that the appellant might be thought to be a drug user. 
      
       
     31 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft the judgment of Howie J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
      
       
     2 SULLYJ: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     3 HOWIE J: On 17 May 2002 the respondent was convicted by Solomon DCJ of sixteen counts of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29D of the Crimes Act (Cth). The maximum penalty prescribed in respect of each of those offences is 10 years imprisonment or a fine of $110,000 or both. In respect of each offence she was sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years. His Honour then made an order that the respondent be released upon her entering into a recognisance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act conditioned (1) that she be of good behaviour for 2½ years and (2) during that period that she place herself under the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. His Honour also ordered that the respondent make reparation to the Commonwealth. 
      
       
     4 The Crown appeals against that sentence asserting that it is manifestly inadequate. In support of that overall submission the Crown relies upon what are said to be three particular errors made by the sentencing judge as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         1. his Honour erred in reaching his conclusion about “exceptional circumstances” when the respondent had not been cross-examined. 
          
          
         2. his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence; 
          
          
         3. his Honour erred in imposing a sentence which did not require the respondent to serve the period in custody. 
         
        
       
     5 The facts of the offences for which the respondent was sentenced are not in dispute and can be stated very briefly. The respondent was employed with Centrelink from 1992 as a customer service operator in the Youth Employment Services team. Between June 1999 and March 2000 she received either a Newstart Allowance or a Youth Allowance for each of sixteen identities that she had created for the purpose of defrauding the Commonwealth. In total over the nine-month period of the offences she was paid $78,593.77 to which she was not entitled. The proceeds were placed into three bank accounts in the name of either herself, her then de facto partner or her daughter. This criminal conduct came to an end only when her employer discovered the fraudulent entries. The respondent claimed that she spent the money gambling in order to escape an abusive relationship in which she found herself at the time. 
      
       
     6 The respondent pleaded guilty to each of the charges before a magistrate shortly after the brief of evidence was served upon her. She was committed to the District Court for sentence under the provisions of s 51A of the Justices Act and adhered to her pleas before Judge Solomon on 27 March 2002. On that date the material relied upon by the Crown was tendered. This included written submissions as to the principles to be applied in sentencing the respondent. The defence then tendered a psychological report, a number of testimonials and referred his Honour to some decisions of this Court. 
      
       
     7 The psychological report contained the following material. The respondent, who was aged 26 years, was of the Aboriginal race. She was brought up in a loving, stable environment in the western suburbs of Sydney. Her parents are both employed, her father is a Senior Youth Worker with a bail house and her mother is employed at the same Centrelink office where the respondent had been employed. They have offered her strong support. 
      
       
     8 The respondent entered into a relationship with a childhood friend when she was aged 20 years after renewing her acquaintance with him while visiting her brother in gaol. After he was released to parole, the respondent fell pregnant to him but before the birth of the child he was returned to custody. When he was next released the child, Shanarah, was aged thirteen months and the respondent and her partner began to live together. The respondent claims that he began to drink alcohol to excess and she suffered both physical and emotional abuse at his hands. She became depressed and commenced gambling in order to find release. In order to support her gambling she committed the frauds upon her employer. After she was charged with the offences, the relationship came to an end. 
      
       
     9 The respondent resided with her daughter, who was aged four years at the time of the report, in accommodation provided by the Department of Housing. The respondent has obtained some casual employment. She has little contact with the child’s father. The respondent has ceased gambling since being charged and initially sought help from Gamblers Anonymous. She understands the connection between her relationship with her de facto, her gambling and the offending behaviour. 
      
       
     10 In reference to the respondents daughter, the psychologist reported: 
      
       
        
         
          
         Shanara[h] is now four years of age. [The respondent] feels that Shanara[h] has been affected by her own and [her de facto’s] relationship as she was a witness to the verbal and physical abuse. She reports that Shanara[h] has behavioural problems for which [the respondent] has sought assistance at her local hospital. [The respondent] feels that Shanara[h]’s behavioural problems have worsened since her split from [her de facto]. Shanara[h]’s difficulties have been noted at pre-school, and result in situations such as during our meeting, where [the respondent] was called to take Shanara[h] home. She appears to be willing to do all she can to assist Shanara[h], and also has support from her extended family in this regard. 
         
        
       
     11 Having read the material tendered to him, his Honour indicated that he wished to know more about the situation with the respondent’s daughter and specifically identified the evidence he wished to have before him on the adjourned hearing date. The matter was then adjourned to 17 May 2002. 
      
       
     12 On the adjourned date the defence tendered without objection a number of documents chiefly concerning the position of the respondent’s child. In an affidavit, the respondent set out her relationship with her de facto much as she had told the psychologist. In respect of her daughter she stated that Shanarah had been attending a child-care centre daily since she was aged 4 months but in the last year had started to manifest behavioural problems that led to complaints from the centre. Her daughter was placed under the care of a child psychologist. The child suffers from rapid mood changes and is difficult to care for. She stated that there was no one to look after the child except her parents and they can only cope for a couple of hours at a time. 
      
       
     13 Statements from the respondent’s parents confirmed both the nature of the respondent’s relationship with her de facto and the behavioural difficulties with Shanarah that meant they were not able to care for her on a full-time basis. There were letters from the employers of the respondent’s parents tendered indicating that her mother was sometimes required to travel to different parts of the country and that her father was on 24 hour call, seven days a week. 
      
       
     14 There was also material from the day-care centre, which Shanarah attended, confirming that there had been difficulties with the child and that she had for a period been suspended from the centre. There was also in evidence a report from a teacher at the centre indicating the nature of the behavioural problems that she had experienced with Shanarah. These included the child engaging in physical and verbal abuse against other children at the centre, attention seeking by outbursts of screaming, and intimidation of other children. The report also records the involvement of the respondent in attempting to address the behavioural problems of her daughter. 
      
       
     15 A child psychologist, Dr Kozlowska, at the Children's Hospital at Westmead prepared a report for the sentencing court in which she described Shanarah as presenting with severe behavioural problems and emotional issues. A neurological assessment of the child found that there was no underlying organic pathology. Dr Kozlowska described Shanarah’s problem behaviour as including slapping, punching, kicking other children and preschool staff, spitting at other children and pulling their hair. She said that the child was unable to be settled when in a rage and required therapeutic restraint. Shanarah also demonstrated ""repressed age-inappropriate behaviours such as clinging, refusal to separate from her mother, whining, whimpering, bossiness and difficulties with adults setting limits”. 
      
       
     16 Dr Kozlowska recommended a treatment program for Shanarah including visits to the preschool centre by an occupational therapist, inpatient treatment to assist the respondent with parenting skills to manage her daughter's difficulties, and ongoing family outpatient management including the respondent, her daughter and possibly the grandparents. The treatment program was described as being intense and would require the respondent's participation. As to the possibility of a separation of the respondent from her daughter, Dr Kozlowska stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “ 
         A separation from [the respondent], Shanarah's primary attachment figure in the context of imprisonment is not in Shanarah's best interest, is likely to be experienced as traumatic, and will result in an escalation of distress and emotional and behavioural symptoms. Moreover, should Shanarah require foster placement, availability of placement will be limited in view of Shanarah's disturbed behaviour together with the significant distress she will experience if separated from her mother. Foster families are likely to find Shanarah's behaviour difficult to manage, be unable to settle her and breakdown resulting in multiple placements can be expected. Multiple placements, that it is, an inability to provide consistent caregivers will further aggravate Shanarah's difficulties. 
         
        
       
       
       Dr Kozlowska concluded: 
        
         
          
         “From Shanarah's perspective, a good psychological outcome characterised by age (in)appropriate function can be expected if [the respondent] and Shanarah engage in appropriate therapeutic intervention as outlined in this report."" 
         
        
       
     17 The Crown on this appeal does not contend that there was any specific error revealed in the remarks of the sentencing judge. It seems to me, with respect, that his Honour had a due appreciation of the seriousness of the offences committed by the respondent and he specifically stated that he was taking into consideration the need for general and individual deterrence in relation to such offences. He also indicated that he took into account that the respondent's conduct involved a “serious and substantial breach of trust”. 
      
       
     18 His Honour concluded that he had no doubt that the destructive relationship between the respondent and her partner caused her to gain solace from gambling and that, had it not been for the nature of that relationship, the respondent would not have gambled as she did. Judge Solomon also concluded that the destructive relationship had affected the respondent's daughter. He quoted at length from the material to which I have referred which touched upon Shanarah's behaviour and how it might be treated. His Honour stated that he was satisfied that the child suffered from significant deep-seated psychological trauma and that she required ongoing treatment in the future. Further, Judge Solomon concluded that the respondent was the only person who was properly able to care for her daughter having regard to Shanarah’s psychological condition. 
      
       
     19 Having referred to the material relating to the respondent and her daughter, his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “ I have dealt with many cases over the years and I cannot think of a case which falls more within the arena of exceptional circumstances than this case. If this prisoner were to be imprisoned, I am satisfied that irreparable psychological harm would be occasioned to her daughter. Over two days I have had the benefit of observing Shanarah's behaviour in this court room and that behaviour reflects the observations by Dr Kozlowska, the child psychiatrist, Josephine Vannitamby, the school teacher and the grandparents of Shanarah.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour’s reference to “exceptional circumstances” is obviously a reference to the principle that, before the hardship occasioned by the offender’s imprisonment on a third person can be taken into account, it must be exceptional;  
       Edwards 
        (1996) 90 A Crim R 510;  
       Muanchukingham 
        (1990) 52 A Crim R 354. 
        
       
     20 His Honour concluded that in light of the seriousness of the offences, the respondent should receive a prison sentence but that such a sentence should be suspended. His Honour then made the orders that I have indicated at the commencement of this judgment, imposing a sentence of imprisonment for two and a half years upon the respondent but then ordering her immediate release upon entering into a recognisance. 
      
       
     21 The first ground of appeal relied upon by the Crown asserts that his Honour erred in finding ""exceptional circumstances"" when the respondent had not been cross-examined. In the Crown's written submissions placed before this Court the heading under which this ground is argued is, “Failure to Allow Cross-Examination of the Respondent"". The first paragraph under that heading is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “It is submitted that his Honour’s question and subsequent ruling that he would not impose a custodial sentence effectively prevented the Crown from cross-examining the respondent. In that circumstance the trial was unfair.” 
         
        
       
     22 This submission relates to that part of the proceedings on 17 May 2002 that followed the luncheon adjournment. Just prior to that adjournment and before tendering a large amount of defence material, including an affidavit by the respondent, the solicitor then appearing for her informed the sentencing judge that the Crown wished to cross-examine the respondent and that he would call her later. His Honour said that he would take a little while to read the material and confirmed with the Crown that she wished to cross-examine the respondent, the Crown answering, “Just briefly, your Honour”. The adjournment was then taken. 
      
       
     23 On the resumption of the hearing, his Honour indicated that he had read the material tendered and the two decisions that had been handed up by the Crown. The following exchange then took place: 
      
       
        
         
          
         His Honour 
         : ……I have reread the Crown submissions on sentence and I have read the statement of facts. Have you finished with your submissions, Madam Crown? 
          
          
         Crown:  
         Yes, your Honour I have. 
          
          
         His Honour 
         : I will indicate now, having read the material before me, that it is not my intention to impose a custodial sentence on the prisoner so perhaps you can tell your client. 
         
        
       
       
       Thereafter, a further report was tendered and his Honour stated: 
        
         
          
         I haven't said that my sentencing options, having regard [to] the exceptional circumstances and exceptional problems your client has with her daughter, I think, are limited to a bond, a bond with supervision. 
          
          
         I have considered community service, but I think she is doing a community service looking after her child, and so they are my intentions, unless you want to address me further. 
         
        
        
       The solicitor for the respondent indicated he would not make any more submissions. His Honour then sought assistance from the Crown in relation to the orders he might make and the operation of the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth  
       Crimes Act 
       . 
        
       
     24 True it is that his Honour sentenced the respondent without giving the Crown the opportunity to cross-examine her, but that omission was clearly an oversight. However, when his Honour asked the Crown whether she had finished with her submissions, I would have thought that the parties could have anticipated that his Honour was then going to proceed to sentence. That is why his Honour asked whether the Crown had finished making submissions. There was no reason why the Crown’s representative could not then have reminded his Honour that she still wished to cross-examine the respondent. If she had said so, I do not doubt that his Honour would have allowed her that opportunity. But, even accepting that some procedural irregularity occurred by his Honour’s oversight and the Crown’s diffidence, if not neglect, which effectively lost the Crown the opportunity to cross-examine the respondent, I find it difficult to believe that the sentencing proceedings so miscarried that this Court should interfere on that basis alone. 
      
       
     25 In any event, if this Court were to find that the proceedings had miscarried in this way, the appropriate response would be to remit the matter to the District Court for further hearing under s 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act. I do not believe that such a course is warranted. The fact that her daughter was suffering from behavioural and emotional problems and that they would be exacerbated by separation from her mother was not really put in dispute. If it were to be, then the Crown would have needed to do a great deal more than briefly cross-examine the respondent. 
      
       
     26 The second and third grounds relied upon by the Crown can be considered together: if his Honour erred in imposing a sentence which did not require the respondent to serve a period in custody it was because his Honour gave insufficient weight to the seriousness of the offence. This is because a finding that the effect on a third party of the imprisonment of an offender is so exceptional that it can be taken into account to reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence must depend upon an evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence for which sentence is being passed. The more serious the offence, the less likely it is that the effect of imprisonment on a third person will be sufficiently exceptional so that regard might be taken of it. 
      
       
     27 There is no doubt in my mind that the offences committed by the respondent would normally require that a significant period of imprisonment be imposed by way of full-time custody notwithstanding the subjective features of the respondent herself. There was a relatively lengthy and sustained episode of serious criminal conduct requiring the imposition of condign punishment. This is particularly so because the respondent was an employee of the Commonwealth and, therefore, there was a significant breach of trust involved. In Delcaro (1989) 41 A Crim R 33 at 36 the following was stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         In Luu (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 7 December 1984) the then Chief Justice, Sir Laurence Street, said:  
          
           
           ""The Courts of this State have uniformly sought to make plain to persons who abuse the system of social welfare that they must expect to face heavy penalties. The introduction into the administration of that system of overly meticulous preliminary checks before benefits are paid could result in real hardships to persons whose need for benefit is urgent and immediate. Thus it is that such susceptibility is open to abuse, which results in persons who do abuse it receiving salutary penal consequences at the hands of the Courts.""  
           
          
         That decision has been approved on quite a number of occasions, and I mention specifically Perks (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 8 May 1987) and Tipene (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 7 May 1987).  
          
         . 
         
        
       It was held in that case that neither periodic detention nor community service would have been adequate to meet the seriousness of the offences for which the respondent had been charged. 
        
       
     28 The fact that the present offences might have been explained by the effect of an abusive relationship on the respondent would not have provided sufficient mitigation to permit a more lenient course being adopted than that required to denounce her conduct and act as a significant general deterrent. It is rarely the case that such offences will be explained by greed alone. Gambling that results in serious criminality can usually be found to have its genesis in some psychological disorder that is not of the offender’s making. But when the resultant criminality is of a high order, as it was here, then little allowance can be made for such an explanation other than as it may impact upon the prospects of rehabilitation when the non-parole period or minimum period of imprisonment is being considered. 
      
       
     29 The significant attack by the Crown on the present sentence is that the total sentence was suspended. In aid of the submission that such a course resulted in manifest inadequacy, the Crown points to the fact that the respondent was suitable for periodic detention but his Honour did not consider that as an option. The Crown contends that to suspend the total sentence imposed paid insufficient regard to general deterrence even though his Honour expressly referred to that matter. The Crown is also critical, with some justification in my respectful opinion, of his Honour’s statement that the respondent was already performing community service by looking after her daughter. 
      
       
     30 However, the question on this appeal is whether it was outside the proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion to determine that the effect of imprisonment upon the respondent’s daughter was such that in all the circumstances of the case it justified the highly unusual course of imposing a sentence which did not require the respondent to serve immediately a sentence of actual imprisonment of some form. 
      
       
     31 It is now clear that the reference in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to the “probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependents” should be read as if it were proceeded by the words “in an exceptional case”: R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 where many of the relevant cases concerned with the effect on a child of a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the mother are considered in the judgment of Grove J. But each case will, to a very great degree, depend upon its own facts involving an evaluation of the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence committed, the extent of the requirement for general and, perhaps, specific deterrence, and the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person. It should be exmphasised that the question of whether the probable effect of a sentence upon a third party will give rise to an exceptional case, cannot be considered in isolation from the facts of the particular matter and the degree of criminality involved in the offences for which sentence is to be imposed. 
      
       
     32 Whether exceptional circumstances exist is a finding of fact and this Court is strictly curtailed in displacing a finding of fact by a sentencing judge with a finding of its own, especially where error which might infect that finding cannot be shown. Where there is no patent error, the Court can only intervene where it is satisfied that there is no basis upon which the finding could be made. I am not satisfied that it was not open to his Honour to reach the finding that he did. This was a case where there was reliable and undisputed evidence that there was, at the time of sentence, severe behavioural and emotional problems being experienced by the respondent’s child and that the child’s long-term psychological well being would be affected by the full-time imprisonment of the respondent, not just because the respondent would be separated from her (which itself would probably not have been sufficiently exceptional) but because the respondent was needed both to care for the child and to take an active part in the child’s treatment. 
      
       
     33 However, the question that then arises is what should have been his Honour’s response to that finding in light of the seriousness of the offences committed by the respondent and the importance of general deterrence in offences of this nature. In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, this Court was concerned with the appropriateness of a suspended sentence to act as effective punishment and reflect general deterrence. In my judgment, with which Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed, I stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         32. Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 
         
        
       
     34 In the present case the particular question is whether the suspended sentence was an adequate form of punishment and sufficiently reflected general deterrence notwithstanding the exceptional circumstances found by his Honour in respect of the situation of the respondent’s child. The respondent was assessed as being suitable for periodic detention. His Honour gave no reasons for rejecting that sentencing option notwithstanding that it would have apparently permitted the respondent to participate in the proposed therapy for her child. No doubt his Honour was concerned that it would mean, at least for some period of the sentence, that the respondent would be separated from the child for two evenings each week. It may have imposed difficulties on the parents of the respondent but this question was not really investigated by his Honour. 
      
       
     35 I am persuaded that in this particular case a suspended sentence was inappropriate punishment to denounce the criminality of the respondent particularly in light of the period over which the offences were committed and the breach of trust involved. Although his Honour was justified by reason of the exceptional circumstances he found to avoid imposing a full-time custodial sentence as would normally be required, there had to be some form of actual imprisonment that the respondent was required to serve. The leniency involved in a suspended sentence could not in this case adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offences committed or the need for general deterrence. 
      
       
     36 The Court has received an affidavit from the respondent in the event that it was necessary to re-sentence her. It reveals that Shanarah has been undergoing treatment and in response her behaviour has improved. She has returned to the day-care centre. She has also stayed with her grandparents on three occasions when she has stayed with them overnight. Repayments of about $50 per week are deducted from welfare payments the respondent has been receiving since she lost her job with Centrelink. 
      
       
     37 During the hearing of the appeal the Court requested that an updated report be made available indicating whether the respondent was suitable to serve a sentence by way of periodic detention. The Court reserved its decision so that a report could be prepared and made available to the Court with the consent of the parties. A report dated 26 September 2002 was subsequently sent to the Court indicating that the respondent is suitable to serve the sentence by way of periodic detention and that suitable arrangements have been put in place for the care of the child while the respondent is in custody. 
      
       
     38 It should be noted that, although it was open to his Honour to find the present to be a truly exceptional case, a finding to the contrary would not necessarily have been erroneous. Further, periodic detention should not normally be considered to be an appropriate sentence to meet the seriousness of offences such as those committed by the respondent. Nor should this decision be taken as indicating that the care of a child by a mother will generally be regarded as an exceptional circumstance permitting an otherwise appropriate sentence to be avoided. 
      
       
     39 I propose that the appeal be allowed and that the sentence imposed by Judge Solomon be quashed. In lieu the respondent be sentenced to 2 years 2 months imprisonment to date from 11 October 2002 and is to be released after serving 14 months of that sentence, that is on 10 December 2003 upon the respondent entering into a recognizance and upon her giving security in the sum of $1000 without surety. The recognizance is to be conditioned that the respondent be of good behaviour for the period of the recognizance and that she place herself under the supervision of the NSW Probation and Parole Service. The sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. The respondent is to report to the Norma Parker Periodic Detention Centre on the date that the sentence commences.

      Shalhoub v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
    1 His Honour: On 26 December 2000, the plaintiff, a registered nurse, Mrs Shalhoub, was on duty at the Sir Thomas Mitchell Nursing Home. She had a large number of residents under her care. 
     
      
    2 I will refer to residents by an initial in each case. 
     
      
    3 At about 7.30 am, the plaintiff and a fellow worker, Ms Tanaka, also a registered nurse, put onto a trolley the medication which residents were to receive that morning. A Mr R was to receive 300 mg of MS Contin in the form of a 200 mg and a 100 mg tablet. A Ms G and others were to receive other medication. 
     
      
    4 The plaintiff went off with the trolley to administer the medications. When she came to Mr R, she found that the MS Contin, which had been put on the trolley for him, was not there. A search was unproductive. The initial dose of MS Contin was written up as discarded. A fresh dose was withdrawn for Mr R and administered to him. 
     
      
    5 Ms G was observed in the course of normal activities at about 3 pm, first by the plaintiff and then by another registered nurse, Ms Steel. Nothing untoward was noticed. The plaintiff left for the day at about 3 pm. 
     
      
    6 At about 4.45 pm, adverse signs were observed in Ms G by the nursing staff. An ambulance were called. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for respiratory depression. 
     
      
    7 The plaintiff was charged by information with two offences. The first was an offence against reg 154 of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 1994, in alleging that the plaintiff had made a false record. That charge related to the record of the initial dose of MS Contin being “discarded”. 
     
      
    8 The second was an offence under s 54 of the Crimes Act 1900 which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        54 Causing grievous bodily harm 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Whosoever by any unlawful or negligent act, or omission, causes grievous bodily harm to any person, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years. 
          
         
        
       
       
      The charge in relation to the second offence was as follows: 
       
       
        
        That Lorna Rose Shaloub  
        [sic] 
         between the 26th day of December 2000 and the 27th day of December 2000, at ILLAWONG, in the State of New South Wales, did by a negligent omission, to wit, being a registered nurse failed in her duty of care in that she incorrectly administered 300mgs of MS CONTIN (S8 Drug) to patient  
        [Ms G] 
         and did then neglect to obtain appropriate counter active treatment for the said  
        [Ms G] 
         thereby causing grievous bodily harm to the said  
        [Ms G] 
        . 
        
       
      
    9 The plaintiff was tried summarily in the Sutherland Local Court on 26, 27 and 28 November 2001, before Mr Maughan, magistrate. She was convicted of both offences. 
     
      
    10 The plaintiff appealed to the District Court against the conviction for the first offence. The conviction was quashed. She has appealed to this Court against the conviction for the second offence, pursuant to s 104 of the Justices Act 1902 which provides, so far as is material, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        104 When an appeal can be made by a defendant or other person

            A person against whom any conviction or order was made, or sentence was imposed, by a Magistrate in summary proceedings may appeal under this Division to the Supreme Court on any of the following grounds: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) a ground that involves a question of law alone, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) the ground that the conviction, order or sentence cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    11 Section 109 of the Justices Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        109 Powers of Supreme Court in determining appeals 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Supreme Court may, after hearing an appeal, determine the appeal by dismissing the appeal or by doing any one or more of the following: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) confirming, quashing, setting aside or varying the conviction, order or sentence appealed against or any part of it,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) increasing or reducing the sentence appealed against, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) making such other orders as it thinks just, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) remitting the matter to the Magistrate who made the conviction or order, or imposed the sentence, to hear and determine the matter of the appeal.  
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The charge which is the subject of the present appeal explicitly alleged an omission as distinct from an act. The omission was that, having incorrectly administered the drug MS Contin to Ms G, the plaintiff negligently failed to obtain appropriate counteractive treatment for Ms G, causing her grievous bodily harm. The charge did not allege, in terms, that the incorrect administration of the drug to Ms G was “negligent”. The incorrect administration of the drug to Ms G was a prefatory averment. It was not the act or omission allegedly constituting the first element of the offence. The negligent act or omission alleged was the omission to obtain appropriate counteractive treatment for Ms G. 
     
      
    13 The evidence was that the ingestion of even 100 mg of MS Contin by a naïve patient, such as Ms G, was likely to result in complications including respiratory depression, and that the correct treatment for such a person was to administer Naloxone prophylactically, observe and then administer more of that drug as necessary. 
     
      
    14 The crux of the charge was the allegedly negligent omission to obtain the appropriate treatment for Ms G. That can only have been a negligent omission if the plaintiff knew or reasonably suspected that the missing MS Contin had been mistakenly given to Ms G rather than to any other resident or had gone missing in some other way. There was no suggestion in the evidence that, if all that was known or suspected was that one of a large number of naïve individuals had been given at least 100 mg of MS Contin, it would be appropriate to give to them all the antidote. 
     
      
    15 In the context of the evidence, the charge of a negligent omission to obtain appropriate counteractive treatment for Ms G made sense only if the plaintiff knew or had reason to suspect that Ms G in particular had ingested MS Contin. 
     
      
    16 The information did not allege that mental element. It alleged, in that regard, only that the plaintiff had incorrectly administered the drug to Ms G. However, it was implicit in the allegation of a negligent omission to obtain appropriate counteractive treatment for Ms G that, at the time of the omission, the plaintiff knew or suspected that the drug had been mistakenly given to a resident other than Mr R and that the resident who had been given it was Ms G. 
     
      
    17 So the gist of the charge was that, having incorrectly administered MS Contin to Ms G and either knowing or suspecting that that was so, the plaintiff failed to obtain the appropriate counteractive treatment for her, with the result that Ms G suffered grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    18 In broad terms, there were two grounds of appeal: first, that the learned magistrate erred in failing to hold that the charge was duplicitous; and, secondly, that the learned magistrate erred in law in finding that the offence was made out. 
     
      
    19 I need not deal with the first such ground of appeal in view of my determination in relation to the second ground. However, I would observe, in passing, that I do not think the charge was not duplicitous, construed as I construe it. 
     
      
    20 As to the second ground, it is necessary to examine the findings made by the learned magistrate which in his view made out the offence. 
     
      
    21 The following is the relevant section of his Worship’s judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        The charge under s54 of the Crimes Act is that the defendant did by a negligent omission, to wit being a registered nurse, fail in her duty of care in that she incorrectly administered 300 milligrams of MS Contin, a Schedule 8 drug, to a patient,  
        [Ms G] 
        , and did then neglect to obtain appropriate counteractive treatment for the said  
        [Ms G] 
         occasioning to her grievous bodily harm. There has been, as I said, some cases presented in respect to grievous bodily harm and there has been no issue in respect of that. 
        
       
       
        
        What the defendant is charged with the tribunal of facts has to decide, in my view, is being criminally negligent and, again, I am mindful of the submissions of law made by Mr Byrne in respect of that term and I accept them in her omission to carry out her duties as a registered nurse. I think it true to say that the case against the defendant in respect to administering that drug to  
        [Ms G] 
         is a circumstantial one. I suppose it is appropriate for the Court to say that when considering whether a fact is established in these sorts of cases, that is, circumstantial cases, the tribunal of fact has to be satisfied that there is no other reasonable hypothesis than the fact alleged on the evidence before it.  
        
       
       
        
        It then has to turn to the evidence in this case. There can be no doubt, in my view, that the defendant got the drugs out of the locked cabinet. There is no doubt that the drugs she got out she did not give to  
        [Mr R] 
        . It seems clear on the evidence to me that both the defendant and Nurse Taninaka made a search, I suppose is the only word you can describe, for the drugs and they were not found. It is clear that an audit of the drugs and register show that there are no other drugs that are unaccounted for, if one can use that term. It is clear that the Court has found that the defendant made a false entry in the drug register. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court has to take into account the statement of Nurse Taninaka that has been tendered in which she alleges the defendant said, she, the defendant “must have given it to somebody”, and when considering that statement I acknowledge that the tribunal of fact has to take into account that that witness was not cross-examined and that must have an effect on the weight to be given to that document. There is clear evidence of the defendant’s statements on the, well say the following day, that is 27 December, to the Director of Nursing and others. There are other facts relating to  
        [Ms G’s] 
         symptoms and treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        In regard to that we have got the evidence of Dr Braude and Dr Moynham. That evidence leaves no doubt, in my mind, that Mrs  
        [Ms G] 
         was given MS Contin. When considering that I am mindful that it has been submitted, and it is the case of course, that Dr Moynham in his evidence said that he would expect to see symptoms, someone having been given that drug when they were, I think he used the term “naive”. But what is also clear in respect of that evidence to be considered by the Court is that the symptoms come at various times but nobody on 26 December saw any symptoms at all in  
        [Ms G]  
        until she was seen to be in a very distressed state of depressed breathing, such that she was taken to hospital and almost immediately intubated. So that the symptoms had got to an extreme stage at that point and no one had seen anything leading up to it.  
        
       
       
        
        When you weigh all of those things as a tribunal of fact, in my view there can be no doubt, or more correctly put, there can be no other reasonable hypothesis than that the defendant gave  
        [Ms G]  
        the MS Contin on the morning of 26 December when that medication was not prescribed for her. Clearly, the defendant then, apart from mentioning to Nurse Taninaka that she should keep a watch on people, did absolutely nothing to notify either a more senior nurse, whether it be a more senior nurse on duty or the Director of Nursing, or a doctor of that situation or those facts and she did nothing which would be appropriate in observing the patients under her care, one of whom included  
        [Ms G] 
        , for signs and symptoms which would allow proper treatment at the earliest time. In my view, she hasn’t done that, she has neglected to the criminal standard her duty of care. If that is the case the charge against her under s54 is established. 
        
       
      
    22 The relevant findings were, accordingly, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) On the morning of 26 Dec 2000, the plaintiff incorrectly gave MS Contin to Ms G. 
       
       
      (b) Adverse symptoms could come on at an early or at a later time. 
       
       
      (c) No symptoms were observed until Ms G was seen in a very distressed state of depressed breathing. [That was at about 4.45 pm.] 
       
       
      (d) The symptoms had reached “an extreme stage” at that point. 
       
       
      (e) No-one had seen any untoward signs until then. 
       
       
      (f) The plaintiff told Ms T to keep a watch on the residents. [The plaintiff left at about 3 pm.] 
       
       
      (g) Otherwise, the plaintiff did nothing by way of notifying a more senior nurse or a doctor “of that situation or of those facts”, or by way of observing the residents under her care, including Ms G, “for signs and symptoms which would allow proper treatment at the earliest time”. 
       
       
      (h) In so omitting to act, the plaintiff was negligent. 
       
      
    23 Finding (g) was based on the evidence of Ms McCarthy who was another registered nurse employed at the nursing home: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You now know the scenario was that the specific patient couldn’t be identified? 
         
        A. I heard some time quite a long time afterwards that that was the case, but if that was the scenario that particular morning I would have again gone to Linda McGuinness, my director of nursing, immediately to her. We would then have had to go wider of course, we would have had to alert the hospitals and the ambulance, but then immediately with the number of residents that would have been concerned, we would have to immediately observe every single one of them closely because there could have been some adverse effects, there could have been some allergy reactions showing up there, there could have been nausea and further down the line, some several hours later, there could have been respiratory distress and pupils could be pinpoint. 
        
       
      
    24 His Worship was entitled to accept that evidence and it is apparent from finding (g) above that he did. 
     
      
    25 It is not readily apparent what his Worship meant by “that situation or those facts”. 
     
      
    26 Although his Worship described Ms G’s symptoms as having reached “an extreme stage” when they were first observed, there was no finding that there would have been observable symptoms at a materially earlier time. The relevant finding was that the first symptoms could have come on at an early or at a later time. 
     
      
    27 What then were “the situation or facts” which the plaintiff allegedly failed to notify to a more senior nurse or doctor? That can only have been that the drug had been given mistakenly or was suspected to have been given mistakenly to one of the residents other than Mr R, without further particularity. Conformably, his Worship found that the negligence was a failure to observe other residents as well as Ms G. 
     
      
    28 In the absence of a finding that more intensive observation of the residents would have detected Ms G’s condition at a materially earlier time, there was no basis for a finding that informing a more senior nurse or a doctor would have resulted in treatment being instituted for Ms G at a materially earlier time, thereby avoiding the onset of the respiratory depression which constituted grievous bodily harm. Conformably, the learned magistrate made no such finding. 
     
      
    29 The offence was not made out on the findings made by the learned magistrate. In particular, there was no finding of a causal association between the omission as found and the complications constituting grievous bodily harm, and there was no basis for such a finding in the subsidiary findings made by the learned magistrate concerning the events of the day. 
     
      
    30 Additionally, the case found by the learned magistrate was not the case charged. The case charged was that, knowing or suspecting that she had mistakenly given the drug to Ms G in particular, the plaintiff negligently omitted to obtain the appropriate treatment for her to counteract the drug. The case found was that, not knowing to whom the drug had been mistakenly given, the plaintiff negligently omitted to ensure that all the residents were observed for adverse signs so that counteractive treatment could be given if and when one of them showed signs of complications. 
     
      
    31 The appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
    32 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      3. Direct the entry of a verdict of acquittal.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgment of Heydon JA in this matter. I agree with it, both the orders he proposes and his reasons. 
      
       
     2 In the recent decision of Knight v Maclean [2002] NSWCA 314 Heydon JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not the law that a driver complying with the minimum requirements of the law of negligence must drive in such a way as to anticipate everything that a pedestrian might do at all stages of every journey, or to be in a position to reduce speed to levels which will avoid any risk of a collision at all stages of any journey. Yet in the circumstances of the present case the trial judge’s test would entail that duty.” 
         
        
        
       The unsuccessful argument by the appellant in the present case, although presented very attractively by Mr Cox of counsel, runs counter to this clear principle. 
        
       
     3 The appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     4 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     5 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by an unsuccessful plaintiff who claimed damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on 21 February 1998. Balla DCJ dismissed the plaintiff’s claim on 14 December 2001 after a trial on 4-7 and 11 December 2001. 
      
       
     6 At the trial the plaintiff represented herself. The Notice of Appeal was filed by solicitors and the written submissions filed in support of it were prepared by counsel. Those solicitors were dismissed. However, on the appeal, new counsel, Mr E G H Cox, appeared for the plaintiff at short notice. He presented argument on her behalf with impressive ability. 
      
       
        
       The circumstances 
        
       
     7 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The accident occurred at the intersection of Pacific Highway and Cook Drive, Coffs Harbour. Mrs Fogarty had been driving her motor vehicle a Suzuki Hatch along Cook Drive and had stopped behind another vehicle at the T intersection with Pacific Highway intending to turn right. It is common ground that there was a give way sign facing Mrs Fogarty. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Creasey had been travelling along Pacific Highway in a southerly direction in a Ford Falcon. The speed limit was 70 kph. There were two lanes available for southbound traffic and Mr Creasey was in the lane closest to the median strip. He was approaching Mrs Fogarty from her right. After coming over the crest of a small hill the road slopes downwards towards Cook Drive. There was at least 200 metres from the crest of the hill to the intersection with Cook Drive. The roadway is initially straight but at around the point where a left hand turn lane commences, that is 125 metres from Cook Drive, the roads bends to the right if travelling from north to south. That left hand turn lane is an extra lane, forming a third south bound lane.” 
         
        
       
     8 Just before the vehicle in front of the plaintiff had turned right onto the Pacific Highway, two other vehicles (driven by Mrs Jensen and Mr Blackburn) which had been in the Pacific Highway heading north turned right into Cook Drive. The vehicle before the plaintiff, described as a work truck, then turned right to travel up the Pacific Highway, and the plaintiff followed it. The defendant then collided with her.  
      
       
     9 The evidence was confused and conflicting, but the trial judge made the following findings: 
      
       
        
       (a) There was a large vehicle travelling in the kerbside lane on the defendant’s left, but it did not obscure his view at any relevant time. 
        
        
       (b) The defendant “had a clear view down to the intersection with Cook Drive from the point at which he came over the crest of Pacific Highway, being about 200 metres from the intersection.” 
        
        
       (c) The defendant was travelling at 70 kilometres per hour at all relevant times. 
        
        
       (d) The defendant was entitled to assume that the plaintiff would observe the rules of the road – that is, that she would comply with the give way sign controlling traffic moving from Cook Drive onto the Pacific Highway. “[A] vehicle, which has been described as a work truck, did turn right from Cook Drive into Pacific Highway before [the plaintiff], however the fact that it crossed safely, at least as far as [the defendant] is concerned, does not cause me to conclude that this was a situation which should have alerted [the defendant] to the possibility that [the plaintiff] might also try to turn.” 
        
        
       (e) The defendant first saw the plaintiff’s vehicle on the Pacific Highway when it was 20 metres away. He braked immediately on seeing it.  
        
        
       (f) Contrary to a suggestion from the plaintiff that the defendant should not have braked, but continued on and passed in front of her vehicle, “taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances which involve a situation of unexpected danger, I am satisfied that the action taken by [the defendant] was reasonable.” 
        
        
       (g) “It is possible that [the defendant] should have seen [the plaintiff’s] vehicle coming onto the roadway at a slightly earlier time as the diagram that he drew showed [the plaintiff’s] vehicle wholly within the first lane at the time that he first became aware she had left Cook Drive. However there is no satisfactory evidence, including any expert evidence, on which I could form a view that [the defendant] was not driving appropriately in the circumstances or that he could have avoided the collision if he had noticed [the plaintiff’s] vehicle when it first started to enter the intersection.” 
        
       
     10 The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant was in breach of his duty of care. The last passage quoted also contains a finding that even if there was any negligence by the defendant, it was not causative of the collision.  
      
       
        
       The speed of the defendant’s vehicle 
        
       
     11 Grounds 1 and 2 of the Amended Notice of Appeal, and the written submissions filed on behalf of the plaintiff, contended that the finding that the defendant had been travelling at 70 kilometres per hour was erroneous. These grounds were not abandoned by Mr Cox, though he said little about them.  
      
       
     12 The essence of the argument on behalf of the plaintiff on this point was that the trial judge found that the defendant had a clear view of 200 metres from the crest of the hill to Cook Drive and that when Mr Blackburn commenced his right hand turn into Cook Drive there was no oncoming traffic over 200 metres up to the crest of the hill. A car travelling at 70 kilometres per hour travels at 19.5 metres per second. Hence the defendant’s vehicle must have covered the distance from the crest of the hill in a much shorter period of time than about ten seconds if it were to have been unobserved by both Mr Blackburn and the plaintiff. It was said at the trial to follow that the defendant’s car was doing between 103 and 144 kilometres per hour.  
      
       
     13 The trial judge’s conclusion that the defendant’s speed was 70 kilometres per hour was based on an acceptance of evidence to that effect by the defendant, his then wife (a passenger in his vehicle) and Mr Gatenby. The trial judge summarised Mr Gatenby’s evidence thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Gatenby had been driving in the same direction as Mr Creasey. He first became aware of Mr Creasey’s vehicle 5 kilometres from the accident scene. From then on the vehicle was in his view. He was not in a hurry and was obeying the speed limits. The two vehicles travelled through about 8 traffic lights and on occasion they would pull up next to each other when the children in the two vehicles waved to each other. He did not observe Mr Creasey travel in excess of the speed limit. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Gatenby was 4 semi trailer lengths behind Mr Creasey’s vehicle as they approached the intersection and they were both travelling in the left hand lane. He was not aware of any vehicle in front of Mr Creasey’s vehicle. Mr Creasey’s vehicle did not gain speed and they were both travelling at 70 kph.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge rejected Mr Blackburn’s evidence that the defendant had been speeding. Of that evidence, the trial judge said: 
        
        
         
         “Mr Blackburn did form the view that Mr Creasey had been speeding. However he did not look directly at Mr Creasey’s vehicle nor do I understand how he estimated the speed by reference to other traffic when Mr Blackburn also said that there was no other traffic around Mr Creasey’s vehicle. 
         
        
        
         
         I prefer the evidence of Mr Gatenby who had been travelling behind Mr Creasey for some time travelling at the same speed and whose evidence is broadly confirmed by Mr Creasey and his wife. I find that Mr Creasey had been travelling at 70 kph at all relevant times. 
         
        
        
         
         I have not placed much reliance on the evidence of Mr Blackburn. He suggested in his statement that his vehicle would have blocked Mrs Fogarty’s view of Mr Creasey’s vehicle. However neither Mrs Fogarty nor Mr Creasey described their view of the roadway as obscured by a vehicle. The manoeuvre that he described that he performed is difficult to reconcile with the evidence of any other witness.” 
         
        
       
     14 In short, the trial judge rejected Mr Blackburn’s evidence of the defendant’s speed because he was not in a good position to estimate it, and because in other respects his evidence was unreliable. The trial judge accepted the evidence of Mr Gatenby, an independent witness, with good opportunities to observe the defendant’s speed not only at the time of the accident but also for some time earlier. This reasoning is difficult to challenge.  
      
       
     15 The reasoning advanced by the plaintiff in criticism of the trial judge’s conclusion depends on the proposition that the road was clear, to which both the plaintiff and Mr Blackburn testified, was sound, and based on accurate observations by them; or on the proposition that less than ten seconds elapsed between the plaintiff’s decision to turn and the collision. Those propositions are not so compelling that they invalidate the trial judge’s resolution of the conflicts among the witnesses about their direct observations of the defendant’s speed. It is highly unlikely that the road was clear. And ten second was a very long time to elapse between the plaintiff’s decision to turn and the collision.  
      
       
     16 Further, so far as the plaintiff relies on Mr Blackburn’s evidence in contradiction of the witnesses who favoured a speed of 70 kilometres per hour, he estimated the defendant’s speed as being at least 80 kilometres per hour, which is a considerable distance short of the range for which the plaintiff contended.  
      
       
     17 Accordingly these grounds of appeal fail. 
      
       
        
       Was the defendant keeping a proper lookout? 
        
       
     18 Mr Cox submitted that a conclusion that the defendant was not keeping a proper lookout inevitably flowed from two findings of the trial judge: 
      
       
        
       (a) that the defendant had a clear view down to the intersection with Cook Drive from the point at which he came over the crest of the hill about 200 metres away; 
        
        
       (b) that the defendant first saw the plaintiff’s vehicle on the Pacific Highway when it was 20 metres away. 
        
       
     19 Mr Cox’s argument was that as the defendant came over the crest of the hill, he should have noticed the T-junction ahead with shops beyond it, and as he moved down the hill he should have noticed the two cars turning right across his path into Cook Drive. He should have heightened his alertness without necessarily slowing down. He should have seen the two cars waiting to move out of Cook Drive to turn north up the Pacific Highway. When the work truck ahead of the plaintiff came out, he should have begun to slow down because of the advent of possible danger. He gave no evidence to suggest that he did any of these things. 
      
       
     20 Mr Cox relied on Mr Blackburn’s accounts of how the accident happened, but these do not themselves cast light on whether any negligence by the defendant was causative of the accident, even if one puts aside the trial judge’s unhappiness with Mr Blackburn’s evidence and even if one puts aside difficulties about how Mr Blackburn could have seen the defendant in his peripheral vision. 
      
       
     21 Mr Cox supported this submission by referring to evidence by the defendant that he did not see the plaintiff in Cook Drive and that he did not see the cars turning right out of the Pacific Highway into Cook Drive.  
      
       
     22 The trial judge made no findings on when the plaintiff entered the Pacific Highway in relation to the position of the defendant’s vehicle as it moved down the Pacific Highway. The evidence of the defendant’s wife cast no light on that matter. Nor was the evidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant clear on that point. 
      
       
     23 The defendant said, in a written statement made ten months after the accident: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not remember any cars or vehicles close in front of mine, there was plenty of room in front of my vehicle. I was travelling in the lane beside the median strip, I think I would have been in that lane for some time before the accident, because I generally stay in that lane in that sort of area, because you get a fair amount of traffic turning left out of the left lane. 
         
        
        
         
         I was just driving along, I remember seeing a small brown car, a little Suzuki car, about the size of an old Mini, it was a Hatchback thing, in the street on my left. don’t remember seeing any other cars directly in front of this Suzuki now. 
         
        
        
         
         I remember that I could see there was a Give Way sign on the side street, and as far as I am aware every road coming onto the Highway would have either a Give Way or a Stop Sign. I do not remember any other cars turning on that intersection now, as I approached. I just remember seeing the Suzuki on the side road, I do not remember seeing her stopped on the side road. 
         
        
        
         
         I remember only that when I was about from where we are sitting in the back room of this house, to no further than the Bar-B-Que in the back yard from the intersection, when the Suzuki drove out. It was not speeding, it was just driving steadily out of the side road, and I knew straight away I had no chance of stopping or missing her. I agree the distance I have indicated is not more than fifteen to twenty metres. I remember I immediately braked, and called out to Kerry and the girls ‘Hang on.’ I braked as hard as I could, and my car stayed perfectly straight under brakes. I heard the tyres screeching under the heavy braking. There was nothing more I could do. I don’t remember any vehicle directly beside me. I only had time to brake, but no time to even consider any other evasive action before the front of my car hit the driver’s side of the Suzuki. I did not even have any time to swerve, but I would say I would have been in danger of rolling my car if I had attempted that. As I said there was no time to do anything more, and then bang.” 
         
        
       
     24 The plaintiff cross-examined the defendant about that statement. He confirmed the material parts of it.  
      
       
     25 The plaintiff said that she had no recollection of what happened after she decided that the intersection was clear and entered it. Mr Cox drew attention to her evidence in chief and in cross-examination to the effect that she had an actual recollection, before moving onto the Pacific Highway, that it was clear to her right.  
      
       
     26 One difficulty in these arguments is that the trial was fought on different issues from those which the plaintiff now relies on. It was fought on the issues of whether the defendant was driving at excessive speed, and the issue of whether there was a conspiracy between the defendant, his wife, Mr Blackburn and the police. In consequence there was no close cross-examination of the defendant on what precisely he did and did not see as he moved down the road towards Cook Drive.  
      
       
     27 In answer to this problem, Mr Cox pointed out that among the pleaded particulars of negligence were the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “(ii) Failing to heed the presence of the Plaintiff’s vehicle on the roadway … . 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Failing to keep a proper lookout. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) Failing to approach a major intersection with caution … .” 
         
        
       
     28 Mr Cox submitted that though the plaintiff, appearing in person, had not concentrated the focus of the trial on these allegations, she had advanced them, she was entitled to have them dealt with, and the trial judge had not dealt with them.  
      
       
        
       The defendant’s arguments 
        
       
     29 The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
       (a) The burden of proof of want of care on the part of the defendant, and of causation, was on the plaintiff. 
        
        
       (b) While a driver cannot assume that in all circumstances other road users will obey the law and drive carefully, it is proper to assume that they will unless there is some trigger to make the driver realise that they may not. 
        
        
       (c) Whether the defendant showed a want of care based on failure to keep a proper lookout by reason of not heeding the presence of the plaintiff on the Pacific Highway and by failing to approach Cook Drive with caution depended on the timing of the movements of Mrs Jensen, Mr Blackburn, the work truck in front of the plaintiff and the plaintiff in relation to the movements of the defendant. 
        
        
       (d) The evidence was insufficiently precise to permit any conclusions to be drawn as to how long Mrs Jensen’s turn took, how long Mr Blackburn’s turn took, how long the work truck’s turn took, when the plaintiff commenced to move onto the Pacific Highway after having waited in a stationary position behind the work truck, and what positions the defendant had reached on the Pacific Highway at the time of each of these events.  
        
        
       (e) The plaintiff’s evidence that just before she turned she saw a clear road to the north cannot have been correct, or if she did she cannot have observed the road properly, because the road was not clear and if it had been the accident would not have happened. 
        
        
       (f) Nothing in what the defendant saw put him on notice that the plaintiff was about to execute a risky manoeuvre, and there was nothing else in the scene to suggest that it might be perilous for him to continue driving as he was. 
        
        
       (g) The only perilous element in the chain of events was the plaintiff’s decision, made after three other vehicles had safely executed, or were safely executing, their turns, to move out into the path of the defendant. 
        
        
       (h) Even if the defendant should have observed the various vehicles, and in particular the plaintiff’s vehicle, earlier than he did, and was in that sense in breach of duty, as a matter of causation it could not be inferred that if he had been keeping a satisfactory lookout he would have received enough notice of the plaintiff’s manoeuvre to avoid the accident. 
        
       
     30 There is, however, one submission which counsel for the defendant did not put. He did not submit that the plaintiff should not be allowed to run her case differently on appeal from the way it had been run at the trial. He took this stance for the reason that the plaintiff was unrepresented at trial and it was not “entirely edifying” to be strict about the matter. That circumstance alone would not justify non-compliance on the plaintiff’s part with fundamental procedural rules of civil litigation such as the rule that parties may not advance on appeal a case not advanced at trial. However, just as counsel for the plaintiff had frankly conceded that the appeal turned on a substantially new case, so counsel for the defendant frankly conceded that he was not prejudiced. In any event, the point had been taken in the pleadings, some of the evidence tendered bore on the point, and the trial judge appeared to consider the point to be still alive when she said that it was possible that the defendant should have seen the plaintiff’s vehicle coming onto the road at a slightly earlier time.  
      
       
     31 In these circumstances it is appropriate to consider the merits of the plaintiff’s new case.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     32 The defendant did not give evidence from which it could be inferred that he had been keeping a satisfactory lookout as he came down the hill. He must be taken to have been on notice of the issue, raised as it was by the particulars of negligence in the Statement of Claim. In chief he said nothing either way about what he saw at Cook Drive or the gap in the median strip facing it. According to his evidence in chief, the first he saw of the plaintiff was just before he braked and hit her. The statement he prepared ten months after the accident leaves it obscure as to whether he saw the plaintiff’s car twice (once stationary in Cook Drive and later moving onto the Pacific Highway across his path) or once (moving onto the Pacific Highway across his path). In cross-examination he said that while he saw the work truck in front of her go across (a fact not referred to in the statement made ten months after the accident, though it was referred to in the statement made to the police on the day of the accident) he only saw her once, namely while she was crossing in front of him. He said he did not see the vehicles of Mrs Jensen and Mr Blackburn. Since the last of these two vehicles passed in front of the work truck, his attention to what was happening can only have become focused when the work truck began moving. This suggests he had failed to keep a satisfactory lookout up to that point. To that extent the trial judge’s statement that there “is no satisfactory evidence” that the defendant “was not driving appropriately in the circumstances” is incorrect. To that extent the defendant was in breach of duty. 
      
       
     33 However, the plaintiff’s manoeuvre can only have commenced about the time the works van moved onto the Pacific Highway. At 70 kilometres per hour, the defendant was covering over 19 metres per second. He estimated that he saw the plaintiff about 20 metres away, and braked. That he braked is corroborated by other witnesses observing a puff of smoke from his tyres. Though the distance may have seemed to him to be only 20 metres, he must have observed the plaintiff from a greater distance, for, if one assumes, as one must, a reaction time of any significant duration at all, he would not have had time to brake before the collision if the plaintiff was only 20 metres away. Assuming that the defendant had kept a proper lookout, the crucial question is when he would have been put on notice of the plaintiff’s manoeuvre by its commencement. The onus lay on the plaintiff to prove causation: that is, to prove that her manoeuvre gave the defendant sufficient notice either to react to the crisis, brake, and bring his vehicle to a halt before it hit hers or to react to the crisis by adopting some other manoeuvre. The plaintiff submitted that the defendant’s correct reaction would have been not to brake. Not to have braked would appear to have been a risky decision, contrary to the natural human instinct to brake in a crisis. The trial judge’s rejection of the plaintiff’s criticism of the decision not to brake is thus sound. But either way, the trial judge said that there was “no satisfactory evidence, including any expert evidence” on which she could conclude that the defendant “could have avoided the collision if he had noticed [the plaintiff’s] vehicle when it first started to enter the intersection”. That conclusion has not been shown to be wrong, and it appears to be correct.  
      
       
     34 It would seem unlikely that the plaintiff’s turn onto the Pacific Highway had been in progress for long before the defendant saw her – not long enough to permit the accident to have been avoided even if he had seen the commencement of the turn. It would be necessary to reach a view as to the defendant’s reaction time and form a view as to how long in addition it would have taken his brakes to operate, and measure the sum of those two times against the time between the moment when the plaintiff commenced her turn and the moment of collision. There was neither direct evidence (reliable or not), nor circumstantial evidence, nor expert evidence, to permit investigation of that kind.  
      
       
        
       Failure of the trial judge to deal with the pleaded case 
        
       
     35 As has been seen, the plaintiff complained that the trial judge erred by not dealing with paragraph (ii), (iv) and (v) of the particulars of negligence and with related issues. 
      
       
     36 To this complaint there are several answers.  
      
       
     37 First, a trial judge cannot be criticised if the parties by their conduct of the trial narrow the pleaded issues. The issues of a trial can expand, even without an amendment to the pleadings; they can contract too. It seems likely that because of the plaintiff’s concentration on speed and conspiracy, that happened in this case.  
      
       
     38 Secondly, the trial judge did deal with the issues, though very briefly, when she said that it was possible that the defendant should have seen the plaintiff’s vehicle coming onto the roadway at a slightly earlier time. But she rejected that possibility as an avenue of liability on the causation grounds discussed above. 
      
       
     39 Thirdly, even if the trial judge failed to deal with the issues, any attempt by her to do so would have led inevitably to the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim, because even though the allegations of breach of duty appear valid, the plaintiff failed to prove that they caused her loss for the reasons indicated above.

       The plaintiff sustained physical injuries when she was struck by the defendant’s motor car as the defendant drove along a road which the plaintiff attempted to cross on foot. The plaintiff sued in tort alleging that the defendant drove negligently, failing to keep a proper lookout. The primary judge found in favour of the plaintiff but reduced the sum of damages awarded on the basis of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence in attempting to cross the road while intoxicated and herself taking adequate precautions for her own safety. Contributory fault was assessed at 40%. 
        
        
       The defendant appealed as to liability and alternatively as to apportionment of fault. 
        
        
       Held 
        (Heydon JA, Meagher JA and Young CJ in Eq agreeing), allowing the appeal: 
        
        
       The defendant did not owe the plaintiff the alleged duty of care. Although the movement of pedestrians at some speed across the road was reasonably foreseeable, the appearance of the plaintiff at a fast walk was not a particular risk or danger which was perceivable, observable or apparent: [62]-[64].

       The defendant’s driving satisfied conventional criteria for safe driving by maintaining a modest speed, moving with the flow of traffic, maintaining a reasonable distance from the vehicle in front and keeping a proper lookout. He was entitled to concentrate on looking straight ahead until he noticed something to the left which called for greater concentration on the left. A finding of liability in these circumstances would create a form of strict liability, not recognise a form of liability in negligence: [65]-[70].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     2 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by an unsuccessful defendant against a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $150,494.40 given by Dent DCJ, QC, on 15 November after a trial on 13 and 14 November 2001. The damages were compensation for injuries suffered when a car driven by the defendant hit her at about 9.10pm on 5 November 1997 whilst she crossing a busy road. The damages were reduced by 40% in consequence of her contributory negligence. 
      
       
     3 The appeal raises two points. The first is whether the trial judge was correct in holding the defendant negligent, which raises both factual controversies and controversies as to the standard of care stipulated by the trial judge. The second point is whether the apportionment for contributory negligence was correct.  
      
       
        
       The trial judge’s reasons for judgment: liability 
        
       
     4 At the time of the accident the defendant was nearly 72. He died just before the trial. The principal witnesses were the plaintiff and an independent witness who observed the accident from her house on the other side of the road.  
      
       
     5 The trial judge described the accident scene as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The facts of the subject accident involve first of all a close examination of the scene. It occurred in lane three of Parramatta Road according to the reconstruction of the attending police about twenty metres to the east of Palace Street and seven metres onto the carriageway and in lane three. Parramatta Road at that point is about the crest of what is known as the Taverners Hill. It is a three lane road in each direction divided by a narrow median strip, overhead street lighting is provided and the road is kerbed and guttered with a pavement on each side of the road. The surface is bitumen. There are lane lines marking out three lanes in either direction.  
         
        
        
         
         To the east of the scene of the subject accident is Norton Street, Leichhardt, a substantial intersection controlled by traffic control lights and Palace Street, by photographs which form part of exhibit A, is demonstrated to be a quite wide street which is a two-way street but where it enters Parramatta Road is a T-intersection that permits traffic to leave it only by a left turn into Parramatta Road. 
         
        
        
         
         The general aspect of the scene of the accident from the point of view of the driver proceeding west in Parramatta Road is an open aspect. The pedestrian concerned, the plaintiff, was in the vicinity of a street light at Palace Street and she was wearing light blue jeans and a pink sweater top which was a long sleeved one.” 
         
        
        
       To the extent that the second paragraph of this passage suggests that Palace Street was east of the accident site, it is erroneous: the correct position is stated in the first paragraph.  
        
       
     6 It was common ground that the plaintiff was a theatre nurse who worked at Westmead Children’s Hospital. She was nearly 29. During the day her neck became painful and she was sent home. She received treatment from a chiropractor but her neck remained stiff and painful. This meant she could not turn her neck left or right, but had to turn her entire torso to look in either direction. She went to a home unit occupied by two men whom she knew. She estimated that while there she drank four cans of beer, but an analysis of a sample of her blood taken about 45 minutes after the accident revealed that it contained 0.249 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. An investigating police officer said she noticed an extremely strong smell of liquor coming out of the back of the ambulance in which the plaintiff was placed after the accident. She also said of that blood alcohol reading that it revealed “an extremely high level of intoxication”. She further said that one of the plaintiff’s companions was “heavily intoxicated”, having slurred speech, needing support to stand up, being unsteady on his feet and smelling of alcohol. The independent witness thought the plaintiff was drunk, could hardly walk in a straight line, was “leaning all over the cars that were parked in the kerbside”, and could not stand by herself. In view of one of the defendant’s arguments on appeal, it is necessary to record an observation of the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “I make the obvious comment, from years and years of listening to evidence of this nature, that the four beers must have been the four most potent that the plaintiff had ever drunk. The plaintiff herself described herself in evidence as a little drunk and I see no reason to doubt that description the plaintiff gives of herself.” 
         
        
        
       A little later the trial judge said that the pain of her neck “may have been somewhat subdued by the liquid medicine that she had taken”.  
        
       
     7 Her male friends, whom she herself described as quite drunk, wanted her to stay at the home unit, but she wanted to go home because she had to work the next day. The home unit was in Palace Street. They walked down Palace Street in a northerly direction to Parramatta Road, where she intended to hail a taxi and go west along Parramatta Road to her home in Summer Hill. There were no taxis proceeding west, but there were vacant taxis going east. After she and her friends engaged in a noisy altercation, one of them hailed an eastbound taxi and caused it to stop. He crossed the road. She then crossed the road in a northerly direction in order to get into the taxi. She was then struck by a vehicle being driven by the defendant in lane three, the lane nearest to the median strip, while he headed west.  
      
       
     8 The trial judge drew attention to the fact that there were differences between a statement provided to a police officer by the defendant on the day of the accident and the contents of a tape recorded interview between an insurance investigator and the defendant about six months after the accident, on 16 May 1998. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It goes without saying that that version of the accident presented on 16 May 1998, well after the collision, is a significantly different version to that which Mr Knight proffered to the constable on the evening of the accident. Significant in this way, that on the evening of the accident he simply spoke of a female walking in front of his car from the number two lane, and absent from any account on the night of the accident, was any suggestion that his potential view of the pedestrian was obscured by any other car. The later statement asserts that the plaintiff moved in front of that other car which he saw had braked somewhat and the later statement asserts the plaintiff was running, an assertion that he did not make on the night of the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         I would comment that this disparity in the accounts of how the accident occurred would have offered counsel for the plaintiff a very fertile field of cross-examination to determine what degree of attention Mr Knight was really paying to the footpath area and the lanes to the left of him as he proceeded along the Parramatta Road that night. 
         
        
        
         
         The later statement is also significant in that it is quite clear that at its conclusion he was asked ‘Do you have the details of any other witnesses’, bearing in mind that he did not have the details of the driver in lane two that he asserted had stopped but he asserted the police did have them. And he said, ‘I do have the name and address of two that offered to be a witness if required, yes’. ‘Are you able to supply me with these before I leave’ he was asked. He said ‘Yes’.” 
         
        
       
     9 The trial judge described the evidence of the independent witness, whose residential unit looked south across Parramatta Road, thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “She went to the terrace and there she saw three people having an argument on the opposite side of the road, two males and a female who proved to be the plaintiff. She said she stayed on the balcony and they argued for probably ten minutes. They were on the footpath when she first saw them. She said that one of the males left the group to cross Parramatta Road to her side and that the other male proceeded west. Her vision of the male who had crossed the road was obscured but she saw a taxi pull up where he was. She then described the plaintiff as having suddenly bolted out from the kerb between two parked cars straight out onto Parramatta Road diagonally. She said that one car passed her and that the plaintiff was looking west and walked straight on. She thought from her observations that the plaintiff was drunk and she described her as walking into lane three, straight into the oncoming car were her words initially but then she explained that seconds passed before the vehicle in lane two had passed and the plaintiff was struck by the vehicle in lane three. She described the defendant’s vehicle as stopping quite quickly and in cross-examination she agreed that by ‘bolted’ she meant that the pedestrian went from a stationary position to a quick walk, that she didn’t start slowly, that it was like she had a mission to get to the other side and that she kept walking quickly, starting at a slight angle. She said that the plaintiff was standing right in front of her. A gym near the corner of Palace Street and her account of course does not stand with the account given by Mr Knight in his recorded interview with Mr Alan Sheppard because it is quite clear from her account that in passing across the road the plaintiff walked to the rear or behind the car in lane two, onwards into lane three.” 
         
        
       
     10 In the part of his reasons for judgment dealing with liability, the trial judge said that the plaintiff was “an essentially honest witness”. In the parts of his reasons for judgment dealing with damages he said she was a witness of truth, “in no sense whatever a case maker or an exaggerator”, “not a case maker and not a liar, and an understater rather than an overstater of the problems that she suffers”, and “an honest woman”. The trial judge’s summary of her evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “they were standing at the end of a number of parked cars and one of the men ran across to get a taxi and got it, that she then walked from the line of parked cars to the margin of lanes two and three, that she had looked right before crossing to that point and that she looked right again at that point and she could not see any cars so she continued. To look to the right it was necessary for her to turn her whole body as she was suffering from a stiff neck so she would of necessity have to turn her torso rather than her head on her neck to look. She thought that they had been waiting for a cab between ten and fifteen minutes and that when she took her look from the margin between lane two and three she saw cars some metres down the road and inferentially thought it safe to cross and so did, walking into the path of the vehicle which hit her. She expanded on her movements in chief by explaining that she had looked right and let one car go past her in lane two and that she did not see the vehicle that struck her before it struck her, that her leg action was a quick walk, not running.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge said that evidence was not changed in cross-examination.  
        
       
     11 The trial judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Part of exhibit A is a road map of the Parramatta Road which shows the relationship of Palace Street to the area. The Parramatta Road itself is a road largely fronted by businesses of various kinds including restaurants. The areas to the north and south of Parramatta Road are a mixture, from my knowledge, of small businesses and residential streets. The street Palace Street is a street into which a series of other streets feed all the way back to the railway line which proceeds from Central to Parramatta. It is, in my judgment, an area where one could anticipate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at the hour of the day when this subject accident occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         Balancing all the known facts, the accounts of the eye witnesses and the different accounts of Mr Knight, the defendant, I am driven firmly to the conclusion that in the seconds prior to the subject accident occurring Mr Knight was driving his motor vehicle without showing the degree of vigilance and look-out that is demanded of a motorist using the public highway because in law the motorist does not enjoy a right of way in respect of a pedestrian crossing the road any more than the pedestrian enjoys a right of way against the motorist proceeding down the road. The available cone of vision to a motorist travelling in lane three is a superior one to that of a motorist travelling in lane two as far as observations of pedestrians seeking to cross the road are concerned. Palace Street was an intersection in the immediate vicinity of the subject accident. The long experience of mankind that intersections are places where one is more likely to encounter pedestrians and vehicle traffic is surely reflected in the somewhat out of date but nonetheless still current regulations under the  
         Metropolitan Traffic Act 
          which require the driver of the vehicle to reduce his speed to walking pace at intersections and in certain other instances. The reasonable motorist on a highway such as the Parramatta Road is not entitled to expect that pedestrians will allow him or her right of way. He must drive in anticipation of a pedestrian crossing the road in such a fashion as to require him to adjust his speed downwards if he and the pedestrian were to continue. 
         
        
        
         
         I am satisfied that there was a significant lack of observation by [the defendant] on the evening in question and that had [the defendant] been observant he would have seen the pedestrian significantly before he did and been able to sharply reduce his speed to one that would avoid a collision or minimise the effect of it. What happened here was that he hit the pedestrian when his vehicle was possessed of so much forward energy that it was able to propel the pedestrian’s body to rest quite some distance down the road in front of his vehicle. 
         
        
        
         
         I turn now to the position of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was on her own view a little bit drunk and, on any view of the amount of ethanol in her bloodstream, in a state where she would have reduced her capacity to form a sound judgment as to the danger that vehicular traffic along the Parramatta Road might pose to her at a time when she exercised her right to cross the road on foot. Had she not been in that condition she would in my view have seen that Mr Knight’s vehicle was sufficiently close to her intended path to cause her to realise that Mr Knight would have to slow down if she continued crossing. The plaintiff of course attributes part of her difficulties to the fact that she had a stiff neck and I have not the faintest doubt that she did have a stiff neck and a painful neck on the night concerned, although the pain may have been somewhat subdued by the liquid medicine that she had taken. Nonetheless the problem of the alcohol was there. She must be in law judged by the standard of the ordinary reasonable pedestrian unaffected by alcohol, and that person is required to make judgments based upon proper observations as to whether or not it is reasonably safe to cross a carriageway on foot. This plaintiff’s judgment in my view was significantly impaired at that time. She quite clearly did not see Mr Knight’s vehicle driving down towards that area. It was, on the view of the independent eye witness, some seconds in travel to the rear of the vehicle in lane two but I am satisfied from the photographic exhibits that it was there to be seen and Miss Maclean did not see it and that she should have seen it and this failure to accurately observe amounts to a state of affairs which is contributory negligence. The defendant in my view has proved the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence which has contributed to the damages that she sustained.” 
         
        
        
       The defendant’s factual arguments on appeal in relation to liability 
        
       
     12 Counsel for the defendant submitted that the trial judge “uncritically accepted the evidence of the [plaintiff] without reconciling the internal inconsistencies within that evidence and the conflict between that evidence and that of the only independent witness … .” Counsel submitted that the trial judge’s finding that the plaintiff was honest was not protected by principles which make it difficult to attack the credit-based findings of trial judges on appeal, because there was unchallenged objective evidence of the plaintiff’s unreliability. Counsel submitted that the trial judge “dismissed entirely” the evidence of the defendant, but instead of concentrating on the differences between his two statements, should have noted the significant correlation between them and the rest of the evidence, particularly that of the independent witness. It was submitted that it was natural that the second statement, taken over a lengthier period, would contain detail which was not in the first statement. The trial judge failed to note - 
      
       
        
       (a) that the fact that the defendant was travelling at 60 kilometres an hour was not in issue; 
        
        
       (b) that the existence of a car in lane two was supported by both the independent witness and the plaintiff; 
        
        
       (c) the availability of the driver of the car in lane two was confirmed by the police officer; 
        
        
       (d) the contention in the second statement that the plaintiff was “running” was confirmed by the evidence of the independent witness that she “bolted” in the sense of proceeding at “a quick moving walk” and “went straight out very quickly”.  
        
       
     13 Counsel for the defendant did accept that while the defendant recalled the plaintiff appearing in lane three, having passed in front of the car in lane two, the independent witness said she came from behind the car in lane two. It was submitted “that this discrepancy does not derogate from the essential burden of the evidence, ie that the [plaintiff’s] presence was masked by another car in the second lane, that she did not stop, that she was moving quickly and walked straight into the lane in which the [defendant] was travelling.” It was conceded that the independent witness was correct and that the defendant was wrong in saying that the plaintiff crossed the road in front of, rather than behind, the car in the second lane.  
      
       
     14 Counsel for the defendant then said that the police evidence was that the plaintiff’s blood alcohol reading revealed “an extremely high level of intoxication, referred to the independent witness’s evidence, and said that the trial judge sought to trivialise this problem in the [plaintiff’s] evidence without coming to terms with its obvious false nature”.  
      
       
     15 Counsel for the defendant then drew attention to an important difference between the evidence of the plaintiff and the evidence of the independent witness. The evidence of the plaintiff was that she looked to the right before beginning to cross the road, allowed the car in the second lane to pass, moved into the second lane, looked to the right again, saw nothing coming, moved into the third lane and was then struck by the defendant’s vehicle. On the other hand, the independent witness said that the respondent walked quickly across the road and did not at any time stop or look to the right, but only to the left. Counsel for the defendant submitted that the question of negligence should have been considered on the basis that the independent witness was correct.  
      
       
        
       Factual issues: general 
        
       
     16 It is not correct to say that the trial judge “dismissed entirely” the defendant’s evidence. It would be truer to say that he by-passed or did not deal with or vacillated about resolving the conflicts between the defendant’s evidence and other evidence, particularly on the question whether the plaintiff moved in front of the car in the second lane or behind it.  
      
       
     17 Nor is it correct to say that the trial judge trivialised the plaintiff’s drunkenness. The trial judge perhaps attempted to let the plaintiff down gently and attempted to deal with the issue with humour, though perhaps not with successful humour. But the point of the humour turned on his perception that there was in fact a high degree of intoxication, as there obviously was. He placed significant reliance on it as part of his reasoning in reducing the damages for contributory negligence. 
      
       
     18 It is also not correct to suggest, as the defendant’s submissions did, that the trial judge gave unqualified preference to the plaintiff over the defendant and over the independent witness. Rather, again, he tended to sidestep or by-pass or vacillate about resolving the precise differences to be found among the evidence.  
      
       
     19 One other factual matter may be put aside. Counsel for the defendant contended in writing that the trial judge had summarised the independent witness’s evidence incorrectly and misunderstood it. The matter was debated orally, but counsel for the defendant did not demonstrate that his criticism was either sound or significant. 
      
       
        
       Did the trial judge make any finding on the issue of whether the plaintiff looked right? 
        
       
     20 The principal difference of significance between the plaintiff’s evidence and the evidence of the independent witness turned on whether, as the plaintiff said, she looked right, saw the car in the second lane, allowed it to pass, moved to a point between the second and third lanes, looked right again, did not see the defendant and moved forward before being hit; or whether, as the independent witness said, the plaintiff moved straight from the side of the road across lane one and lane two before being hit in lane three. (There were two other minor differences: the plaintiff said that she crossed the first lane by moving past the first of four parked cars on her right, there being no parked cars on her left, while the independent witness said the plaintiff came out between parked cars. And the plaintiff suggested that she moved straight across the road, while the independent witness said she moved diagonally. These were not differences of any significance to the decision of the case. As to the first, it was common ground that, viewed from the defendant’s perspective, at least part of the plaintiff’s body would have been obscured by parked cars. As to the other difference, the precise angle does not appear to have increased or reduced the chance of collision.) 
      
       
     21 The plaintiff’s evidence on the significant point of difference was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And where did you go then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Turned right on to Parramatta Road, and they were trying to talk me into not going yet, and – was standing on the first lane, there was some cars parked there. We were just talking for a little while. I was waiting for a taxi of course, they were all on the other side. And then one of the men ran across and got a taxi on the other side of the road. So I tried to get across as well. I let a car go past, and then I went across that second lane, and then I looked to my right again, I had to turn my whole body, I couldn’t see any cars, I had a good view, and that was the last thing I recall. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You also said in your long answer when describing what happened that when you turned you turned your whole body, why was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because the right side of my neck was sore. I was feeling a little bit dizzy at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now when you did look to your right what, if anything, did you notice about the traffic conditions? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Wasn’t that heavy, and there wasn’t anything for a few metres down the road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was when I was in the second lane, when I turned my whole body around, there was no car coming. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when did you start moving in relation to the time that Colin probably went across the road? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was after I looked to the right, and one car went past, I let the car go past, and then when I went to cross the third lane – I turned and I didn’t see anything coming and I crossed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which way did you turn? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To the right. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see the defendant’s car before it struck you or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I didn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now when you were moving across the road, can you describe your leg action? 
         
        
        
         
         A. My leg action? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mm. 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was a quick walk. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did it ever get to be more than that or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you run or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     22 In cross-examination she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. As I understand your evidence you said that because of your problems with your neck and when you were looking at anything to your right you had to turn your body round, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you say, as I recall your evidence, that’s what in fact you did this evening -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. – before you proceeded into the third lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were nearly struck by a vehicle in the second lane weren’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I let the vehicle go past. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you proceeded from behind, if I can put it this way, or in front of a parked vehicle in the left hand lane, you were standing towards the kerb as you’ve said in front of a vehicle parked at the kerb side lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You moved out into the second lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Missed very closely a car in the second lane, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I let the car go past and then I crossed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It nearly collected you didn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well it came very close didn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I let it go past and then I went and then I stopped. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you say you let this vehicle go past and then you moved what across the middle lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. One, two and three thank you your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Lane one I’d crossed, lane two I let the car go past, right across and then I was in the middle of between lane two and three and I’ve turned around and there was nothing coming and I crossed -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you proceeded across lane two before you looked right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now you’ve said [you saw] nothing for a few metres? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You looked to the right, there was nothing for a few metres? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s as far as you could see? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then you proceeded across or into lane three, in the middle of lane three and you were struck is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     23 Later she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And in fact one of those vehicles had just passed you before you moved into the third carriageway? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You moved into the second lane after one of those vehicles had passed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then into the third lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you move immediately into the second lane after the vehicle had passed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Into the second lane yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see what I want to put to you is that, that you had consumed quite an amount of alcohol that evening, more than four cans, what do you say to that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that you were well affected by alcohol by the time you travelled across Parramatta Road, walked across Parramatta Road, what do you say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That you were unsteady on your feet? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was due to my neck, I wasn’t – I remember what happened. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you agree you were unsteady on your [feet] do you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Maybe I was a little bit off balance. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that you proceeded from lane one across two and three without looking to your right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That you proceeded very quickly, what do you say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t run. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Alright well did you jog or how did you travel? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The lanes are quite small, after I got past the second one I looked unless that time from looking there and then turning around to walk if the car came in that time that’s what happened. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that the reason you were in a hurry is you wanted to catch the cab that your friend had flagged down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And was getting into at the other side of the road is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were in a hurry to join your friend in the taxi at the other side of the road? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wasn’t in that much of a hurry that I was going to risk my life. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well if you [were] conscious that there were passages of time when there was traffic proceeding and there was a gap in the traffic, why didn’t you wait for the gap? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because I looked and there wasn’t a car and they’re all different lanes and cars go different speeds. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see one of the reasons that you may not have looked to the right was because of your neck is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I turned my whole body, I was extra cautious I thought.” 
         
        
       
     24 In that last passage counsel for the defendant twice put to the plaintiff that she did not look to the right. That part of the cross-examination was neither lengthy nor successful, but it did put the defendant’s case on the point.  
      
       
     25 The defendant’s case was again put at the conclusion of the cross-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And madam you see when you moved across lanes two and three your attention was focussed on the cab on the other side of the road wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. When I was crossing the road yes, but before I crossed the road I looked, I’ve got to look straight ahead when I’m walking but I did look. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what you were more concerned about was the traffic travelling the opposite direction on the other side of the carriageway where the cab was? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     26 The independent witness’s evidence was quite different from the plaintiff’s: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What did you see then. Did she walk, did she run? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No she, she bolted out from the kerbside which was, had parked cars in it. So she came between two – parked cars, and just went straight out – onto Parramatta Road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Then what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well as she – she was, she didn’t cross directly, like in a straight line, she crossed diagonally, and so she walked in a diagonal line across. She – one car passed her and then after that car passed her she was looking to the west and walked in front of the car coming on the third lane, which is the middle lane. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So when you say looking west, that is in the opposite direction to the vehicle that was travelling and struck her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, she was looking the opposite direction.” 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The car that passed her, how long had it passed her before she proceeded across the lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well she continued, straight away, there was no – she didn’t stop she just walked straight, after that car passed. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did the car pass close to her or did it pass some distance before she moved? 
         
        
        
         
         A Close to her. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you make any observations of the demeanour of this lady prior to her being struck by the vehicle? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I thought she was drunk.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why did you think that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, the way she was walking, she could hardly walk in a straight line. She was leaning all over the cars that were parked in the kerbside. She didn’t actually stand by herself – when she was talking to the other two gentlemen. That’s why I was concerned about her when she -- 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In any event you saw -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. She seemed to me to be drunk. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Those observations, did that cause you … to continue to make observations after that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember when she moved into lane three, how far away the vehicle was from her that struck her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well she – she walked straight into – it was immediate. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. She walked straight into -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. The oncoming car. 
         
        
        
         
         GRANT: Q. How long had passed before the vehicle in lane two had passed and she was struck by the vehicle in lane three? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I would say it would be seconds.” 
         
        
       
     27 That evidence in chief indicated that the plaintiff did not look right, towards the defendant’s vehicle, only west, in the opposite direction; and she did not stop at any stage from the kerbside to the point of impact. The evidence in chief was not challenged in cross-examination; rather, its accuracy in those respects was accepted in the following series of questions, most of them leading: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When you said that Miss Maclean bolted out from the kerbside, have you ever described it differently to that before? 
         
        
        
         
         A. By bolted, I mean she, from a stationary point she just suddenly went straight across the road. She went from a stationary point to a quick moving walk.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. So she was standing still and then she commenced to walk and she kept walking until the time she was struck by the car, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She – it’s like when someone has a mission to do something, to get to the other side, they just go – she didn’t start off slowly she just completely just, went straight out very quickly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. She walked quickly did she? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes she walked quickly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that’s the situation that one moment she was standing at the kerb? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then she commenced walking quickly from the beginning? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then she commenced walking quickly until she was struck? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say that she crossed diagonally, at what angle do you mean, if you compare it with crossing directly, was it at a slight angle to the direct 90 degrees? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She started off at a slight angle but went down progressively down that angle. So what she did is, cross the road at – a straight line but at an angle, if you know what I mean. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So far as the car that went past Mrs Maclean is concerned, is this how you would describe that. That that car went past her. She watched that car and then she crossed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, yes that’s right.” 
         
        
       
     28 An overnight adjournment then took place, but the cross-examiner did not return to the subject the following day. These tactics may well have been sound, proceeding from a perception that to exacerbate and highlight a direct collision of credibility between the plaintiff, who had much to gain from the litigation and whose powers of perception and memory might well be held to have been impaired by drink, and an independent sober witness with no tie of blood, affection or interest to either party might, if it was decided against the plaintiff, damage the plaintiff’s credibility and her interests in relation to other questions. If that was the tactical approach, it enjoyed success, in view of the trial judge’s numerous favourable references to the plaintiff’s honesty and fortitude. 
      
       
     29 The trial judge made no explicit finding about whether the plaintiff looked to the right and about whether she paused between the second and third lanes. If she looked, she must have paused, because the condition of her back made it necessary to turn not merely her neck, but her whole torso, which would have made it difficult for her to continue walking quickly.  
      
       
     30 There are indications that the trial judge assumed, or impliedly found, that the plaintiff’s evidence was correct. 
      
       
        
       (a) The trial judge said that had the plaintiff not been affected by drink, “she would in my view have seen that Mr Knight’s vehicle was sufficiently close to her intended path to cause her to realise that Mr Knight would have to slow down if she continued crossing”. This implies that her failure to appreciate the danger stemmed from the fact that her drunkenness frustrated an attempt to observe the car, rather than from the fact that she did not even try to observe the car. 
        
        
       (b) The trial judge said that the plaintiff’s “judgment … was significantly impaired at that time. She quite clearly did not see Mr Knight’s vehicle driving down towards that area”. This suggests that the reason the plaintiff did not see was that though she looked, her ability to see was impaired significantly.  
        
        
       (c) The trial judge said that the defendant’s car “was there to be seen and Miss Maclean did not see it and … she should have seen it, and this failure to accurately observe amounts to a state of affairs which is contributory negligence”. The words “failure to accurately observe” suggest an attempt to observe which miscarried, rather than a failure even to attempt observation.  
        
       
     31 On the other hand, there are contrary indications – that is, there are passages in which the trial judge assumed that the time when the defendant ought to have seen the car was the time when she was commencing her journey across the road as distinct from when she was apparently standing between lanes two and three. This flows from the fact that if the plaintiff had stood there and turned to look, it would have been astonishing if the defendant had not seen her. 
      
       
        
       (a) The trial judge said: 
        
        
         
          
           
           “The available cone of vision to a motorist travelling in lane three is a superior one to one of a motorist travelling in lane two as far as observations of pedestrians seeking to cross the road are concerned.” 
           
          
         
        
        
        This implies that the defendant was found liable not because he failed to notice the plaintiff almost in front of him, but because he failed to notice the plaintiff commencing her journey from the kerb and moving across lanes one and two. Had the trial judge accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that she was stationary between lanes two and three, it would have been possible to find the defendant in breach of duty without worrying about a cone of vision extending to the kerb.  
        
        
       (b) The trial judge said that a reasonable motorist “must drive in anticipation of a pedestrian crossing the road in such a fashion as to enable him to adjust his speed downwards if he and the pedestrian were to continue”. This formulation of the duty stresses not the duty of drivers to see what is ahead of them, but the duty of drivers to anticipate what may happen to their sides.  
        
       
     32 Thus there has been no explicit finding about a key aspect of the way the accident happened, and the trial judge appears to have acted on contradictory assumptions about it. This would not matter if the controversy in question was legally irrelevant. But it is not legally irrelevant, because if the plaintiff’s evidence were correct, the defendant would have had an opportunity for observation making a finding of negligence much more likely. 
      
       
     33 The failure of the trial judge to confront and explicitly resolve the conflict between the evidence of the plaintiff and the evidence of the independent witness might ordinarily call for an order that there be a new trial. Here, however, the failure of counsel for the plaintiff to cross-examine the independent witness by endeavouring to obtain concessions to the contrary of the independent witness’s evidence in chief and consistent with the plaintiff’s evidence is significant. It is even more significant that the leading questions in cross-examination of counsel for the plaintiff assumed the accuracy of the independent witness’s evidence in chief and the incorrectness of the plaintiff’s evidence, as if there were no issue on the point. It cannot be assumed that the independent witness had been in court during the plaintiff’s evidence, or that she was on notice of it. In these circumstances, if the issue whether the plaintiff stopped and looked between lanes two and three were alive, the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was not complied with. Two courses were validly open to the trial judge.  
      
       
     34 One course was to say that counsel for the plaintiff must be taken to have accepted the independent witness’s version and would not be permitted to address in a fashion which asked the court not to accept it: Reid v Kerr (1974) 9 SASR 367 at 375; Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 236. In the latter case Mahoney JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, in a civil case, a witness is not cross-examined, it may normally be assumed that the evidence of that witness is not in contest. Therefore … in such a case a party who has not cross-examined a witness will not normally be entitled to submit in address that the witness’s evidence should not be accepted.  
         
        
        
         
         But the circumstances of the particular case may negative such an assumption. Whether it is right to make such an assumption will depend upon, for example, whether counsel has at the time, given an adequate reason for not cross-examining the witness or otherwise made it clear that it is not a proper case in which to make that assumption … . It may be that the witness’s evidence is fanciful or such as not to warrant cross-examination … or that cross-examination is foregone for other adequate reasons, for example, delicacy … . 
         
        
        
         
         Similarly, failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested … . The nature of the defendant’s case and the particulars given, and otherwise the conduct of it, may make it sufficiently clear that such an assumption is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice concerning the matter.” 
         
        
        
       None of these circumstances apply here to negative an assumption flowing from the cross-examination of the independent witness that her evidence in chief was not in contest. No reason has been given for the absence of cross-examination. No reason has been given for concluding that the case was not a proper one to make that assumption. The independent witness may have been wrong, but her evidence was not fanciful and was not otherwise of a kind not warranting cross-examination. It cannot be said that there was any other adequate reason for not cross-examining such as delicacy. 
        
       
     35 The other course open to the trial judge was to accept the independent witness’s evidence. He was not obliged to do this, particularly since the plaintiff contradicted it, but it would not have been unreasonable to do so. In Poricanin v Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 419 at 426 Hope and Glass JJA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A tribunal of fact may, and indeed generally should, have regard, in deciding what its findings of fact should be, to the failure of a party to cross-examine his adversary upon evidence which the adversary has given to satisfy the onus which lies upon him. As  
         Browne v Dunn 
          shows, it may be wrong in many cases for a party to suggest that the other party’s evidence should not be accepted, if there has been no relevant cross-examination; and, if a tribunal of fact rejects that evidence in those circumstances, the result may be a wrong finding of fact, or, to use other language, an unreasonable … or even a perverse finding of fact.” 
         
        
       
     36 Whichever course the trial judge should have adopted, the independent witness’s version of events would have remained in possession of the field. The trial judge appears to have assumed its correctness in the passages which were central to his conclusions on liability.  
      
       
     37 In these circumstances the defendant’s contentions in this Court about the alleged defects in the trial judge’s process of fact-finding need not be resolved. The trial judge operated on the basis that the plaintiff walked quickly, as she and the independent witness said, rather than ran, as the defendant said in his second statement but did not say in his first statement. The trial judge also operated on the basis, at least in the passages central to his findings on liability, that the plaintiff did not stop at the intersection of the second and third lanes. Counsel for the plaintiff appeared content to have the trial conducted on that basis.  
      
       
        
       Did the car in the second lane obscure the plaintiff from the defendant? 
        
       
     38 On the appeal it was common ground that the plaintiff and the independent witness were correct in saying that the car in lane two passed before the plaintiff crossed the road. That is, she walked behind it and not in front of it. But counsel for the defendant contended several times that the defendant’s opportunities of seeing the plaintiff as she moved across the second lane towards the third lane were diminished because she did so immediately after the car in the second lane passed, as the independent witness said, so that it “could have obscured” the defendant’s vision of the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendant made the point another way by saying that the plaintiff was “partially obscured by a vehicle in the second lane”. Neither the independent witness nor the plaintiff gave direct evidence about this, and probably they could not have done so admissibly. The best evidence on the point would have been the sworn evidence of the defendant, but he gave none because of his death just before the trial. However, in his first statement he did not offer as an excuse or explanation for the accident the proposition that he only saw the plaintiff at the last moment because his vision had been masked by the passage of the car in the second lane. He gave no excuse or explanation. Counsel for the defendant submitted, and it is not an unreasonable submission, that in the difficult circumstances after the accident, with a police officer attempting to get the basic facts quickly while no doubt concerned with other aspects of the aftermath and probably other duties, no inference should be drawn from any incompleteness in the statement. In the second and much longer statement, made about six months later on audio tape in the course of a twenty minute interview, however, the defendant twice said that the plaintiff came across in front of the car in the second lane, which was a car length ahead of the plaintiff’s car. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q33. How far away were you from the pedestrian when your first saw her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. About a car length. 
         
        
        
         
         Q34. What was she doing at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Running across the road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q35. Which direction was she running? 
         
        
        
         
         A. North. 
         
        
        
         
         Q36. I take it from that she was coming from your side of the road? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q37. What happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well there was a car in the centre lane just in front of me, I was a car length behind that car and I noticed he’d hit the brakes and as soon as he hit the brakes I saw this person come from in front of me when I was, I suppose I would have had about one and a half car lengths to stop. That’s about where I collided with this person coming across the road, I didn’t see her until such time she was almost coming out from in front of the car. It was next to me like just in front of me in the centre lane. 
         
        
        
         
         Q38. What about traffic in the kerbside lane? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t recall what was in the kerbside lane, could have been parked cars or something, I don’t know, I just don’t recall what was there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q39. Were you able to take any evasive action when you saw the girl? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well all I could do, it happened that quick, I hit the brakes straight away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q40. What speed would you say you were still doing at the time of the actual collision? 
         
        
        
         
         A. 15 to 20 I suppose, it’s just a guess, as I say it happened that quick I didn’t have time to think. 
         
        
        
         
         Q41. Did your vehicle stop in a straight line? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q42. How far after the impact would it have been that you stopped? 
         
        
        
         
         A. After the impact oh practically straight away, almost straight away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q43. Would you describe the pedestrian, including the colour of her clothing? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I can’t recall the colour of the clothing, I think she was … what appeared to you know in the darkness she appeared to be a redhead and … 
         
        
        
         
         Q44. How old would you say she was? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’d say somewhere in the vicinity of thirty. 
         
        
        
         
         Q45. Just to go back through what you’ve told me, you were driving in the median strip lane, she ran from in front of a car in the centre lane into the path of your car? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       He also said repeatedly that the plaintiff ran across the road.  
        
       
     39 With all respect to the defendant, his second statement offers a double explanation of the accident which exculpated him and inculpated the plaintiff in two respects which counsel for the defendant will not now support: that the plaintiff was running rather than walking quickly, and that she ran in front of the car in the second lane. Counsel for the defendant, because of his placing of the independent witness on an irrefragable peak of reliability, has accordingly abandoned what would be the best excuse for the defendant and falls back on a more questionable excuse never in fact advanced by the defendant, having no other specific evidentiary support, and having very little evidentiary support at all. The defendant did say that he had a “clear view straight in front of me but not to the side because of other traffic”. For reasons to be developed below, it is arguable that he only had to look a little to the left to keep a lookout against dangers from pedestrians. For significant periods of time, what the defendant said about the side view may be correct. It is not clear that it is correct in relation to the particular vehicle in the second lane. Whether the proposition that the “obscuring” of the plaintiff by the vehicle in the second lane prevents a relevant duty arising or prevents it from being breached was advanced to the trial judge is unclear since he does not mention it. In any event, the proposition does not have sufficient evidentiary weight to be accepted.  
      
       
        
       The arguments of counsel for the defendant on the standard of care 
        
       
     40 The arguments of counsel for the defendant on the standard of care which the judge imposed attacked the following passage: 
      
       
        
         
         “[The reasonable motorist on Parramatta Road] must drive in anticipation of a pedestrian crossing the road in such a fashion as to require him to adjust his speed downwards if he and the pedestrian were to continue. 
         
        
        
         
         I am satisfied that there was a significant lack of observation by [the defendant] on the evening in question and that had [the defendant] been observant he would have seen the pedestrian significantly before he did and been able to sharply reduce his speed to one that would avoid a collision or minimise the effect of it.” 
         
        
        
       He said that the duty of a driver to anticipate pedestrians only arises if the driver was put on notice that something unusual might happen so that his speed was reduced to the necessary extent. The primary duty of a driver was to concentrate on what was happening to his front, and concentration on what could happen to either side was only called for if some circumstance made it appropriate. The defendant relied on a passage in the Full Court decision of  
       Trompp v Liddle 
        (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 108 at 109 which is binding on this Court. The passage, modified by counsel for the defendant to the present circumstances, was: 
        
        
         
         “A driver is entitled to assume that [pedestrians] will observe the rules of the road. This does not mean that he may drive at any pace he chooses so far as [pedestrians] coming in on his left are concerned, or with complete indifference to the possibility of a [pedestrian] suddenly emerging from the side … as the result of accident, miscalculation, ignorance or carelessness. It means that it is not unreasonable for him to act on the assumption that [pedestrians] are obeying the rules unless there is something which should make him realise that they are not.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel also relied on Davies AJA’s dissenting judgment in this Court which was upheld by the High Court in  
       Derrick v Cheung 
        (2001) 181 ALR 301 at [10], which pointed to the relevance of the question whether there was a “particular perceivable risk”. The relevant notice might come from the fact that there was a pedestrian crossing, from the fact that there were lights (whether or not they favoured motor traffic eg  
       Yu v Yu 
        (1996) 26 MVR 509); from the fact that a vehicle was passing a school or hospital; from the fact that there were children playing near the road; or from the fact that a vehicle was passing a bus stop. The fact that Parramatta Road was busy was not enough. Nor was the trial judge’s reference to Parramatta Road intersecting with Palace Street. That intersection was not a true intersection in the sense of a crossroad; it was only a T-junction out of which cars could turn left. In any event, though the accident happened close by (twenty metres away) it did not happen at that point.  
        
       
     41 Finally, counsel for the defendant argued that the mere possibility that if the defendant had been driving more slowly he would have been able to slow to a stop instead of slowing from 60 kilometres an hour to 15-20 kilometres an hour did not demonstrate negligence: Derrick v Cheung at [13].  
      
       
        
       The argument for liability 
        
       
     42 The argument supporting the conclusion to which the trial judge came would depend on the following steps. 
      
       
     43 The law recognises that “the road is not the exclusive preserve of the motorist. The pedestrian has a right of passage to be exercised, of course, as is that of the motorist, reasonably”: Purcell v Watson (1979) 26 ALR 235 at 237 per Barwick CJ.  
      
       
     44 While a legal regime in which defendants were always entitled to assume that other persons would behave lawfully, and in particular carefully, would not be irrational, that regime does not correspond with the current law. A driver is not entitled to drive “on the assumption that other users of the road, whether drivers or pedestrians, will behave with reasonable care”. That is because: “It is common experience that many do not. A driver is not, of course, bound to anticipate folly in all its forms, but he is not … entitled to put out of consideration the teachings of experience as to the form those follies commonly take”: London Passenger Transport Board v Upson [1949] AC 155 at 173 per Lord Uthwatt. “[A] prudent man will guard against the possible negligence of others when experience shows such negligence to be common”: Grant v Sun Shipping Co Ltd [1948] AC 549 at 567 per Lord du Parcq. “The assumption that other users of the highway will act reasonably and safely is so often falsified that it cannot be said as a general rule that a user of the highway can reasonably act on that assumption”: Purcell v Watson (1979) 26 ALR 235 at 240 per Gibbs CJ.  
      
       
     45 It is a common experience for motorists to see pedestrians moving across roads dangerously, either relying on their fleet-footedness and self-perceived sense of timing, or being oblivious to the dangers of the traffic. Negligence in motorists is not negated by the fact that pedestrians “could avoid the possibility of injury by taking due care … the reasonable man does not assume that others will always take due care; he must recognise that there will be occasions when others are distracted by emergency or some other cause from giving sufficient attention to their own safety”: Webb v State of South Australia (1982) 43 ALR 465 at 467 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.  
      
       
     46 The possibility of a pedestrian darting out into the traffic at the point where this accident occurred was one which a reasonable man ought to have foreseen in consequence of the following factual circumstances.  
      
       
     47 First, as the trial judge said, Parramatta Road is a road on which there are restaurants and small businesses, and the streets adjoining it contain many residential streets. The photographs of the area tendered in evidence, though not tendered for this purpose, incidentally reveal that in the specific locality of the accident there was a hotel and a fast food outlet. 
      
       
     48 Secondly, there was evidence that Parramatta Road runs parallel to a busy suburban railway line, three stations of which were within walking distance of Parramatta Road, namely Stanmore, Petersham and Lewisham. Petersham Station was directly south of the place of the accident and only a short distance away.  
      
       
     49 Thirdly, at 9.10pm a quantity of vehicular and pedestrian traffic could be expected, including people seeking to cross Parramatta Road in order to go to or leave any restaurants, hotels and businesses which were open, or to move from their residences to a station or vice versa. The urgency of the desires which pedestrians might have to cross was affected by the fact that, as the plaintiff and the independent witness said, the traffic came in surges: at times there would be no cars on Parramatta Road, and then groups of cars would arrive as the lights changed at Norton Street, a little to the east of the point of impact. 
      
       
     50 Fourthly, there was no convenient point at which the plaintiff could cross the road nearby – no traffic lights or zebra crossing.  
      
       
     51 Fifthly, the plaintiff attempted to cross the road twenty metres from the T-junction with Palace Street. Though there were not crossroads at that point, it was a location which might encourage a pedestrian to attempt a crossing. It was also a location at which a driver might expect pedestrians to emerge, having come down Palace Street from their residences or those of their friends in that street or in streets feeding into it (as the plaintiff had), or from Petersham Station a short distance away.  
      
       
     52 Sixthly, since Parramatta Road was a busy road at 9.10pm, and since it was six lanes wide, the enterprise of crossing it on foot at a point not near any pedestrian crossing or lights was one which pedestrians would be likely to attempt at some speed; that is, it was likely that they might move quickly and relatively suddenly from the kerb with a view to crossing the road. 
      
       
     53 Seventhly, there is no evidence that the cars parked at the side of the road were anything other than ordinary sedan cars – there was no evidence that there were any trucks or four-wheel drives. The plaintiff called them “cars” and so did the independent witness. The defendant could not remember what was in lane one. There is evidence that the plaintiff was nearly 29 and was 162 centimetres in height. It may be inferred that at least her head was visible to drivers on Parramatta Road looking in her direction even at times when she was, from the point of vision of drivers moving west, behind the cars parked at the side of Parramatta Road.  
      
       
     54 Eighthly, while pedestrians can be very difficult to see at night, particularly if they wear dark clothing and the relevant area is dark or ill lit, that was not the case here. Not only was the plaintiff’s head likely to have been visible above the parked cars, but as she moved out from behind them, her clothing was likely to have made her visible in the reasonable lighting of the location. She was wearing light blue denim jeans, a long pale pink jumper going down to the wrists, and Reebok sandshoes coloured white with stripes.  
      
       
     55 Ninthly, the defendant had lived at Rydalmere since 1952. He had been driving for 52-55 years. He held a heavy vehicle driver’s licence. The direct route from Rydalmere to central Sydney is along Parramatta Road, and the defendant had taken it that day to enable someone to catch a train to Melbourne at Central Railway Station. In his second statement he said that the normal traffic conditions at that time of the day on Parramatta Road were that the traffic was medium. This implied considerable familiarity with conditions on Parramatta Road at all times of the day, and certainly at the time of the day when the accident occurred. It may be inferred that the defendant had driven along Parramatta Road many times in his life.  
      
       
     56 Tenthly, certain difficulties in the defendant’s position emerge from his second statement. The trial judge noted two of them, but there are more.  
      
       
        
       (a) The initial statement said the plaintiff was walking; the latter statement said she was running. 
        
        
       (b) The initial statement said nothing about the defendant’s view being obscured by a second car; the latter statement said his view was obscured by the car in lane two because the plaintiff ran in front of it. 
        
        
       (c) A third difficulty is that in the initial statement the defendant said that when he “was about 20 metres west of the intersection of Palace St, Petersham” the plaintiff walked in front of him. But in the latter statement he said the accident took place fifteen metres “before you reach Palace Street”, ie on the eastern side of it. The police diagram confirmed the latter position to be correct, and the trial judge so found. No doubt this was only a slip, but it bears on the defendant’s reliability.  
        
        
       (d) A fourth difficulty is that the defendant was unable to recall what was in the kerbside lane. This may suggest that he was not keeping a proper lookout to the left ahead of him as he approached Palace Street. That supports the trial judge’s finding that “there was a significant lack of observation” by the defendant. It also supports his finding that had he been “observant he would have seen the pedestrian significantly before he did and been able to sharply reduce his speed … .” 
        
        
       (e) A fifth difficulty is that in the later statement the defendant said that the car in lane two was “just in front of me, I was a car length behind that car;” the plaintiff then ran in front of that car, giving the defendant one and one half car lengths to stop; he saw her when he was one car length away. This picture of the accident favours the defendant’s interests since it portrays him as having no opportunity to avoid the accident. Yet it must be radically wrong, at least in point of detail. One respect in which it is wrong is that it is now common ground that the plaintiff did not run in front of a car in lane two, but behind it. That casts doubt on the proposition that that car braked, a proposition to which the independent witness gave no support. If the defendant was one car length behind that car, he had only one car length in which to stop, not one and one half car lengths. The difficulty is that if he was driving, as he said, at 60 kilometres per hour, he was travelling at 16.7 metres per second. If a car length is assumed to be about four or five metres, he had about one-third of a second in which to stop. He failed to stop, but said that he did reduce his speed from 60 to 15-20 kilometres per hour by the time of the collision, and after the collision stopped almost straight away. It is necessary to allow the period of time within which the defendant perceived the problem, decided what to do, and carried out that which he decided to do. Since he decided to apply the brakes, that period of time would end when the brakes locked. If that time had been one second, he would have travelled 16.7 metres; if it had been two seconds, he would have travelled 33.4 metres. It is commonly thought that the reaction time of a driver varies depending on the driver’s age, the extent to which the driver is under the influence of drugs (including alcohol), the driver’s tiredness, the driver’s health and state of mind, the driver’s experience and skill, and the road and traffic conditions. But even in cases where, unlike the present case, expert evidence is called, it is very difficult to estimate what a particular driver’s reaction time in particular conditions is. If the defendant was travelling at 60 kilometres per hour and reduced his speed by braking to 15-20 kilometres per hour, it is probable that he was not one car length or one and a half car lengths from the plaintiff when he saw her, but well over 34 metres away, assuming a two second reaction time, depending on the efficiency of his brakes, and on the accuracy of his estimate that he had slowed to 15-20 kilometres per hour. A reasonable person in his position, it might be argued, would have driven at a speed which allowed for his probable slow reaction time. That allowance would itself contain a safety margin above the 34 metres which would be travelled at 60 kilometres per hour. With that allowance (including the safety margin) the accident could have been avoided. Another point is that even though any precise calculations based on speeds, distances and braking must depend on assumptions which it is very hard to have confidence about, the defendant was much further from the plaintiff when he first saw her than one or one and a half car lengths. That in turn suggests that the “cone” of observation relevant to the plaintiff was not directed sharply to the side, but almost straight ahead. The plaintiff would have emerged almost in front of the defendant, probably more than 40 metres away. The commencement of her journey from the edge of lane one was not almost at right angles to the defendant, but almost straight ahead of the defendant. The arguments of counsel for the defendant sometimes presented the factual position as requiring the defendant to look almost at right angles to the left, but that is not so.  
        
       
     57 The argument for the plaintiff relied on Sibley v Cais (1967) 118 CLR 424 at 427. The High Court said that their approach in that case was not inconsistent with Trompp v Liddle. The High Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The obligation of each driver of two vehicles approaching an intersection is to take reasonable care. What amounts to ‘reasonable care’ is, of course, a question of fact but to our mind, generally speaking, reasonable care requires each driver as he approaches the intersection to have his vehicle so far in hand that he can bring his vehicle to a halt or otherwise avoid an impact, should he find another vehicle approaching from his right or from his left in such a fashion that, if both vehicles continued, a collision may reasonably be expected.” 
         
        
        
       Applied to pedestrians, that means that reasonable care requires a driver as he approaches an intersection or place where it is reasonably foreseeable that pedestrians may encroach on the road from either side to keep his vehicle so far in hand that he can bring it to a halt or otherwise avoid an impact where it may reasonably be concluded that if this is not done the converging paths of vehicle and pedestrian are such that a collision may be expected. In short, the defendant here could not drive with indifference to the possibility that pedestrians might move quickly out from behind parked cars at the particular location of the accident.  
        
       
     58 Counsel for the defendant protested that this outcome was unrealistic to the point of absurdity on the ground that if it were sound, it would be true at every point of Parramatta Road, which is 24 kilometres long. Three answers could be advanced to the argument. The first is that there is no explicit evidence of the uniformity of Parramatta Road throughout its entire length. The second is that an appeal by counsel to the results of common observation is open to the retort that in fact the character of Parramatta Road between Petersham and Leichhardt is not the same as its character further west, or further east. The third is that even if the character is identical throughout, there is no reason why the duty in question should not exist throughout.  
      
       
     59 Finally, the plaintiff’s argument would stress that the matter of which notice is necessary before drivers are to be found in breach of care need not be actual illegality – only the possibility of it. Many children play on pavements without actually going onto the road: it is the fact that they may which creates a duty. Similarly, it was not necessary for the defendant to see other pedestrians actually attempting to cross the road in a risky fashion.  
      
       
     60 In all the circumstances, it might be argued for the plaintiff, while a primary duty of drivers was to attend to the traffic in front of them, they had other duties at the location of the accident: to be conscious of cars passing them and the past and likely future manoeuvres of those cars; to watch out for traffic coming from the left, though not from the right, at least on those parts of Parramatta Road which, like the relevant part, had a raised median strip preventing traffic coming from the right; and to take reasonable care not to hit pedestrians.  
      
       
        
        
       Conclusion on liability 
        
       
     61 It is tempting but erroneous to compare closely the facts of cases decided in the past with the facts of the case calling for decision. In Tidy v Battman [1934] 1 KB 319 at 322 Lord Wright said: “It is unfortunate that questions which are questions of fact alone should be confused by importing into them as principles of law a course of reasoning which has no doubt properly been applied in deciding other cases on other sets of facts.” In Teubner v Humble (1963) 108 CLR 491 at 503 Windeyer J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “decisions on the facts of one case do not really aid the determination of another case. Observations made by judges in the course of deciding issues of fact ought not to be treated as laying down rules of law. Reports should not be ransacked and sentences apt to the facts of one case extracted from their context and treated as propositions of universal application that a pedestrian is always entitled, or that a motorist is always obliged, to act in some particular way. That would lead to the substitution of a number of rigid and particular criteria for the essential flexible and general concept of negligence.” 
         
        
       
     62 However, the arguments for the plaintiff take insufficient account of the principles applied by the High Court in Derrick v Cheung (2001) 181 ALR 301, as distinct from the precise facts of that case. In that case the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal found a driver negligent when the driver collided with the plaintiff, a small child who had darted out between parked cars. The High Court reversed that finding. In Derrick v Cheung it was reasonably foreseeable, in the sense that it was a possibility, that a small child might be on or near the road. The trial judge found that the location (near shops and houses) and time (9am on Saturday 17 December, shortly before Christmas) “should have alerted [the defendant] to the possibility that a small child such as [the plaintiff] might be on or near the road”.  
      
       
     63 In approving Davies AJA’s dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, the High Court was approving his approach. He said (at [10]): 
      
       
        
         
         “there was no particular perceivable risk which the appellant should have taken into account but did not. She drove with other cars at a modest speed, 45-50 km per hour, keeping an appropriate distance between her vehicle and the vehicle in front and keeping a proper lookout. The appellant’s driving was appropriate in the circumstances. For the appellant to keep up with the general flow of the traffic, when the traffic was travelling at a modest speed, well under the speed limit, and when there was no particular danger observable, was both a reasonable and a proper response to the traffic conditions on the day. For the appellant to have dawdled along Victoria Avenue when no particular danger was apparent would not have been appropriate for it could have caused disruption.” 
           
         
        
       
     64 That approach in part centred on the fact that though the appearance of a child may have been reasonably foreseeable, there was “no particular perceivable risk which the [defendant] should have taken into account but did not”, “no particular danger was observable”, and “no particular danger was apparent”. In this case, too, the movement of pedestrians at some speed across the road was reasonably foreseeable, but the appearance of the plaintiff at a fast walk was not a particular risk or danger which was perceivable, observable or apparent.  
      
       
     65 Another theme in the reasoning of Davies AJA was the fact that the defendant’s driving satisfied conventional criteria for safe driving – a modest speed, a keeping up with the general flow of traffic which was itself at a modest speed, the maintenance of a reasonable distance from the vehicle in front, and the keeping of a proper lookout. The High Court in effect held that a proper lookout was being kept despite the defendant’s concentration on looking straight ahead and on failing to realise that the view to her left was obscured, with consequential effects on her ability to see the plaintiff in that case emerging through the row of parked cars adjoining the lane which the defendant was driving along.  
      
       
     66 So here, the defendant’s driving was intrinsically careful. He was not exceeding the speed limit; he was moving with the traffic flow; there is no suggestion he was not keeping a proper distance from the car in front; if he did not see the start of the plaintiff’s journey through a failure to look to the left, or a failure to appreciate the extent to which his view might be blocked, he was in no worse a position than the defendant in Derrick v Cheung, and indeed in a better position because of the existence of lane two to his left. He was entitled to drive with his eyes ahead of him until he noticed something to the left which called for greater concentration on the left. There was nothing on the left calling for greater concentration until the sudden emergence of the plaintiff, and that was too late to give the defendant any opportunity to avoid the collision. A finding that the defendant was liable would be to create a form of strict liability, not to recognise a form of liability in negligence.  
      
       
     67 The trial judge’s conclusion of liability in this case rested on the proposition that the defendant was obliged to “drive in anticipation of a pedestrian crossing the road in such a fashion as to require him to adjust his speed downwards if he and the pedestrian were to continue”. That would have called for a very low speed indeed. Indeed, if the defendant was obliged to drive in anticipation of the emergence of pedestrians like the plaintiff at a fast walk, he would also have been obliged to drive in anticipation of pedestrians emerging at a run, which would call for a lower speed still. Speeds of such slowness are incompatible with the reasonable use by motorists of Parramatta Road, which is a substantial highway between the centre of the city of Sydney and the city of Parramatta. 
      
       
     68 It is not the law that a driver complying with the minimum requirements of the law of negligence must drive in such a way as to anticipate everything that a pedestrian might do at all stages of every journey, or to be in a position to reduce speed to levels which will avoid any risk of a collision at all stages of any journey. Yet in the circumstances of the present case the trial judge’s test would entail that duty. 
      
       
     69 The plaintiff bore the burden of proving negligence on the part of the defendant. This meant that in substance the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the defendant failed to keep a proper lookout and of proving that if he had kept a proper lookout, he would have seen the plaintiff in sufficient time to avoid the collision. These burdens could not be discharged by the mere fact of the collision. To the extent that the nature of the locality at the time of the accident called on the defendant for an explanation as a practical matter, an acceptable explanation consistent with keeping a proper lookout, for the defendant seeing the plaintiff only at the last moment may be inferred from the circumstances. The circumstances supporting that inference include the absence of anything in particular to put the defendant on notice of the need to guard against pedestrians suddenly crossing the road, the nature of Parramatta Road as a busy main road calling for close attention to the behaviour of vehicles in front, and the character and speed of the defendant’s driving, in relation to other vehicles, as appropriate to the traffic conditions.  
      
       
     70 Accordingly the trial judge imposed too high a standard of care on the defendant, and the appeal succeeds on that point.  
      
       
        
       Contributory negligence 
        
       
     71 In view of the conclusion just reached about liability it is unnecessary to deal with the trial judge’s reasoning on contributory negligence.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     72 The following orders are proposed: 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       2. The trial judge’s orders are set aside, and in lieu thereof there is a verdict for the defendant.  
        
        
       3. The respondent is to pay the appellant’s costs of the trial and of the appeal. 
        
        
       4. The respondent is to have a certificate under the  
       Suitors Fund Act 
        1951 if qualified. 
        
       
     73 YOUNG CJ in EQ: I have read the reasons of Heydon JA in draft and agree with them. 
      
       
     74 I should, however, point out that serious procedural irregularities occurred in this case. The defendant died before the trial in the District Court. This meant that orders should have been made under Part 7(10) of the District Court Rules as to the further conduct of the proceedings. 
      
       
     75 I appreciate that, as a practical matter the defendant's insurer was the person affected by the plaintiff's claim. Experience shows that even in this situation, it is usually wise for the procedural rules to be followed.

     Tort – negligence – duty of care – occupier’s liability – duty to provide safe workplace – whether duty fulfilled – whether conduct of plaintiff reasonably foreseeableTort – negligence – duty of care – employer’s liability – knowledge of employer – whether sufficient to raise duty of careThe plaintiff was a shearing overseer employed by the second and third defendants, who were shearing contractors. The first defendant, a pastoral company which owned and managed grazing properties, engaged the second and third defendants to carry out a shearing operation. The second and third defendants asked the plaintiff to attend the first defendant’s property to oversee that operation.In the course of preparations, the first defendant’s “head jackeroo” asked the plaintiff to repair a faulty hydraulic wool press located in the defendant’s shearing shed. The plaintiff required elevation above the press to complete the repairs. Where the press stood, elevation could be achieved by use of a ladder or by standing upon a greasy monkey which was part of the press. Alternatively, elevation could be achieved by moving the press to a nearby platform. A request by the plaintiff to the jackeroo for supply of a suitable ladder was not complied with. The plaintiff was unable to move the press independently and no workmen were supplied to move it. The plaintiff sustained personal injury when he engaged in examination of the machine from the greasy monkey and fell. He sued in negligence alleging that: (1) the first defendant had failed to provide a safe workplace; and (2) the second and third defendants had failed to provide him with equipment necessary for the plaintiff to carry out his work. He succeeded at trial against the first defendant but failed as against the second and third defendants.The first defendant appealed as to liability and quantum. It also argued that the second and third defendants should have been found liable. The plaintiff defended the decision of the trial judge, but in the event that the first defendant’s appeal succeeded the plaintiff cross-appealed, alleging that the second and third defendants should have been found liable. The second and third defendants defended the whole of the trial decision.Held (Heydon JA, Sheller and Beazley JJA agreeing), dismissing the appeal:1. As to the first defendant’s liability:a. It was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would engage in the conduct which led to his injury: [61].b. Different possible courses of action which the plaintiff might have taken were not clearly more effective and likely than what the plaintiff actually did as to make what he did not reasonably foreseeable: [49]-[60]. c. It was reasonably foreseeable that a man with the capacity to work alone without direction which the plaintiff had would have been likely to have become lost in concentration on the difficulties and rhythms of the task without paying an entirely self-interested regard to the dangers involved in one particular aspect of it: [60]-[61].2. As employers, the second and third defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, but their failure to provide the plaintiff with a suitable ladder did not breach that duty. In an ordinary case where it is alleged that an employer breached a duty of care to an employee, the employer is in a position of superior knowledge and power and is in a better position to assess by inspection and other preliminary consideration what risks may affect the employees, and a better position of power to take reasonable precautions against those risks. The head jackeroo’s request to repair the wool press was not expected by the plaintiff or the second and third defendants. The employers did not have knowledge sufficient to raise a duty to supply the plaintiff with a suitable ladder: [81]-[82].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     2 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     3 HEYDON JA:  This is an appeal against orders made by Williams DCJ on 14 November 2001 after a trial which took place on 5-7 November 2001 and after reasons for judgment were delivered on 12 December 2001. 
      
       
     4 On Monday 6 January 1997 the plaintiff, then aged 56, was rung up by Mr Clarke, managing director of National Grazing Services Pty Ltd (the third defendant) and asked to go to a property called Toganmain in order to check that the shearing equipment was operational. It was intended that many thousands of sheep would be shorn in the 21 stand shed on Toganmain commencing on Monday 13 January 1997. National Grazing Services Pty Ltd was the shearing contractor engaged by the proprietor and occupier of Toganmain, Twynam Pastoral Co Pty Ltd (the first defendant), to carry out that shearing operation.  
      
       
     5 On Tuesday 7 January 1997 the plaintiff arrived at Toganmain, having driven from his home at Junee two and a half or three hours away. He there found two jackeroos and Mr McGillivray, the livestock overseer and the person in charge of the jackeroos. Mr McGillivray was an employee of the first defendant. Mr McGillivray told the plaintiff to fix a wool press, known as the MacLodge press, and said that he did not know what was wrong with it. The plaintiff told Mr McGillivray in effect that if he were to fix the wool press, either he would need a ladder or the wool press would have to be rolled over to a landing. Since the wool press weighed about half a ton, and since the floor of the shearing shed was uneven, this operation would require several men, even though the press had wheels. The wool press in question was owned by the first defendant. Mr McGillivray and the jackeroos then departed, leaving the plaintiff alone. 
      
       
     6 After doing some work on the shearing equipment, but not completing it, the plaintiff slept the night at Toganmain. On the morning of Wednesday 8 January 1997, after doing some work on a Sunbeam wool press, the plaintiff began to work on the MacLodge press. He worked for about three hours. The trial judge made the following findings about an accident which then happened. After lunch the plaintiff carried out work on a particular mechanism of the press.  
      
       
        
         
         “The mechanism in question was on the very top of the press and required the plaintiff to be able to bend over the top of the press and exercise some downward force to extract a burred shaft. In order to access the top of the press, he raised the monkey almost to the top and stood on its upward side which was greasy and dirty from oil leaking from the hydraulic ram.  
         
        
        
         
         Whilst striking at the shaft he slipped and fell to the ground.” 
         
        
       
     7 After the accident the plaintiff called out, but unavailingly, since there was no-one within three miles. After some time the plaintiff managed to crawl to his utility. He then drove to Junee in “agony”. He spent Thursday in pain and in bed, but gave directions to his son about the manufacture of a part for the press to replace a defective part. On Friday the son drove to Toganmain with his father, who was in “shocking” pain and “in agony”, and fitted the part pursuant to his father’s instructions. 
      
       
     8 The trial judge found that at the time of the accident both the second defendant and the third defendant were employers of the plaintiff. He found that the plaintiff was asked by a responsible employee of the first defendant, namely Mr McGillivray, to fix the MacLodge press. He found that the work on the press could not be done safely unless a better ladder was provided than a stepladder which was in the shed or unless men were provided to move the press to the platform. It was unrealistic to expect the plaintiff to institute a search for a satisfactory ladder or sufficient men to move the press or to drive to his home in Junee and return with a ladder. The trial judge found that the first defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care and was in breach of it. He found that there had been no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. He also found that it was not established that the plaintiff’s employers had been negligent. He ordered the first defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs; ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of the second and third defendants; and made a Bullock order that the first defendant pay the costs which the plaintiff had been ordered to pay to the second and third defendants. 
      
       
        
       The structure of the appeal 
        
       
     9 The first defendant attacked the trial judge’s findings in favour of the plaintiff and against it on liability, and attacked the trial judge’s calculation of economic loss. The first defendant also contended that the second and third defendants should have been found liable to the plaintiff. 
      
       
     10 The plaintiff defended the trial judge’s findings so far as they supported the trial judge’s verdict in his favour against the first defendant. But the plaintiff also argued, in support of a cross-appeal, that if the first defendant’s appeal on liability succeeded, the trial judge had erred in not finding that the second and third defendants were liable. To this extent the plaintiff joined forces with the first defendant.  
      
       
     11 The second defendant defended the totality of the trial judge’s reasoning, particularly so far as it was favourable to the second defendant’s interests. So did the third defendant.

     12 The core of the trial judge’s reasoning on liability was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff knew what was required for him to be able to safely work on the press if that work was located at the top of the press. He needed either a ladder or for the press to be moved next to the landing. The plaintiff having informed the first defendant of those requirements, it wasn’t for the plaintiff to have to be spending time tracking people down on a 200,000 acre property to see if they would assist him or if a ladder could be located. 
         
        
        
         
         The first defendant, Twynam, is a very substantial client of NGS. Mr Clarke gave evidence that NGS’s margins on the shearing contract were tight so that it was in NGS’s interest to have a smooth operation. It was also in the first defendant’s interests to start the clip on time and have it continue smoothly. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff could have decided not to do anything in regard to the wool press until the shearers arrived on 13 January but that would have meant that the shearing could not have properly started until several days later. The first defendant should have been aware that, if it requested the plaintiff to repair the press and then failed to provide the plaintiff with safe access to that part of the press that needed repair, then the plaintiff would have to use unsafe means of access in order to complete the work with the attendant risk of an incident occurring. 
         
        
        
         
         The first defendant should have realised that if work was required to be done on top of the press, there was no safe way of the plaintiff working at that height unless an appropriate ladder was supplied or the press was moved. That did not occur and there is no evidence to suggest that the process to achieve either was even commenced in the time that the plaintiff was there. I disagree that there is no nexus between that failure and the incident because the obligation on the defendant, the first defendant, was a continuing one until the job was finished. A person cannot just turn their back on a situation and then rely on the passage of time as absolving them from liability. That might be the case if the time involved was substantial but, where a person sets another a task to complete and then makes no further enquiry as to the successful completion of the task within a reasonable time frame, then that would seem to me to be an abrogation of the duty of care, particularly where the worker had asked the other party to carry out certain activities associated with the proposed works. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence that even up to and including Friday 10 January 1997 that any of the first defendant’s personnel sought to ascertain if the wool press had been fixed as requested. A party that institutes an unsafe work environment does not render itself immune to action merely because time passes. If a person is injured within that unsafe environment and because of it, then generally speaking the first party would still remain liable. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         In my view in the circumstances applying here it was unrealistic and impractical to have expected the plaintiff to institute in effect a search for a ladder or for sufficient personnel to move the press just as it was ineffectual for the plaintiff to return to Junee and return with a ladder, a round trip of some five to six hours. 
         
        
        
         
         In any event I note that Mr Clarke who has considerable experience in the industry and with the Toganmain shed was of the view that a ladder would not necessarily solve the problem because of the unevenness of the floor surface it would be required to be placed upon. The plaintiff had in fact assisted with repairs to this wool press some eighteen months before when it was pushed over to the landing and he held a metal piece in place while this was welded by an employee of the first defendant. Clearly on that occasion it was considered necessary and advisable that the press be moved to the landing for that work to be safely carried out. 
         
        
        
         
         In my view the first defendant had a primary liability to the plaintiff. It had a duty of care which it breached and that breach was causative of the plaintiff’s injuring himself.” 
         
        
       
     13 The first defendant did not attack the trial judge’s conclusion that the stepladder in the wool shed was unsuitable for working on top of the MacLodge press; that it was feasible to move the press close to a landing “which would allow easy access to the top of the press from the steady and non-slippery wooden floor of the landing”; and that Mr McGillivray “could easily have responded to the plaintiff’s request for the ladder”. Each of these conclusions was soundly based on the evidence. 
      
       
        
       What did Mr McGillivray say? 
        
       
     14 One issue raised related to the correctness of the trial judge’s finding about the conversation between the plaintiff and Mr McGillivray. The trial judge found that the conversation was along the following lines: 
      
       
        
         
         “Plaintiff: I am here to fix the shed shearing machinery. 
         
        
        
         
         McGillivray: Well, fix the press too. 
         
        
        
         
         Plaintiff: What’s the matter with the press? 
         
        
        
         
         McGillivray: I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Plaintiff: I will need a ladder or you will have to roll it (that is the press) over to the landing like you did last time. I also need a gallon of diesel to clean the shearing equipment. 
         
        
        
         
         McGillivray: Righto.” 
         
        
       
     15 The trial judge delivered judgment on circuit without access to a transcript. The first defendant contended that this caused the trial judge to err in that finding. It was submitted that the trial judge had failed “to recall that essentially the ladder was asked for in relation to something to do with the electric motors that drive the overhead gear for the shearing and not in respect of the press itself”.  
      
       
     16 The evidence of the plaintiff about the conversation in chief was: 
      
       
        
         
         “I said I was there to fix the shearing machinery and he said: ‘Well, fix the press too’ and that was it. I said: Well, I wanted a ladder, I said, because the electric, the belts on the electric motor that drive the overhead gear for the shearing were loose and I wanted the ladder to tighten them and I had needed to fix the wool press. I said either that or roll it over against the landing like you did last time and that was – and I asked for a gallon of diesel to wash the shearing machinery in.” 
         
        
       
     17 The plaintiff was cross-examined about the conversation by counsel for the first defendant. In the first passage of cross-examination on this subject the plaintiff was not cross-examined in such a way as to suggest that the only purpose for which the ladder was sought was to carry out work on the electric motors driving the overhead shearing gear as distinct from the press. The second passage on this subject was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. After the head jackeroo said he didn’t know what was wrong with it, you told him you needed [a] ladder because the belts were loose  
         and  
         you needed to fix the wool press? [emphasis added] 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember what if anything he said after that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I asked him for diesel because you bend the elbow up on the - 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yeah, I am sorry, do you remember what if anything the head jackeroo said after you said that to him about needing a ladder for the – because the belts were loose  
         and 
          you would need the ladder to do the wool press as well? [emphasis added] 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I think he said: ‘Righto’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. And then you said to him: ‘Can I have some diesel’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Have some diesel because you wash the cogs with it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And either that or push the wool press over near the landing.” 
         
        
       
     18 Counsel for the second defendant also cross-examined about the conversation and elicited the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now, the jackeroo told you that a press was broken, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you asked him for a ladder, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What sort of ladder did you have in mind? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just a ladder. I didn’t care what it was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what did you need the ladder for? Why did you think you needed one? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To reach the top of the wool press.” 
         
        
       
     19 Mr McGillivray in his evidence in chief recalled that he had had a discussion with the plaintiff, but he could remember no more about the detail of it than that he asked the plaintiff to fix the press. He did not recall being asked for a ladder or being asked to move the press to a landing. In cross-examination he said he did not deny that he had been asked for a ladder.  
      
       
     20 In these circumstances it was not surprising that the trial judge, who found the plaintiff, despite memory difficulties caused by subsequent heart surgery, to be an “extremely credible” witness, made the finding about the conversation which he did.  
      
       
     21 The first defendant’s submission was that the plaintiff’s evidence in chief on its true construction was that he wanted the ladder in connection with the shearing gear, not the press. The first defendant did concede, however, that “one possible construction” of the plaintiff’s evidence in chief was that he said he wanted the ladder both to tighten the belts driving the overhead shearing gear and to fix the press. In my opinion it is not only a possible construction, but the correct construction. Nothing in the first part of the cross-examination conducted on behalf of the first defendant weakened that construction, and the content of both the second part of that cross-examination, and the cross-examination conducted on behalf of the second defendant, supported it. 
      
       
     22 Accordingly the challenge to the trial judge’s finding about the conversation fails. 
      
       
        
       Would the plaintiff have taken “orders from the jackeroo”? 
        
       
     23 The first defendant contended that it could not be liable in consequence of anything Mr McGillivray said because “the evidence from the plaintiff was that he wouldn’t take orders from the jackeroo anyway so it was completely up to him whether he did carry out that work or not.”  
      
       
     24 The following factual weaknesses exist in relation to this argument. 
      
       
     25 First, though Mr McGillivray was only about 22, the plaintiff did not see Mr McGillivray as a mere jackeroo. He thought “he was the head jackeroo” – “the boss bloke”. He also described earlier dealings between himself and Mr McGillivray in which the latter carried out responsible pastoral activities. 
      
       
     26 Secondly, when the first defendant called Mr McGillivray to give evidence, he said in answer to several leading questions that at the relevant time he was employed as livestock overseer, and that though there was no head jackeroo, insofar as anyone was in charge of the jackaroos it was him.  
      
       
     27 Thirdly, the evidence about the plaintiff’s attitude to orders from jackeroos was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now, you were spoken to by a jackeroo, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you ordinarily take orders from jackeroos on properties? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It all depends what the orders are. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, by that do I take it you make a decision whether you are going to comply with any request from jackeroos?  
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If it suits you, you comply; if it doesn’t suit you, you don’t comply? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, if I think it’s reasonable I might but if I think it’s unreasonable I wouldn’t.” 
         
        
        
       The cross-examination did not establish that the plaintiff did not regard the request from Mr McGillivray as unreasonable. Indeed, his determined attempts to comply with it, and the importance which Mr Clarke saw in his complying with it, indicated that he regarded it as something which it was important to comply with.  
        
        
       The unavailability of twenty men to move the press 
        
       
     28 The first defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s request for the press to be moved to the landing was incapable of being complied with until shearing commenced on Monday 13 January, when twenty-one shearers employed by the second and third defendants would be present. The first defendant based this submission on the proposition that on an earlier occasion it had taken twenty men to move the press. The first defendant only employed seven men. It must thus have been beyond the contemplation of both the plaintiff and the first defendant (through Mr McGillivray) that the press would have been moved before 13 January. 
      
       
     29 This submission rested on the erroneous assumption that on the previous occasion referred to in the conversation between the plaintiff and Mr McGillivray as many as twenty men had been needed. It is true that in describing how the press had been repaired eighteen months earlier, the plaintiff said in chief: “We had a team of shearers, I think there was twenty shearers and we repaired it as quickly as possible. They pushed it over against the landing and I think the station hand welded the top on and I held it. And that was it. Pushed it back and they got into action again.” The trial judge referred to that evidence, but only in support of the finding that the press was “a heavy and cumbersome machine”. In fact only a few of the shearers can have done the pushing, because under cross-examination conducted on behalf of the second defendant, the plaintiff said: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. And can the press be moved around? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, if you’re strong enough, you have got a wheel you pull down and roll it about. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It’s on wheels? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But it requires a few people to push it around? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It takes some – well, it weighs about half a tonne so it takes some pushing about, especially on an uneven pine floor. I can’t – couldn’t shift it.” 
         
        
       
     30 In short, the first defendant did have sufficient employees to move the press in the manner indicated by the plaintiff before 13 January 1997 if it had chosen to make them available. That conclusion is not altered by the fact that after Mr McGillivray and the two jackeroos left on the morning of Tuesday 7 January, the plaintiff saw no employees of the first defendant on that day or the next; and he and his son saw none when they came to complete the repairs to the press on Friday 10 January. The first defendant had simply failed to make the employees available.  
      
       
        
       The adequacy, or perceived adequacy, of the ladder in the shed 
        
       
     31 The first defendant submitted that there was a stepladder in the shearing shed which was over a metre in height. The top of the press was 2.3 metres above the floor. The plaintiff, a man of 180 centimetres in height, could thus stand on the top of the stepladder to get at the top of the press. On being reminded of the finding by the trial judge that the stepladder was unsuitable for doing any work on top of the press, the first defendant indicated that it did not wish to challenge that finding, but merely to contend that there was no reason why Mr McGillivray would believe that the materials to hand were inadequate. “He wasn’t asked to provide a ladder of a certain dimension or the like to do the work on the press”. The first defendant thereafter referred to the stepladder as being “prima facie” adequate, or as a ladder whose inadequacy only became apparent as the plaintiff worked on the press the following day. 
      
       
     32 The problem is, however, that the plaintiff asked for a ladder. Mr McGillivray did not reply “there is a stepladder”. Nor did he ask what sort of ladder was needed. It cannot be said that Mr McGillivray produced a ladder of any kind in response to the plaintiff’s request beyond leaving it to the plaintiff to find the inadequate stepladder. Even if Mr McGillivray may have thought the stepladder would do, it was not a subject which could profitably be explored with him: on being shown a photograph, he remembered it, but could not remember whether it was there in January 1997. Contrary to a submission of the first defendant, Mr McGillivray did not say that the stepladder would be adequate to reach the overhead belt on the shearing machinery (being about the height of the press): he said “[I] couldn’t tell you. I couldn’t be sure.” The first defendant also submitted to this Court that Mr Wragge, the first defendant’s livestock manager, believed the work on the press could have been carried out from the stepladder. That is how his evidence began, but not how it finished. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Mr Wragge, there were certain parts of both the shearing machinery and as well as the wool press that couldn’t be gained access to by the four-step ladder which has been shown to you, that’s correct, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I haven’t actually myself seen but I believe it should have been accessed by that ladder. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You haven’t actually seen it but you believe it? 
         
        
        
         
         A I believe it, I haven’t actually tried it myself. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you haven’t tested it yourself, have you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And I want to suggest to you that the overhead drive which was shown to you a few moments ago by Mr Roberts, that was part of the shearing machinery that any mechanic or anyone working on the machinery couldn’t gain access to by the four-step ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I believe they could. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. They couldn’t? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They could; I believe they could. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You believe they could but you have actually never seen it happen? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I have never seen it happen, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also want to suggest to you that there were certain parts of the MacLodge wool press that anyone working on carrying out repairs to it, couldn’t gain access to it by the use of the four-step ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Again, I must answer that I haven’t seen it myself but I believe it possibly could be. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And, if work had been carried out to the top part of the shaft near the guide and return post, can you say from your experience whether that could be gained access to by the four-step ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Obviously it couldn’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It couldn’t? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Obviously you couldn’t.” 
         
        
        
       In any event that evidence casts no real light on what Mr McGillivray perceived or ought reasonably to have perceived about the adequacy of the stepladder. The plaintiff did not use the stepladder to gain access to the press: rather he simply climbed up the press. The stepladder was plainly unsuitable as a working platform; failing the ladder requested by the plaintiff or the platform requested by the plaintiff, he had nowhere to work but on the oily surface of the “monkey” on top of the press.  
        
        
       Did Mr McGillivray agree to the plaintiff’s request? Did Mr McGillivray have authority to agree to it? 
        
       
     33 The first defendant attempted to characterise the conversation between the plaintiff and Mr McGillivray as a means by which the plaintiff was put on notice of a defect which was entirely within his choice to fix or not; that the plaintiff did not request a ladder; and that Mr McGillivray’s “righto” was not an agreement with that request or a promise to comply with it. 
      
       
     34 This characterisation is wholly unrealistic. 
      
       
     35 If Mr McGillivray, knowing that there was something defective – “a bit dodgy” – about the press, had failed to draw it to the plaintiff’s attention and get it fixed before 13 January 1997, his superiors within the first defendant would have been justifiably annoyed. It would have been very unlikely that a single press could have coped for long with the wool shorn by twenty-one shearers from the start of work on 13 January 1997. It is no doubt for this reason among other reasons that the trial judge said “the plaintiff was asked by a responsible employee of the first defendant to fix the MacLodge press”. If Mr McGillivray had authority to make the request of the plaintiff, he had the authority to assent to the conditions which the plaintiff imposed in relation to his mode of complying with the request. 
      
       
     36 In short, though the conversation was brief, it was likely to be understood at least by the plaintiff as being a serious one. The event must have appeared to him to be, and was in fact, a request by him to which the first defendant through its most senior available employee agreed.  
      
       
        
       Was it reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would begin working on the top of the press on an oily surface? 
        
       
     37 The first defendant submitted that even if all its other arguments against the trial judge’s finding of duty and breach of duty failed, there was one obstacle to the plaintiff’s success: it was not reasonably foreseeable that if a suitable ladder was not produced (no time having been specified) and if the press was not rolled up to the platform, the plaintiff would climb onto an oily and slippery part of the press and begin working on that dangerous surface.  
      
       
     38 First, it was submitted that the plaintiff was a very experienced man. He had carried out the work of preparing sheds for shearing, including work on machinery, for years.  
      
       
     39 Secondly, he knew before he went to Toganmain that the overhead shearing gear needed work and that it could not be done from the ground. He went there without an adequate ladder for that work.  
      
       
     40 Thirdly, on the day of the accident the plaintiff had worked on the press for about three hours; he knew the monkey was greasy; he knew it posed a risk of injury.  
      
       
     41 Fourthly, it was submitted that the plaintiff was not pressed for time. He said he “went out for the week”, and arrived on Tuesday 7 January. Had he not been injured, the work to fix the press would have taken four or five hours. He had done as much work as he was proposing to do on the overhead equipment powering the shearers’ hand pieces; he had finished with the Sunbeam press; a gate he had expected to have to repair had already been repaired; and the MacLodge press was the last job.  
      
       
     42 The plaintiff had open to him several options: he could drive back to his home at Junee two and a half hours away and return with the ladder which he had in his shed; he could drive to Hay or Narrandera three quarters of an hour away and buy a ladder; he could ring the superior officers of his employers and tell them of his problem (having rung Mr Cane, the overseer of the shearing operations just after speaking to Mr McGillivray, and he rang Mr Clarke as he drove himself home after the accident); he could travel five kilometres from the shearing shed to a farm owned by the first defendant which Mr McGillivray believed contained a ladder; or he could wait until enough people arrived to move the press next to the platform, since there was evidence that before Monday 13 January employees of the first defendant would arrive to get the premises ready for occupation by the shearers.  
      
       
     43 The first defendant laid stress on these possibilities as negating the impression which it said the trial judge was apparently under, namely that the plaintiff was in a position of total isolation and inability to contact others. The first defendant submitted that not only did the existence of these options render it not reasonably foreseeable that a delay in providing a ladder or moving the press would cause injury, but they demonstrated either that the true cause of the plaintiff’s injury was his own failure to take one of those options, or that the plaintiff was responsible for a significant degree of contributory negligence. 
      
       
     44 It was common ground between all parties that the trial judge was correct in concluding that it was undesirable for the plaintiff to have commenced work on the oily top of the MacLodge press until it was moved or until a ladder was provided. By some point in the middle of Wednesday 8 January, after the plaintiff had finished all the work except the repair of the MacLodge press, he must have realised that the top of the press would involve risk in view of the oily surface. As he stood in the shearing shed, surrounded by the heat and silence of Toganmain with no other human being of whom he was aware within three miles, he had the following possibilities available to him. Some were raised by the first defendant in address, some others were raised on the evidence, but they all illuminate the problem before him. In evaluating the problem and in evaluating how a reasonable man would have solved it, four matters must be remembered.  
      
       
     45 The first matter to be remembered is that it was imperative that both wool presses be operational by Monday 13 January 1997. The evidence is all one way that that is so. If there were any doubt about it, it is removed by the fact that despite the plaintiff having been in agony from Wednesday afternoon onwards notwithstanding receiving injections from his doctor and taking pills, and despite having been in bed for most of Thursday, he was forced to undergo a five or six hour return trip from Junee to Toganmain on Friday. “That Friday is a complete haze to me. But Mr Clarke insisted that I go and fix it because they had to shear on Monday.”  
      
       
     46 The second matter to be remembered is that the plaintiff’s task in relation to the press was capable of having at least the following phases. It could have had more, but as events fell out it in fact had the following: 
      
       
        
       (a) to carry out sufficient work to reach the conclusion that if the fault were to be located it would be necessary to work on top of the press; 
        
        
       (b) on seeing the oily nature of the surface on the top of the press, to be given, or otherwise to procure a ladder; or to be given assistance in moving the press to the platform;  
        
        
       (c) to use the ladder or the platform to do sufficient work to diagnose the fault and discover that a damaged part had to be replaced;  
        
        
       (d) to find materials with which to repair the defective part and make the replacement for it; as it happened, that was a task which, the trial judge found, involved “the machining of a part which couldn’t be done on site”, and necessarily entailed a journey to Junee to do this;  
        
        
       (e) to return to Toganmain in order to complete the carrying out of the repairs.  
        
       
     47 The third matter to be borne in mind is that the plaintiff was not examined or cross-examined on what his actual thought processes at the time were, and what they were would depend to some degree on inference. The plaintiff was questioned to a slightly greater extent about his opinions of a few of the possibilities open to him with the benefit of hindsight, but even this type of factual explication was quite incomplete. It is apparent that while the parties who were adverse in interest to the plaintiff fought the trial in particular ways, no doubt selected as part of a sound exercise of professional judgment, a somewhat different approach to the case has been taken on appeal. That latter approach is in certain respects not well underpinned by testimony, particularly testimony which it was for the defendants to elicit from the plaintiff if they wanted to rely on it. 
      
       
     48 The fourth matter to be remembered is that when the plaintiff arrived on Tuesday 7 January, his plan was to stay at Toganmain until he completed his work, sleeping there for as many nights as necessary; and then to go to his home at Junee before returning for shearing on Monday 13 January 1997. He in fact slept at Toganmain on Tuesday night. Slight though the attractions of the shearers’ accommodation at Toganmain may have been, they evidently exceeded those of a five or six hour drive from Junee to Toganmain and back each day in mid summer.  
      
       
     49 The first possibility open to the plaintiff was to wait for Mr McGillivray to fulfil one of his promises. This is not an option which even the first defendant suggested should have been followed. There was no evidence that Mr McGillivray ever fulfilled, or attempted to fulfil, either of them. To have waited for Mr McGillivray might have meant waiting until Monday. The plaintiff was briefly questioned by counsel for the second defendant about why he did not undertake this option: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Well, you knew when the jackeroo left after you told him what you needed, your understanding was he was either going to give you a – he was going to give you a ladder, some diesel or come back and push it against the wall. But that was your understanding, wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was my understanding. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was the deal -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. – you had struck when you got to the stage of work – deciding to work on the press, you made the decision to go ahead without those things, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, what was I to do? It’s a million miles from nowhere. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, you had – you could not do the job at all? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And what happens then on Monday when they can’t shear? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You come back on Friday and do it. Isn’t that possible? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I suppose it was possible, but unlikely.” 
         
        
        
       The matter was not taken further. Further, it does seem onerous on the plaintiff to have to drive three hours back to Junee on Wednesday, and make a six hour return journey on Friday, when there was no guarantee that Mr McGillivray would have performed his promise by that day. And there would not have been time to finish the job on Friday in view of the fact that the defect which eventually manifested itself required the fashioning of a new part away from Toganmain and the insertion of it at Toganmain.  
        
       
     50 The second possibility was for the plaintiff to drive back to his home at Junee and return with a ladder. On the day of the accident the plaintiff did not get home until 5pm. If he had decided to get the ladder instead of climbing the press, no doubt he would have left Toganmain earlier and driven faster, but it is unlikely that he would have been able to have returned to Toganmain until just before dark, and it seems it would not have been possible for him to do anything on his return in view of the fact that visibility was a problem in the wool shed outside daylight hours. If he left Junee with the ladder early on Thursday morning, it would have taken him three hours to get back to Toganmain, and a further period of time locating the fault. He would then have had to have returned to Junee to manufacture the part which needed to be replaced – there was no evidence that that operation was possible at Toganmain, and a finding of the trial judge against it. He would not have got back to Junee until midday Thursday at the earliest. It took his son most of a day to manufacture the replacement part under his instructions while he was in bed, and no doubt the plaintiff himself could have done it much faster had he been doing it himself while well, but it still would have made it unlikely that he could have got back to Toganmain on Thursday with sufficient daylight to install the part. That meant a further journey on Friday for that purpose.  
      
       
     51 The first defendant submitted that even if these “scenarios” were not exaggerated, there was still ample time to do the work on Friday or Saturday. The plaintiff, however, was not asked about his attitude to Saturday work. In any event the first defendant submitted that the time involved in these “scenarios” was exaggerated, because, it was said, the plaintiff estimated that the whole job would only have taken four or five hours. But that was only an estimate. In view of the difficulties that emerged when the plaintiff began to work on the press and the lack of evidence that the materials with which to make the new part were available at Toganmain, in my opinion the times set out above are not exaggerated. There was in truth only just time to do the work by Friday. Had the plaintiff turned his mind to the question – and he was not asked whether he did, or what the feasibilities of going to Junee for the ladder were – it could not be said to have been an unreasonable decision on his part to move on with the work on the press in the hope of getting it done without inconvenience. Since Mr McGillivray had not been able to tell the plaintiff what the fault was, the plaintiff began the task in ignorance. It might have turned out to be even more serious than it in fact turned out to be. The proposition that the plaintiff should have commenced by incurring the delay involved in getting a ladder from Junee, which in turn added a five or six hour round trip in summer heat to the burdens of a man in late middle age, is not necessarily a reasonable one. A decision on the plaintiff’s part to seek to avoid the risks of delay and to avoid that experience would have been understandable if the plaintiff had turned his mind to the possibilities. Though there is no direct evidence on the point, no doubt the reason why the plaintiff planned to sleep at Toganmain was to avoid round trip journeys from Junee to Toganmain in mid summer each day.  
      
       
     52 A further possibility was for the plaintiff to go looking for Mr McGillivray. This was raised by the second defendant in cross-examination of the plaintiff: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Why didn’t you go to find the jackeroo to get the ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. There’s about 200,000 acres there. How was I to know where the jackeroo was? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You couldn’t have – could you have not just gone down the road to the house – the worker’s house just a couple of kilometres down the road? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Station hands’ house. 
         
        
        
         
         DOOLEY: Station hand’s house, thank you, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS: All right, I go down there and I get his wife. He’s away at work. She doesn’t know a thing so what do I – I am finished up with nothing again, haven’t I? 
         
        
        
         
         DOOLEY: Q. Well, you could ask whether she had a ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They told me righto, so what was I to do.” 
         
        
        
       This possibility was not one advanced by the first defendant. The prospects of it succeeding do not appear to have been sufficient to have made it unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued it.  
        
       
     53 Another possibility was for the plaintiff to have gone home and waited until Monday before returning to work on the press, or alternatively to have returned to work on it on Sunday. The second defendant put these possibilities to the plaintiff: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Isn’t it possible that you could have arrived there with the shearing on the Monday and carried out the repairs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, it’s not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. For one thing you wouldn’t have time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Are you going to start at bloody 4 o’clock in the morning to repair the wool press in the dark? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It was operative, wasn’t it, the wool press? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, it wasn’t operative. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Didn’t it work except it wouldn’t go back up unless manually operated? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, you have got twenty shearers there, every time they drop three sheep you have a bale of wool. Three sheep each for twenty shearers you get a bale of wool. You would not have time to fix the wool press. You would have to stop the men. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You could go back on the Sunday, couldn’t you, before shearing started? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I suppose I could but do you like to work on Sunday?” 
         
        
        
       By this stage the plaintiff, who, it was noticed by counsel for the first defendant for one, was experiencing pain in the witness box, and who gave evidence over parts of three days, had evidently had enough of barristers. But whether he was irritated or not and whether he was right to be irritated or not, his answers were convincing answers to the criticisms made. 
        
       
     54 Another possibility, suggested by the first defendant, was to drive to Hay or Narrandera and buy a ladder. This Court was told that those towns were three quarters of an hour away. There was no actual evidence that a ladder was available for ready purchase in either place, and the matter was not raised with the plaintiff.  
      
       
     55 Yet another possibility suggested by the first defendant was that the plaintiff should have rung his superiors for their advice. His superiors were based in Dubbo. They were much too far away to be able to provide the plaintiff with any equipment or assistance. This possibility was put by counsel for the second defendant to Mr Clarke, who said that the plaintiff’s employers would have been incapable of providing a ladder because of the distance from Dubbo: “all we could tell him to do was to try and get one somewhere”. This possibility was not put to the plaintiff. 
      
       
     56 Another possibility was that the plaintiff should have telephoned a representative of the first defendant to require performance by Mr McGillivray of his promises. The plaintiff was not asked about this possibility. There was no evidence that he knew the telephone number of any representative of the first defendant and hence there was no evidence that it was within his power to make an appropriate call.  
      
       
     57 Another possibility, one advanced by the first defendant, was that the plaintiff should have driven about five kilometres from the shearing shed to the building where Mr McGillivray believed there was a ladder. It is not clear that the plaintiff knew of the existence of the building five kilometres away, or whether he shared Mr McGillivray’s belief that it contained a ladder. He was not asked about these things. 
      
       
     58 Finally, the first defendant suggested that if the plaintiff had waited sufficient people would have arrived to move the press to the platform, whether they had been brought there by Mr McGillivray or not. It is true that Mr Wragge, livestock manager of the first defendant, gave evidence supportive of the view that in the days before shearing was to begin on Monday 13 January 1997, there might well have been employees of the first defendant near the shearing shed. He gave the following evidence to the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Q. Before the shearing actually starts at Toganmain in particular – like, say, the week leading up to the shearing starting, are there a lot of – are there likely to be a lot of Toganmain employees around the shearing shed area? 
         
        
        
         
         A. We only actually employ seven people ourselves full-time. There was a group of young jackeroos floating around. There is a lot of activity leading up to sharing with sheep movements and things like that. Cleaning up around the shed. Getting ready for shearers to move in and the quarters, making beds, et cetera. Yes, there could have been people floating around at that time, in and out, sort of, during the day possibly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. They were likely to be sort of casual jackeroos more than -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. They were jackeroos employed by the company but they were what we called the mobile squad. They would travel round from property to property doing jobs if we were busy.” 
         
        
       
     59 In re-examination he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. His Honour asked you whether there would be people around the wool shed prior to shearing. And I think you said that people, there would be stock movements and maybe jackeroos in and out as it were? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, that’s right, there could have been. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There could be people making up beds in the shearing quarters? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would that be done a week or five days before shearing started? 
         
        
        
         
         A. A lot depends on our programme. We have other things obviously happening at the time or could be happening at the time with cattle and things like that or whatever.” 
         
        
        
       This evidence is vague as to the quantity of people, vague as to the time when they were likely to be there, and vague as to the possibility of their being there in the period 8-12 January 1997. Mr Wragge couched his evidence in the language of possibility only. Further, though the plaintiff was not asked why he did not implement this possibility, a reasonable answer would have been that he could not have gambled by waiting until the last moment. For example, if he had waited until Friday, there would have been no time to return to Junee to manufacture the new part before the weekend.  
        
       
     60 If all these possibilities had been put to the trial judge, a key question would have been whether it would have been right to treat any of them as being so clearly more effective and likely than what the plaintiff actually did as to make what he did not reasonably foreseeable. The trial judge was obviously of the view that the possibilities of searching for assistance, or driving to Junee or waiting until 13 January were not more effective and likely than what he actually did. In my opinion the other possibilities were not more effective and likely either. The plaintiff was a man whose character and conduct made a deep and favourable impression on the trial judge. He had worked hard all his life. The trial judge said: “The plaintiff is … a very simple, straightforward, honest man of great integrity and an excellent worker who would not like to see his employer or the client let down in any way. He would see it as his duty to complete a requested task if humanly possible without regard to personal inconvenience and perhaps without regard to his own welfare. He was still experiencing the aftermath of his 1995 severe back injury. The plaintiff was well-known to all the defendants.” He attempted to carry out what his employers requested of him in the days after he had suffered his painful injury at great cost to his own comfort. He was a man who had given society much more than it had given him. Even while he was incapacitated from work, he and his wife cared for five foster children at home (three thirteen year olds, a nine year old and an eighteen month old). A man with this stoical and conscientious concern with advancing the interests of others was very likely to move straight onto the task of detecting and repairing whatever the fault was in the press despite Mr McGillivray’s failure to give him the assistance requested. It was reasonably foreseeable that a man with the capacity to work alone without direction which the plaintiff had would have been likely to have become lost in concentration on the difficulties and rhythms of the task without paying an entirely self-interested regard to the dangers involved in one particular aspect of it.  
      
       
     61 In my opinion it was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would engage in the conduct which led to his injury. 
      
       
        
       The Sunbeam press 
        
       
     62 The first defendant also argued that if the plaintiff had injured himself while repairing the Sunbeam press, which Mr McGillivray had not asked him to repair, he would not have recovered against the first defendant, and that position could not be altered in relation to an injury suffered while repairing the MacLodge press merely by reason of the fact that Mr McGillivray had mentioned that it had a problem, though not one whose nature he knew. It is unnecessary to consider what the plaintiff’s rights would have been in relation to the hypothesis of an injury suffered on the Sunbeam press, which was apparently of a quite different kind from the MacLodge press. The only relevant question is what the plaintiff’s rights were in the precise circumstances surrounding his actual injury.  
      
       
        
       The second defendant’s arguments on appeal 
        
       
     63 It was perceived by the second defendant to be indirectly in its interest, while denying that it was liable as one of the employers, to ensure that the trial judge’s conclusions adverse to the first defendant remained without successful challenge. The second defendant advanced arguments which were in some respects different from those advanced by the plaintiff and those accepted by the trial judge. They offer a useful cross-check against those arguments and the arguments set out above.  
      
       
     64 The arguments centred on the notions of proximity, control, knowledge and vulnerability.  
      
       
     65 First, the second defendant contended that there was proximity between the plaintiff and the first defendant. In Sullivan v Moody (2001) 75 ALJR 1570 at [48], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said that no-one had ever succeeded in capturing in a precise formula: 
      
       
        
         
         “a comprehensive test for determining whether there exists, between two parties, a relationship sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of a kind necessary for actionable negligence. The formula is not ‘proximity’. Notwithstanding the centrality of that concept, for more than a century, in this area of discourse, and despite some later decisions in this Court which emphasised that centrality, it gives little practical guidance in determining whether a duty of care exists in cases that are not analogous to cases in which a duty has been established. It expresses the nature of what is in issue, and in that respect gives focus to the inquiry, but as an explanation of a process of reasoning leading to a conclusion its utility is limited.” 
         
        
        
       However, the second defendant here gave focus to the inquiry by pointing to the fact that the first defendant was an owner and occupier of the land, and an owner and controller of the machinery; the plaintiff was a lawful entrant on the land on the first defendant’s business; the plaintiff was expressly requested to remedy a fault, he expressly requested particular assistance in that regard, the first defendant expressly agreed to provide it and the plaintiff endeavoured to remedy the fault.  
        
       
     66 Secondly, the first defendant had control – of the shed, of the press, of a suitable ladder five kilometres away, and of sufficient employees to move the press as requested in a short period of time. 
      
       
     67 Thirdly, the first defendant had knowledge of the fault in the press, knowledge of the need for it to be fixed, knowledge that the plaintiff was going to try to fix it, knowledge that the press was slippery and dangerous, and knowledge of the need either for a ladder or for the press to be moved: and none of this knowledge was merely constructive, it was all actual. 
      
       
     68 Fourthly, the plaintiff was vulnerable to the dangers of the particular task. The first defendant knew about the dangers and knew about the plaintiff’s vulnerability. The plaintiff told the first defendant what he needed. He was alone. He had no authority over the first defendant’s employees and no means of locating or contacting them. His employers could not assist him. He had to perform the task or run the risk of delays to shearing which would be damaging both to the first defendant and to his employers. The first defendant knew, but he did not, that there was a suitable ladder five kilometres away. The first defendant knew, but he did not, how to mobilise sufficient workers to move the press.  
      
       
     69 In selecting “proximity”, “control”, “knowledge” and “vulnerability” as organising ideas, the second defendant was appealing to ideas which in the case of “proximity” have had significance for past High Court justices, and in the case of the other three ideas have significance for some present High Court justices. The analysis offered by the second defendant does suggest that it was not erroneous for the trial judge to find that the first defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care and breached it. 
      
       
        
       Duty of occupier to specialist independent contractor 
        
       
     70 In the course of the argument there was some discussion of the extent to which an occupier like the first defendant could be liable to a specialist independent contractor. Is a householder liable to an electrician who is injured while repairing some wires? This case is to be decided on its own facts. It did not concern a householder. It concerned a shearing overseer sent by a shearing contractor to remedy the shearing equipment in the shed for shearing. When the shearing overseer arrived, the senior employee of the occupier, who ran very large pastoral properties and was about to present very large numbers of sheep for shearing, asked him to fix the press. He told the employee what he needed, and the employee agreed to provide what he said he needed. All these circumstances make the case very remote from the position of householder-contractor.  
      
       
     71 The first defendant’s appeal in relation to liability fails. 
      
       
        
       Causation 
        
       
     72 The first defendant’s argument that the plaintiff failed to establish causation because it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would do what he did is invalid for reasons already given.  
      
       
        
       Contributory negligence 
        
       
     73 The first defendant’s appeal in relation to contributory negligence should be dismissed. There was no lack of regard on the part of the plaintiff for his own safety in some aspects of the work he did on the MacLodge press. The only unsafe aspect of the work he did was to work on the oily monkey. Given his conscientiousness, the time pressures he was under, and his dedication to the interests of his employers and to the first defendant, it was inevitable that he would have started work on the press. Once he began work on the press it was understandable that he became absorbed in the detailed difficulties of attempting to solve the problem. His conduct in deciding to climb up the press and work on the oily roof was momentary inattention of a type that falls outside the doctrine of contributory negligence. 
      
       
        
       The liability of the employers 
        
       
     74 The employers conceded that they owed the plaintiff a duty of care, but denied that they were in breach of it. 
      
       
     75 The plaintiff submitted that the only tools which he had were those he had taken with him, and that the employers had provided no equipment. He had never taken a ladder to a shearing shed, whether Toganmain or any other shed before. Because he had no ladder he had not finished work on the overhead belts driving the shearers’ hand pieces. The first defendant criticised the trial judge for saying that there was a qualitative difference between that work and work on the press, making the stepladder suitable for the former but not the latter. The first defendant submitted that the second and third defendants should have supplied the plaintiff with a ladder to work on the shearing gear. They expected the plaintiff to do any work necessary to get the shearing equipment and the wool presses fully operational before shearing. They were experts at what was necessary to be done if the shed were to be ready for shearing; the first defendant was not. It was in their interest to ensure that the shearing ran smoothly, because delays would cost them money.  
      
       
     76 Attention came to be focused on the state of knowledge of Mr Clarke, managing director of the third defendant, and the plaintiff. Mr Clarke was aware that the overhead shearing gear needed repairs and said he told the plaintiff to check the shearing gear, but he could not recall telling the plaintiff to check the wool presses, though he suspected that the plaintiff would check everything.  
      
       
     77 The plaintiff did not give evidence that he had been told to fix the wool presses. He said it was not normally part of his duties to do so.  
      
       
     78 The trial judge found that Mr Clarke and the employees of the first defendant expected the plaintiff to have the skills necessary to repair both shearing equipment and wool presses. 
      
       
     79 However, the evidence is against the proposition that the employers had notice of the need to repair the wool press and in particular the need for a long ladder. Mr McGillivray’s request to the plaintiff was thus one which was not expected either by the plaintiff or by his employers.  
      
       
     80 The plaintiff was a man of great experience in overseeing and preparing for shearing operations. He had been at Toganmain before. Mr Clarke said that the plaintiff’s abilities were equal or superior to his own in those fields. Though the plaintiff had a lot of experience on machinery, and worked on preparing presses in the past, he did not regularly do so (for example, he had not done so in the previous shearing at that shed in November 1996) and he did not expect to do so on this occasion until requested to. He worked on the Sunbeam press without instructions to do so, but it did not require additional equipment, and his initiative was characteristic of his desire to advance the interests of the employers and the first defendant by fixing whatever deficiencies he noticed.  
      
       
     81 In an ordinary case where it is alleged that an employer breached a duty of care to an employee, the employer is in a position of superior knowledge and power and is in a better position to assess by inspection and other preliminary consideration what risks may affect the employees, and a better position of power to take reasonable precautions against those risks. Here, however, neither the employers nor the plaintiff were aware before he arrived that he would be asked to face the risk of repairing the press. It was not open to the employers to have inspected the shed in advance. The relevant superior, Mr Clarke, was in Dubbo, many hours’ drive away. And if the employers had desired to inspect the shed, the person who would have done so would have been the plaintiff. 
      
       
     82 Since both the plaintiff and the employers were focused on the need to repair the shearing gear, since the plaintiff was the key representative of the employers, and since he had appropriate skills and length of experience to grasp the dimensions of any particular problem he encountered, the employers were not in breach of duty in permitting him to work without sending out any other employee to ensure that conditions were reasonably safe. An inspection by Mr Clarke, even leaving aside his geographical remoteness from the shed, would have been pointless in view of the equal or superior knowledge which the plaintiff possessed. In all the circumstances the plaintiff and the first defendant did not demonstrate that the employers should and could have done more than they did.  
      
       
        
       The first defendant’s attack on quantum of damages 
        
       
     83 The first defendant submitted that in 1995 the plaintiff had suffered a severe back injury which caused him to undergo a laminectomy. He was off work for about seven months. Despite a good initial recovery, his condition began to deteriorate and he suffered bad pain in his back and leg. The first defendant pointed to the fact that on 17 April 1996 Dr Isbister had concluded that the plaintiff was no longer fit for shearing nor fit for any job requiring him to drive long distances. The trial judge allowed the plaintiff full recovery of wage loss for the period between the accident and the trial (less a six month period in which the plaintiff had heart surgery following a myocardial infarction). He allowed full recovery for the future to the age of sixty-five less twenty-five percent for contingencies (as distinct from the conventional fifteen percent). The first defendant submitted that a fifty percent or sixty percent deduction would have been appropriate. The first defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff was now unfit for work, and did not dispute the sincerity of his complaints.  
      
       
     84 The trial judge said that of all the doctors he preferred Dr Nicholls, who had been the plaintiff’s treating doctor since 9 March 1995. The first defendant did not advance any reasons why that preference was erroneous.  
      
       
     85 On 30 January 1996 Dr Nicholls concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The patient has been treated for a major lumbar disc prolapse, the development of the problem being consistent with the history as given. Satisfactory relief of his symptoms were achieved with surgical treatment and to the best of my knowledge the patient has continued with his normal work since September 1995. 
         
        
        
         
         In the longer term the patient is at risk of recurrent attacks of back pain often with minor trauma and it would be unwise for him to attempt to carry out any heavy work or to attempt shearing. However with this proviso I think he would be regarded as fit to continue with his normal work in the long term. It is unlikely that further surgical treatment will be required though there is a definite possibility of some increase in his degree of back pain over a period of years. 
         
        
        
         
         I would assess the percentage loss of back function as a result of this injury at about 20%. There is not significant loss of function in the left leg.” 
         
        
       
     86 On 23 November 1999 Dr Nicholls said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The patient subsequently consulted me on 29 April, 1996 because of some progressive deterioration in the degree of back pain and particularly in his left leg pain but at that stage he was still carrying out light work, wool-classing and doing maintenance on shearing shed equipment. It was considered that his ongoing symptoms were those of degenerative spinal disease and nerve root fibrosis. 
         
        
        
         
         The patient subsequently was referred to me again on 28 January 1997. He told me that the leg pain in particular had become more troublesome during 1996 but that earlier that month (probably on 8 January 1997) he sustained a significant aggravation of both the back and leg pain when he slipped from a wool press he was servicing.” 
         
        
        
       He concluded that the January 1997 accident had occasioned “a significant aggravation” and that the plaintiff was permanently unfit for work.  
        
       
     87 On 10 April 2001 Dr Nicholls repeated his opinions, save for saying that the plaintiff had achieved a good result from his heart surgery.  
      
       
     88 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having regard to the specialist opinions referred to above and the plaintiff’s evidence, I am satisfied that the incident of 8 January 1997 caused a substantial increase in the plaintiff’s symptomatology. I am satisfied that that symptomatology has continued to the present day and the plaintiff appeared to me to be in obvious and significant pain during the course of his evidence. That situation is unlikely to improve and more likely to deteriorate further although it has remained substantially the same for the last twelve months or so. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff’s heart condition has provided a complicating factor. He says that, apart from certain memory loss as a result of his bypass operation, his heart situation has returned to normal and he feels that his heart condition would not prevent him returning to work. There is no evidence from his heart specialist and only passing comment is made as to the situation by Dr Nichols and Dr Perrott. The plaintiff was incapacitated for six months as a result of his heart condition and operation. 
         
        
        
         
         I am also satisfied that, although the plaintiff had some continuing symptoms as a result of the 1995 incident, they were of a lesser degree than those he now experiences and were not preventing him from returning to work. 
         
        
        
         
         Physically he was not as incapacitated for any form of work although I am satisfied that he avoided certain activities such as penning sheep and extensive bending over tables which were productive of back pain. I feel that Dr Nield accurately described his complaints certainly as at May 1996 and I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that his left leg symptoms of numbness et cetera pre-January 1997 were a nuisance rather than incapacitating. 
         
        
        
         
         It is also apparent that he did continue to experience low level back pain. Whilst the plaintiff’s condition pre-1997 may have deteriorated to some degree and may have resulted in restrictions on heavy activities, having regard to Dr Nichols and White I see no reason why the plaintiff, having regard to his qualifications and experience would not have been able to keep working generally within his existing environment at least until he reached the age of 65. 
         
        
        
         
         In my view the plaintiff is now, having regard to the preponderance of medical opinion, unfit for work because of his back injury. That unfitness relates solely to the injury sustained by the plaintiff on 8 January 1997. The plaintiff, however, also now has a heart condition which kept him out of the potential work force for six months at least. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence before me to suggest that his bypass surgery or its consequences would have restricted his working activities any more than his back did. Clearly the fact of this illness occurring is a factor to be considered for the future but I have nothing before me that would justifiably allow me to consider his heart condition as incapacitating and it’s not appropriate for me to operate on the basis of what I might speculate the situation to be.” 
         
        
       
     89 It is not clear that the first defendant argued that the plaintiff’s heart trouble should have been given more weight than it correctly was given in relation to pre trial economic loss. The risk of a man in late middle age having heart trouble is a risk which the conventional fifteen percent figure for vicissitudes is intended to allow for. 
      
       
     90 There is no doubt that after the 1995 accident the plaintiff ceased to be able to shear. But there was a range of work which he had been doing and which the evidence in this case shows to have been available for him, a capable and long-serving employee of a trusting employer. Moving from the most stressful work to the least stressful, there was shearing, penning sheep, wool classing, and “organising shearing teams” and other shed activities. Before the 1997 accident, Dr Nicholls thought that shearing should not be attempted; in any event the plaintiff had not been personally engaged in shearing for some time. Dr Nicholls also thought “heavy work” should not be attempted, but that otherwise the plaintiff was fit “to continue with his normal work in the long term”. The plaintiff was by that stage not doing much penning work. He worked only as a wool classer and as a overseer, running the teams – “that meant you had to gather up the men for a start. You were responsible for the whole operation of the shearers”. This organising work did not necessarily call for heavy physical work. The plaintiff under cross-examination by the second defendant described his position just before the January 1997 accident thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You see what I am suggesting to you is that you had quite significant back and left leg problems before this accident in January of ’97? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They weren’t significant enough to stop me working. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No, but they were fairly close to stopping you working, I suggest to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I think your suggestion’s wrong. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What I am suggesting is they have taken you from a position of just being able to manage your work to not being able to manage your work? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I could still manage me work all right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was still working very hard actually then.” 
         
        
       
     91 In all the circumstances it has not been shown that the trial judge erred in failing to allow a greater figure for vicissitudes than twenty-five percent. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     92 The consequence of the above reasoning is that the appeal should be dismissed. The first respondent (plaintiff) filed a cross-appeal: it was defensive in the sense that it only operated if the appeal were allowed, and its goal was to obtain judgment against the employers in substitution for the judgment against the first defendant. No time was taken up additional to that taken up by the appellant in its unsuccessful arguments that the employers should have been held liable. It is not appropriate to make any costs order adverse to the plaintiff in relation to it.  
      
       
     93 The following orders are proposed: 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The appellant is to pay the costs of the respondents (including the costs of the cross-appellant’s cross-appeal).

      REGINA v DAVID JOHN LANGTON 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HOWIE J: On 10 September 2001 the applicant was arraigned before Acting Judge Stewart on an indictment containing six counts as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: On 22 July 1990 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did use unlawful violence towards another by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety. 
          
          
         Count 2: On 22 July 1990 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did assault Cory Brown. 
          
          
         Count 3: On 22 July 1990 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did assault Jason Stockman. 
          
          
         Count 4: On 22 July 1990 at Kings Cross in the State of New South Wales did assault Gregory Mate. 
          
          
         Count 5: On 8 February 1991 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales in judicial proceedings against Cory Robert Brown at the Downing Centre Local Court did make a false statement on oath concerning a matter material to the proceedings knowing the statement to be false, namely a statement to the effect that it was incorrect that, as prisoners were removed from the van, they were assaulted by various police using batons. 
          
          
         Count 6: On 8 September 1993 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales in judicial proceedings concerning Cory Robert Brown in the District Court of New South Wales did make a false statement on oath concerning a matter material to the proceedings knowing the statement to be false, namely a statement to the effect that it was incorrect that, as each person emerged from the truck, those persons were hit on a number of occasions by police with batons, and also punched. 
         
        
        
       The applicant pleaded guilty to each of those charges. 
        
       
     2 The maximum penalties prescribed by the legislature for each of the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: affray contrary to s. 93C of the Crimes Act - 5 years imprisonment. 
          
          
         Counts 2 - 4: assault contrary to 
           
         s. 61 of the Crimes Act -2 years imprisonment. 
          
          
         Counts 5 – 6: perjury contrary to 
           
         s. 327 of the Crimes Act - 10 years imprisonment. 
         
        
       
     3 On 12 November 2001 his Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 5 (perjury): imprisonment for two years commencing on 12 November 2001 with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 12 November 2001 and expiring on 11 May 2003. 
          
          
         Count 6 (perjury): imprisonment for two years commencing on 12 May 2003 with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 12 May 2003 and expiring on 11 November 2004. 
          
          
         Count 1 (affray): imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 12 November 2001 and expiring on 11 November 2003. 
          
          
         Counts 2-4 (assault): on each count imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing 12 November 2001 and expiring 11 November 2002. 
          
         
        
       
     4 The applicant contends that the sentences are excessive and relies upon a number of specific grounds to support the application for leave to appeal. They are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Ground 1: the sentence failed to adequately take into account matters in relation to the objective seriousness of the offences. 
          
          
         Ground 2: the sentence failed to adequately reflect the period of delay. 
          
          
         Ground 3: the sentence failed to adequately reflect the applicant's rehabilitation. 
          
          
         Ground 4: the sentence failed to adequately reflect the mental state of the applicant at the relevant times. 
          
          
         Ground 5: special circumstances existed which ought to have resulted in a significant adjustment of the non-parole period. 
          
          
         Ground 6: considerations of parity with the sentences imposed upon co-offenders Christine Fish and John Swan require an adjustment downwards of the overall sentence and non-parole periods. 
          
          
         Ground 7: the accumulation of sentences resulted in the overall sentence and non-parole period being unduly lengthy. 
          
          
         Ground 8: no weight, or insufficient weight was given to the fact that the sentences would need to be served in an environment of protection. 
         
        
       
     5 At the sentencing proceedings on 2 November 2001 the Crown tendered by consent a statement of agreed facts and a number of statements of witnesses from the brief of evidence. It is unnecessary for the resolution of the present application to set out in full the eight pages of the statement of agreed facts tendered before the sentencing judge. The facts of the matters can be dealt with shortly. The first four counts in the indictment arose from a number of connected incidents that occurred in the early hours of 22 July 1990. As a result of a brawl between a number of young men, on the one hand, and a group of off-duty police officers, of which the applicant was one, on the other, the three victims of the assault offences and six other persons were arrested and conveyed in police vehicles to Kings Cross police station. The group of police officers involved in the brawl and other police who witnessed it also made their way to the police station. When they arrived, they obtained police-issued batons from one of the senior officers present, Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken. 
      
       
     6 When the young men, who had been arrested, reached the police station, they were each required to leave the police truck and walk through two lines of police who struck at them with the batons. The applicant was one of the police involved in this activity and it was the subject of the first count in the indictment. One of the young men subjected to this beating was Corey Brown. He was struck a number of times to various parts of his body. He was also kicked when he lay on the ground trying to protect himself. The sentencing judge remarked that Brown and others were injured quite severely as a result of the attacks upon them. Photographs showing welts to his body were tendered. 
      
       
     7 Brown was later removed from a cell where he had been detained and taken to an interview room. He was pushed into a chair by the applicant and punched by him to the mouth with a closed fist. The applicant and other police then punched him repeatedly. This conduct gave rise to the second count on the indictment. 
      
       
     8 Another of the young men arrested was Jason Stockman. After he had been made to run the gauntlet of police officers, he too was taken to an interview room at the police station. There the applicant and other police punched Mr Stockman in the face a number of times. This conduct gave rise to the third count on the indictment. 
      
       
     9 Some time later in the evening seven of the arrested men were returned to a police truck for transport to the Sydney Police Centre where they were to be charged. While taking one of the detainees, Gregory Mate, to the truck, the applicant struck him in the stomach and on the back with a baton he was carrying. This conduct gave rise to the fourth count on the indictment. 
      
       
     10 Each of the eight men arrested were later charged with various offences arising from their participation in the brawl in Kings Cross. Mr Stockton and Mr Brown were charged with the most serious offences including Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm upon two of the off-duty police officers. They all pleaded guilty in the Local Court except for Brown. Charges against him were defended and heard by a magistrate on 7 and 8 February 1991. 
      
       
     11 On 8 February the applicant gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. During the course of his cross-examination, the following question and answer occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. I put it to you that as each person emerged from the van they were assaulted by various police using batons? 
          
          
         A. That's incorrect. 
          
         
        
       That answer gave rise to the fifth count on the indictment, being the first charge of perjury. 
        
       
     12 Brown was convicted by the magistrate of a number of charges and appealed against his convictions to the District Court. The appeal was heard on 8 September 1993. Once more the applicant gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution and during his cross-examination the following question and answer took place: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. And I put it to you that as each person emerged from the truck, those persons were hit on a number of occasions by police with batons and also punched? 
          
          
         A. No. 
          
         
        
       That answer gave rise to the sixth count on the indictment being the second charge of perjury. 
        
       
     13 The offences committed by the applicant did not come to light until the events of 22 July 1990 were the subject of an inquiry at the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service when an indemnity was provided to Trevor Haken. He gave evidence before the Commission and admitted that police had assaulted Stockman and Brown. As a result of his evidence, in 1996 the matter was referred to police for investigation and on 20 March 2000 warrants were issued for the arrest of the applicant. He voluntarily surrendered himself to police on 18 April 2000. Evidence was placed before the sentencing judge as to the difficulties and delays in the investigation of the matter before charges were laid. 
      
       
     14 As a result of the investigation of this matter a number of police officers were charged. Two, who were convicted after trial of offences similar to that of the applicant and ultimately sentenced by this Court, were Ms Fish (who was at the time of the offence married to the applicant) and Mr Swan, see R v Fish and Swan [2002] NSWCCA 196. Fish was convicted by a jury of one count of perjury and sentenced after a successful appeal to imprisonment for 20 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. Swan was charged with two counts of perjury and was sentenced on appeal to 22 months with a non-parole period of 14 months. I will return to consider the effect of those sentences on this application shortly. 
      
       
     15 The applicant gave evidence before Acting Judge Stewart. His account of the beating of the young men at the police station was to the effect that it was instigated by senior officers, including Haken, after he returned to the police station. He said that he was angry over the violent conduct of the young men earlier that evening and voluntarily joined in the assaults upon them. He believed that Stockman and Brown were the main instigators of the original brawl. He told the court that he believed that the incident was a result of pressures of work and the fact that he was drinking too much alcohol at the time. However, he described his conduct as “shameful”. He said that he committed perjury “to protect his job”. 
      
       
     16 The applicant was dismissed from the police force in 1992 after a violent attack upon another prisoner. He was charged with assault and placed on a good behaviour bond. The sentencing judge expressly stated that he was not taking that matter into account in determining the sentences he was to impose. That is not a view that I would have taken of the further offending but the applicant has received the advantage of that approach. Otherwise the applicant has no criminal record and might generally be regarded as a worthwhile member of the community since his dismissal from the police service. 
      
       
     17 A psychological report, tendered on behalf of the applicant, indicated that he was not suffering from any psychological or psychiatric disorder nor was he displaying any significant psychopathy. He was suffering some lung disease as a result of smoking and experiences shortness of breath. 
      
       
     18 I can see no error in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. He patently took into account all matters that were relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence. The first four grounds relied upon are to a significant extent merely submissions upon which it is argued that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive. In my view that contention cannot succeed. The offences were all of the most serious nature. The submission was made that there were particular circumstances present to justify a sentence other than full-time custody. With respect that submission is completely unrealistic. 
      
       
     19 The affray must be toward the topmost rung of offences of its type. A number of unarmed young men were savagely and systematically beaten by police officers wielding batons. This was to be punishment inflicted over and above the criminal sanctions that were later to be imposed by courts. I reject the submission that the offences were provoked by the conduct of the young men to such an extent that the criminality was significantly mitigated. This was no spur of the moment retaliation or an isolated loss of temper after which there was immediate contrition. In fact there was no contrition until the applicant faced sentencing by a court. I can see little mitigation arising from the fact that the applicant was suffering from stress at the time and was not coping as a police officer. 
      
       
     20 The perjury offences were also serious, the evidence being given in a criminal prosecution by a police officer, see Regina v Chapman (unreported, NSWCCA, 21 May 1998). Although related to the criminal violence carried out on 22 July 1990, they were separate and distinct criminal acts committed in 1991 and then again in 1993. As was emphasised by this Court in R v Fish and Swan general deterrence was an important factor in sentencing for these offences. They themselves clearly warranted a full-time gaol sentence. 
      
       
     21 The delay in the prosecution was a matter to be taken into account, but much of that delay was caused by the secretive nature of the offences committed by the applicant and to some extent by the fact that the applicant was intending to defend the charges. There was in my view no significant disadvantage suffered by the applicant because of that delay. The trial judge reduced the sentence by 4 months in order to reflect that delay and in my view that was an adequate recognition of the effects of delay upon the applicant. That was, I might add, the view taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the sentencing of Ms Fish and Mr Swan. 
      
       
     22 The fact that the applicant had been rehabilitated meant that the sentence did not have to reflect specific deterrence nor did it have to seek to encourage or assist him in overcoming those matters which underlay the commission of the offences. It did not mean that he should not be appropriately punished for what he did. Denunciation of the conduct of a police officer using gratuitous violence and then lying on oath about it is a primary factor in the determination of the punishment for these offences. In so far as the applicant has relied in this Court upon the decision of R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and statements made by the then Chief Justice, and which have been referred to in later cases, I would indicate that I do not believe that these offences were stale, in the use of that term in the decision of Todd 
      
       
     23 Reliance was placed upon the sentences imposed by this Court on Fish and Swan. It is to be noted that they were sentenced only for offences of perjury and not for any participation in the conduct at the Kings Cross police station. However, this Court determined that the sentence imposed upon Swan was excessive by reason of the fact that the sentences for the two counts of perjury were made cumulative. Bell J who gave the principal judgment of the Court stated: 
      
       
        
         
         180. The offences were separated by a substantial interval of some two and a half years. However, they were linked in that they arose out of the same set of circumstances. I am persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in determining to make the two sentences wholly consecutive. In the result I am persuaded that the overall sentence imposed in respect of the two offences is excessive. 
         
        
       
     24 There is little significance in my view to the outcome of this application in the sentence imposed upon Fish. The non-parole period specified in that case was a reflection of the Court’s view of the fact that she had been a victim of domestic violence by the applicant and her offence had to be seen in that light. While Swan was a more senior officer, that in my view has little relevance in the present case in light of the applicant’s significant involvement in the assaults at the police station. Swan also received significant mitigation by reason of his service in the Vietnam conflict and the effect of that upon his mental health. He was also suffering from heart disease. In my view there can be no legitimate grievance held by the applicant in respect of the sentences imposed upon these offenders, notwithstanding that, unlike those persons, the applicant pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     25 Although the sentence in the present case was erroneous in that his Honour made the sentences imposed for perjury cumulative, in my view he was also in error in making the sentence for the affray concurrent with those sentences. The structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant fails to reflect the seriousness of the offences that occurred at Kings Cross police station. The sentences for perjury could not, in my opinion, comprehend the criminality involved in the offences contained in the first four counts on the indictment. I reject the submission that the offences represented a single course of conduct and would be appropriately dealt with by concurrent sentences. 
      
       
     26 I would maintain the overall sentence of 3½ years but restructure the sentences so that the sentences for the perjury offences would be reduced and made partly cumulative upon the sentence for affray and partly cumulative upon the sentence for affray and partly cumulative as between themselves. 
      
       
     27 As against a head sentence of 3½ years a non-parole period of 3 years is manifestly excessive. His Honour seems to have failed to take into account the result of the cumulation of sentences. There will almost invariably be a finding of special circumstances required when cumulating non-parole periods, otherwise the consequence will be that the normal proportion between head sentence and parole period will be inappropriately reduced. 
      
       
     28 There are no special circumstances in the present case save for the fact that sentences for perjury are to be served cumulatively upon the other sentences. The simple fact that it is the applicant’s first custodial sentence or that he will serve that sentence in protection does not necessarily require a finding that special circumstances exist. It is my view that there is no need for the applicant to have a longer than normal parole period and there is no other matter that would justify a reduction in the non-parole period other than a slight decrease from the statutory proportion by reason of the fact that the applicant was subjected to a delay in the prosecution of this matter. The decrease given to the applicant is a matter by way of some recognition of the effect of that delay upon him. 
      
       
     29 I propose that the following orders be made: 
      
       
        
       1. The application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed in part. 
        
        
       2. The sentence for count 5 is quashed. In lieu the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 12 May 2003. There is to be a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 11 November 2003 the date upon which the applicant is, subject to the next sentence I will impose, to be released to parole. 
        
        
       3. The sentence for count 6 is quashed. In lieu the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 12 November 2003. There is to be a non-parole period of 3 months expiring on 11 February 2004 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. 
        
       
     30 SMART AJ: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     31 HOWIE J: The orders of the Court are as I proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: I will ask Justice Howie to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 HOWIE J: On 15 October 2001 the applicant was called for trial before Judge Coolahan in the District Court at Newcastle. He was arraigned before his Honour on an indictment containing two counts: the first a sexual assault contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, the second a common assault contrary to s 61 of that Act. The applicant pleaded guilty to both counts. The maximum penalty prescribed for the first offence was 14 years imprisonment and for the second 2 years imprisonment. Having accepted the pleas of guilty, his Honour remanded the applicant for sentence on 4 October 2001. 
      
       
     3 On 5 October the sentencing of the applicant proceeded with the Crown tendering an agreed statement of facts, the antecedents of the applicant and a Victim Impact Statement. No evidence was called or presented on behalf of the applicant. The matter was then adjourned to 15 October. On that date the applicant was sentenced as follows: count 1 - imprisonment for 5½ years from 31 March 2000 with a non-parole period of 4 years 1 month and 14 days; count 2 – imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months, that sentence commencing on 31 March 2000 and expiring on 30 September 2000. The sentencing judge directed that the applicant be eligible for release to parole on 13 April 2004. 
      
       
     4 It is necessary to set out briefly the history of the matter before turning to the remarks made by the sentencing judge when imposing those sentences. The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were committed on 10 April 1998. The applicant was arrested on 9 June of that year while he was in custody serving sentences that had earlier been imposed upon him by the Local Court. Those sentences expired on 13 September 1998 and on 29 October the applicant was released to bail on the matters for which he had been arrested in June. 
      
       
     5 On 4 March 1999, following a trial in the District Court, the applicant was convicted of three offences, being kidnapping, sexual assault and common assault. He was sentenced as follows: for the offence of kidnapping, imprisonment for 6½ years with a minimum term of 4½ years; for the sexual assault, a concurrent fixed term of 3 years imprisonment, and for the common assault a concurrent fixed term of 6 months imprisonment. 
      
       
     6 The applicant appealed against these convictions and sentences and on 5 June 2000 this Court allowed the appeal, quashed the convictions and sentences, and ordered a re-trial. On 15 June the applicant was granted bail and was released from custody on 20 June. 
      
       
     7 On 29 November 2000 the applicant failed to appear at his trial in the Newcastle District Court and a bench warrant was issued. The applicant was apprehended on 29 July 2001 and, thereafter, was remanded in custody until sentenced by Judge Coolahan. 
      
       
     8 It is clear that the indictment presented on 17 September was a result of a charge bargain between the Crown and the defence whereby the applicant agreed to plead guilty to the offences for which he was arraigned and the Crown agreed to proceed no further on the charge of kidnapping. There is little doubt that the applicant would have reasonably expected that the outcome of that agreement would have been a reduction in the sentence originally imposed upon him both because he would receive some discount for pleading guilty and because, what appeared to be the most serious offence, was no longer being pressed by the Crown. 
      
       
     9 However, Judge Coolahan determined that, notwithstanding that the applicant was no longer to be sentenced for the offence of kidnapping, the sentence, which had originally been imposed for that offence, was an appropriate sentence for the sexual assault offence. Therefore, his Honour re-imposed that sentence less a discount by reason of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. The nub of the applicant’s complaint in respect of the sentence imposed by Judge Coolahan is that it is manifestly excessive in light of the reduced criminality reflected in the offences for which he was then being sentenced. 
      
       
     10 As I have already indicated, the material available to his Honour for the purposes of determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the applicant was extremely limited. The factual basis upon which that sentence was to be assessed was contained in a “Statement of Agreed Facts” signed by the Crown Prosecutor. The only other material placed before the sentencing court was the applicant’s antecedent history and a Victim Impact Statement. 
      
       
     11 It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining the present application to detail the facts placed before his Honour. They can be summarised briefly as follows. On 9 April 1998 the complainant was working as a sex worker on the side of Maitland Road, Islington. The applicant pulled alongside her in his motor vehicle and inquired as to the price of the various services that she was offering. After he was told that it would cost $80 for half an hour with her, the applicant agreed and invited the complainant to enter into his motor vehicle. The applicant and the complainant then proceeded to a bank where the applicant withdrew $100 from an ATM machine. He gave the complainant $100 and accepted only $10 in change, in order to compensate her for the delay in having to attend at the bank. 
      
       
     12 The two then travelled to a truck stop at Carrington and entered the back seat of the motor vehicle where they engaged in consensual sexual activity for a time. However, a dispute arose as to whether the applicant had received his money’s worth, the result of which was that the applicant forced the complainant to fellate him. However, no charge related to this allegation. The agreed statement of facts contained other allegations made by the complainant that were not reflected in any charge before the court and had limited, if any, relevance to the sentence to be imposed. These included a further act of fellatio and repeated, but unsuccessful, attempts by the applicant to have penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant. 
      
       
     13 The first count on the indictment to which the applicant pleaded guilty involved an allegation that during the course of his assault upon her, he penetrated the complainant’s vagina with his whole hand and forcefully screwed his fingers around in a circular motion. The complainant said “Don’t do that you are really hurting me” and the applicant answered “Shut up bitch”. The statement of facts alleged that further non-consensual sexual activity continued for a further half an hour. During this time the complainant struggled with the applicant and tried to pacify him. The applicant demanded his money be returned and the complainant complied. 
      
       
     14 The second count arose after the complainant told the applicant that she wanted to go to the toilet and the applicant allowed her to leave the motor vehicle. While the applicant was relieving himself, the complainant ran to the front of the motor vehicle and commenced to scream for help. The applicant then tackled her from behind and she fell to the ground. It was alleged that the applicant punched her to the face connecting with the left hand side near her nose and upper lip. The applicant then grabbed the complainant by the hair and dragged her back to the car. 
      
       
     15 After the applicant had forced the complainant back into the vehicle, he threatened to shoot her or slit her throat. At one stage, after having driven the car for about 15 to 20 minutes, he stopped and forced the complainant to walk for about 10 minutes while blindfolded. When the blindfold was removed, the two walked to a service station and a taxi was called. Eventually the complainant was taken by taxi to Hamilton. After they had alighted from the taxi, the applicant returned $20 to the complainant and allowed her to leave. The complainant went to her brother’s home and told him of what had occurred. When the applicant was arrested some weeks later, he denied any knowledge of the offences. 
      
       
     16 The Victim Impact Statement, which was placed before the sentencing judge, indicated that, as a result of the offences committed by the applicant, the complainant was suffering from a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. The report stated that the complainant had been traumatised by the offence and was experiencing significant sleep, mood and appetite disturbances, nightmares and flashbacks. She was also clinically depressed. The report indicated that prognosis for complete recovery was poor but it might be expected that there would be some improvement in her symptoms if she could be made to feel safe. 
      
       
     17 There was little subjective material placed before the sentencing judge in respect of the applicant. The antecedents report indicated that he was born on 23 July 1967. He was therefore aged 35 at the time of sentence. He has a criminal record commencing in 1977 in the Children’s Court when he was admonished and discharged in respect of an offence of malicious injury. Thereafter, he had a number of appearances in the Children’s Court for offences of dishonesty until 1986. In February 1988 he was placed on a good behaviour bond in the Newcastle Local Court for an offence of attempting to steal. From 1989 he had numerous appearances in the Local Court for offences of assault, dishonesty and street offences. In 1992 he was sentenced to a fixed term of 4 months for assault and breaching a domestic violence order. In December 1996 he was before the Belmont Local Court for numerous offences involving dishonesty, driving offences, breaching apprehended violence orders, assault and malicious damage. He was sentenced in all to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment. In October 1997 he was again before the Local Court for driving offences and an offence of common assault in respect of which he was fined. In June 1998 he was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment for offences involving stealing, assault, malicious damage and driving matters. 
      
       
     18 The applicant’s legal representative appearing before Judge Coolahan made submissions from the bar table which included a number of assertions of fact for which there was no evidence in support. For example, the sentencing judge was informed of the following matters: that the applicant had undertaken a number of courses while in custody including a stress and anger management course; his behaviour was due to the effect of alcohol and that the applicant was coming to realise that he had a problem in that regard and wished to rehabilitate himself; that he had a good relationship with his older siblings who were prepared to offer him support upon his eventual release; that the applicant had 5 children aged from 15 years down to 6 years and he had a growing realisation that his criminal activity was depriving those children of assistance by him. 
      
       
     19 In respect of the objective seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant the sentencing judge said in his remarks on sentence:  
      
       
        
         
         “No statements were tendered except for a victim’s impact statement to which I will refer shortly but it is obvious from the above recitation of the facts in this case that the victim must have gone through an horrific experience. She was violently assaulted and manually raped. She was threatened with death on more than one occasion. Like any other member of the community sex workers are entitled to expect from the courts sentences which will deter like-minded sexual predators from committing offences such as those involved here. Like every other person in the community sex workers are not to be regarded as fair game. These offences obviously call for custodial sentences and the first offence calls for a significant full time custodial sentence.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour concluded that the particular sexual assault offence was toward the top of the seriousness of its kind, even though he was not prepared to find that it was premeditated. 
        
       
     20 In respect of the relevance of the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “His pleas may be some recognition of his wrongdoing and I am prepared to take them into account on that basis. They may also be some evidence of remorse but I could not be satisfied, even on the balance of probabilities, that this offender is truly remorseful for what he did or that he has a realisation of the extent of the harm that his actions caused. Nor am I satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there are any prospects for rehabilitation. There is simply no evidence to enable me to come to that conclusion. Further I am not convinced on the balance of probabilities that the time that the offender has already spent in custody has had any salutary effect upon him. However, I do accept Mr Cavanagh’s submission that whilst the offender’s pleas were not entered at the earliest available opportunity, the offender is still entitled to some discount for the utilitarian benefit of them and also to some discount for the fact that the victim has not been put through the ordeal of a further trial.” 
         
        
       
     21 The sentencing judge determined that by reason of the pleas of guilty and the fact that the complainant was spared the necessity to give evidence on another occasion that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 15 per cent. In light of the fact that the applicant did not plead guilty until the day of a second trial, it seems to me that this was a generous finding. 
      
       
     22 The sentencing judge was faced with the situation that he was to impose sentences upon the applicant for two offences for which the applicant had previously been tried, convicted and sentenced but where those convictions and sentences had been quashed on appeal. The normal convention that applies in such a situation is that the sentence to be imposed upon an offender following a retrial after a successful appeal should not ordinarily be greater than that imposed by the original sentencing judge. The policy considerations underlying that convention and the principles operating in respect of it have been recently considered by this court in R v Merritt [2000] NSWCCA 365. It is enough for present purposes to indicate that the applicant would have been entitled to expect that, had he gone to trial for the offences for which he had originally been tried, that is kidnapping, sexual intercourse without consent and assault, and had he been again convicted of those offences, he would have received no more than the sentence imposed initially upon him. There had been no Crown appeal in respect of those sentences and it is difficult to see how the second sentencing judge would have been entitled to increase them. 
      
       
     23 However, the result of the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion is that the applicant, notwithstanding that he was to be sentenced for only two offences, received the same sentence that had been imposed upon him following the first trial less the discount for the pleas of guilty. Yet the offence of kidnapping for which he was originally sentenced carried a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment unless the court was satisfied that the victim was liberated “without having sustained any substantial injury”. In the event of a court being so satisfied the maximum penalty was 14 years. Today we have been presented with the sentencing remarks of his Honour Judge Mitchelmore, the original sentencing judge, and a ruling made by him in relation to the maximum penalty to be applicable on the charge of kidnapping. His Honour determined that in light of the injury suffered by the complainant during the course of the assaults upon her, the maximum penalty was 20 years. 
      
       
     24 In my opinion the applicant’s complaint is made good and the trial judge erred in determining that the sentence for the offences for which the applicant pleaded guilty should be the same as that originally imposed upon him for the kidnapping less the discount for the plea. The applicant was entitled to have taken into account that the maximum penalty for the most serious offence for which he was to be sentenced was 14 years imprisonment and not 20 years imprisonment as would have been the case had he been sentenced for kidnapping. He was also entitled to have taken into account that the complainant was not detained and that there were no physical injuries inflicted upon her. The totality of the criminality involved was less in the offences to which he pleaded guilty and the sentence was required to reflect that fact. Therefore, the sentencing of the applicant miscarried and this Court must redetermine the appropriate sentence. His Honour Judge Mitchelmore imposed a sentence of 3 years fixed term in respect of the sexual intercourse offence. It has been conceded by counsel appearing for the applicant, Mr Hamill, that the sentencing discretion of Judge Mitchelmore miscarried on that occasion as his Honour did not appear to comply with the dictates of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. As a consequence Mr Hamill, quite properly, conceded that it would not be open to this Court to impose the same sentence upon the applicant as had Judge Mitchelmore in respect of the offences to which he pleaded guilty before Judge Coolahan and that the applicant would have had no realistic expectation that those sentences would be re-applied. 
      
       
     25 However, the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were serious and the sentence to be imposed has to be one that will act as a deterrent both to the applicant and others. His Honour’s description of the assault as being a violent and manual rape of the complainant was appropriate. As his Honour rightly recognised, persons such as the complainant are entitled to the protection of the criminal law. They are in a vulnerable position to acts of violence such as that committed by the applicant. Although the kidnapping was an aggravating feature of the applicant’s course of conduct toward the complainant and involved a measure of punishment by reasons of the injuries suffered by the complainant, in light of the actual violence involved in the sexual assault offence, the reduction in the sentence reflected the absence of that aggravating feature inherent in the kidnapping offence cannot be very substantial. 
      
       
     26 Although it was argued that his Honour should have found special circumstances, there is no merit in that submission. The simple fact that the original sentencing judge was persuaded to make that finding on the material before him, does not lead to a conclusion that Judge Coolahan was required to find the same way. I cannot for myself see anything that would justify a reduction in the otherwise appropriate non-parole period. This is even taking into account the material contained in an affidavit placed before the Court as to the self-improvement activities conducted by the applicant while he has been in custody. 
      
       
     27 I propose that the following orders be made. The application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed. The sentence for the first offence on the indictment is to be quashed and in lieu the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months to date from 31 March 2000 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months to expire on 30 June 2003, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
      
       
     28 WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. The order of the court will be as proposed by Justice Howie.

       The applicant appeals against severity of sentence imposed after pleading guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, and one count of supplying a prohibited drug. For the first count he was sentenced to imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of three years, and for the second count he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years, to be served concurrently. The crown case depended upon intercepted telephone calls which showed that the applicant agreed to supply at least 42.5 grams of methylamphetamine and at least 70.4 grams of cannabis leaf. When the police executed a search warrant at the offender’s home, they located 1,314 grams of cannabis leaf and 124.27 grams of methylamphetamine along with scales, re-sealable plastic bags and $1,030 in cash. 
       
      
      
       
       Grounds of Appeal in Relation to Objective Criminality 
       : 
        
       Ground 1 - Whether error in giving undue weight to quantity of drug found at the applicant’s premises: The sentencing judge was mindful of the constraints imposed by  
       The Queen v. De Simoni 
       . Reference to the finding of the drugs and accoutrements was relevant for assessing whether the offences were isolated incidents out of character for the applicant, and whether he had the means of satisfying the orders he took. A sentencing judge may have regard to matters which throw light upon the offence, so long as that is not done in a way which would treat the circumstances of aggravation as constituting a more serious offence which has not been charged. 
       
      
      
       
       The Queen v. De Simoni  
       (1981) 147 CLR 383,

        [2000] NSWCCA 120 cited.  
       
      
      
       
       Ground 2 – Whether error in giving insufficient weight to circumstance that there was no evidence of actual supply: There is no reason why a genuine agreement to supply drugs should be regarded as less serious than a proven act of supply. The tenor of the intercepts shows that the applicant was transacting genuine drug deals.  
       
      
      
       
       R v. Kalpaxis 
        [2001] NSWCCA 119 distinguished.  
       
      
      
       
       Ground 7 – Whether error because no evidence to support the finding that the applicant was at the upper end of the scale of middlemen: The assessment of the applicant’s criminal conduct was properly made by reference to the tenor of the intercepts and the number and nature of the deals that were negotiated.  
       
      
      
       
       Olbrich v. R  
       (1999) 73 ALJR 1550 cited. 
       
      
      
       
       Ground 8 – Whether error in giving insufficient weight to the type of drug involved: The objective seriousness of the applicant’s offences rests upon the systematic and repeated nature of his criminality.  
       
      
      
       
       Grounds of Appeal in Relation to Subjective Criminality 
       : 
        
       Ground 4 – Whether misdirection in relation to the manner in which the applicant’s antecedents were treated: There is nothing in the reasons for sentence which suggest that the sentencing judge imposed a heavier sentence than appropriate to adjust for “leniency in the past”. 
       
      
      
       
       Ground 5 – Whether misdirection as to the manner in which character evidence was used: The appellant had been able to continue a normal working life while using and dealing drugs. The submission that the sentencing judge regarded the good work record and community ties as “adverse to the applicant” and by inference, deserving of additional punishment is not supported by the reasons for sentence.  
       
      
      
       
       Ground 3 – Whether error in failure to find special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: While the applicant had voluntarily ceased taking drugs, that was not sufficient for a finding of special circumstances.  
       
      
      
       
       R v. Simpson 
        [2001] NSWCCA 534 cited. 
       
      
      
       
       Ground 9: Sentence excessive by reference to the Judicial Commission Sentencing Statistics: 
        These statistics have limited value, and none of the cases cited provide a helpful benchmark for sentencing for the present case, or any reason to suppose that the sentences were excessive, particularly bearing in mind that a form 1 offence was taken into account.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by her Honour English DCJ in the District Court at Gosford on 9 May 2002 following the applicant's pleas of guilty to two counts. 
      
       
     2 The first count involved an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely Methylamphetamine, on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which provides for a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. 
      
       
     3 In relation to this offence, taking into account, on a Form 1, an offence of goods in custody, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years to commence from 30 April 2002 with a non-parole period of three years to expire on 29 April 2005. 
      
       
     4 The second count related to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
      
       
     5 For this offence a fixed term of imprisonment for three years was imposed to commence from 30 April 2002, such sentence to be served wholly concurrently with that for the other sentence. 
      
       
     6 Apart from these sentences, in respect of which a discount of 20 percent was expressly given for pleas of guilty, it was established that, by reason of consent orders made in the course of proceedings brought by The Crime Commission of New South Wales, the applicant had agreed to pay to the Crime Commission the sum of $10,000. That circumstance was the subject of one ground of appeal, namely ground 6, which was ultimately not pursued when the matter came on for hearing before us. 
      
       
       FACTS 
       
     7 The Crown case, in respect of each offence, depended upon intercepted telephone calls which showed that between 23 March 2001 and 3 April 2001, the applicant agreed, on six occasions, to supply to callers Methylamphetamine in various quantities totalling at least 42.5 grams. The intercepts showed, additionally, that on six occasions, between 22 March 2001 and 4 April 2001, he agreed to supply cannabis leaf in various amounts, expressed on one occasion as a $50 deal, and otherwise totalling not less than 70.4 grams. 
      
       
     8 On 3 April 2001, following telephone surveillance the police executed a search warrant at the offender's home, as a result of which they located 1,314 grams of cannabis leaf and 124.27 grams of Methylamphetamine along with scales and unused re-sealable plastic bags, the usual indicia of a person involved in an ongoing trade in drugs. Additionally, bank notes in the sum of $1,030 were seized, which became the subject of the matter contained on the Form 1. 
      
       
     9 Although additional charges had been initially preferred, concerning the deemed supply of the cannabis leaf and Methylamphetamine discovered at the applicant's premises, it is evident that, as a result of a charge bargaining process, these charges were not pursued, the applicant thereafter electing to plead guilty to the two counts in the indictment which was ultimately presented to her Honour. 
      
       
        
       Objective Criminality 
        
       
     10 A number of grounds of appeal were advanced in relation to the objective criminality of the applicant, it being submitted that her Honour erred in four respects, which it is convenient to deal with together. Those grounds are as follows:  
      
       
       Ground 1 
       : Error in giving any or undue weight to the quantity of Methylamphetamine and cannabis leaf found at the applicant’s premises on 3 April 2001 thereby infringing the principal in  
       De Simoni v The Queen  
       (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
        
       Ground 2 
       : Error in giving insufficient weight to the circumstance that there was no evidence of actual supply. 
        
       Ground 7 
       : Error in that there was no evidence to support the finding, which her Honour made, to the effect that the applicant was at the “ 
       upper end of the scale of dealers who were middlemen disseminating drugs into the community 
       ”. 
        
       Ground 8 
       : Error in giving no or insufficient weight to the type and quality of the prohibited drugs involved as compared with the substances ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. 
        
       
     11 In my opinion none of these grounds has any merit. It is clear that her Honour did not offend against the principle in De Simoni v The Queen. First, she expressly noted that she was mindful of “the constraints” which that decision imposed. Secondly, reference to the finding of the drugs and drug dealing accoutrements was relevant for the assessment of whether or not the present offences represented discrete episodes which were out of character for the applicant, and also for the assessment of whether or not the applicant had the means of satisfying the orders which he took by mobile phone. 
      
       
     12 The decision of this Court in R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 at paras 15 to 17 does not, in my view, support the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant. It was there made clear that a sentencing judge can have regard to those matters which throw light upon the practice or business of the offender standing for sentence, so long as that is not done in a way which would involve taking into account, as matters of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another more serious offence which has not been charged.  
      
       
     13 There is no reason to suppose that her Honour, in this case, inappropriately took the facts mentioned into account as circumstances of aggravation in the prohibited way mentioned.  
      
       
     14 In so far as the submission also involved the proposition that, since there was sufficient information in the telephone intercepts for an assessment to be made of the applicant's objective criminality, there was no occasion or justification for reference to be made to the other material, that submission in my view is unjustified both in law and in logic.  
      
       
     15 It is not the case that a sentencing judge must confine the consideration of the objective criminality of an offender to the bare minimum of the available facts. Subject to its proper use, a sentencing judge is entitled to have regard to all of the relevant evidence which throws light upon that issue. 
      
       
     16 Ground 2 similarly lacks substance, there being no reason in principle why a genuine agreement to supply drugs should be regarded as any less serious than a proven act of supply. The decision in R v Kalpaxis [2001] NSWCCA 119 provides no support for the applicant, it having been a case where the offender never had any of the drugs in question, let alone any intention of supplying them. He was at the time suffering from a mental illness which led to a substantial departure from reality. 
      
       
     17 In the present case, the tenor of the intercepts point unerringly to the conclusion that this applicant was transacting genuine drug deals, at the times and at the places mentioned in the conversations. 
      
       
     18 In relation to Ground 7, I am quite unable to see any error in her Honour's assessment that the applicant occupied a position at the upper end of the scale of middlemen disseminating drugs into the community. Clearly he was engaged, during the period covered by the intercepts, in the active and continuous supply of Methylamphetamine and cannabis leaf to those users who elected to telephone him.  
      
       
     19 So far as the submission appears to assume that evidence needs to be called to demonstrate the modus operandi employed, or the volume of dealings carried out, by middlemen generally, in order to place an offender's activities at some appropriate level in a scale of offenders, it is lacking in substance. 
      
       
     20 The assessment of the applicant's criminal conduct could be made, and was properly made in the present case, by reference to the tenor of the intercepts, and to the number and nature of the deals which were negotiated. The intercepted calls established that the applicant was involved in systematic drug dealing, that potential purchasers would telephone him in some numbers and frequently, that more than one type of drug was the subject of the negotiated deals, that cheaper rates for larger quantities were offered by the applicant to purchasers, that arrangements were made for meetings at various places to carry out the deals, and that credit was offered more than once. 
      
       
     21 Those circumstances in my view provided ample basis for her Honour's finding in accordance with the principles referred to in Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 1550. 
      
       
     22 Finally, in relation to the nature of the drugs involved, comparison with individual cases of a supply of drugs such as heroin and/or cocaine, provides little by way of guidance. Methylamphetamine remains a prohibited and regrettably popular drug which is easy to obtain and cheap to manufacture. A significant group of offenders, in fact, devote their entrepreneurial activities to its manufacture and sale, and its use by polydrug abusers who also resort to harder drugs, is a dismal fact of life. In any event the objective seriousness of the applicant's offences rests in this case upon the systematic and repeated nature of his criminality. 
      
       
     23 The philosophy behind the creation of the offence of “ongoing supply” reflects that circumstance and it is properly one which calls for condign sentences. Both specific and general deterrence loom large in this case. As her Honour appropriately noted, it is essential for a proper discharge of judicial office that a sentence for an offence of “ongoing supply” is imposed which will make it clear to those who are minded to profit from regular drug dealing, even where they are themselves users, that they risk receiving salutary penalties. 
      
       
     24 Otherwise this evil and selfish trade, which can only survive in the presence of middlemen such as the applicant, will continue, with the associated criminality to which users are forced in order to feed their habits. That circumstance was itself appropriately noted by her Honour so far as it related to events on the Central Coast of this State. 
      
       
        
       Subjective Criminality 
        
       
     25 A number of further grounds were directed to the way in which her Honour dealt with the applicant's subjective circumstances as follows: 
      
       
       Ground 4 
       : Misdirection in relation to the manner in which the applicant's antecedents were treated. 
        
       Ground 5 
       : Misdirection as to the manner in which the character evidence was used. 
        
       Ground 6 
       : Not pursued. 
        
       Ground 3 
       : Failure to find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
       1999.  
        
       
     26 Again these submissions can be dealt with together. In relation to Ground 4, it was submitted that her Honour's observation to the effect that the applicant had been treated ""leniently in the past"" was not open to her. By implication, it was suggested, this meant that she had imposed a heavier sentence than appropriate in order to adjust for that circumstance. 
      
       
     27 There is nothing in the reasons for sentence which would suggest that her Honour fell into the egregious error which that submission would imply. It was the fact that the applicant had a somewhat lengthy and varied criminal history dating back to 1982 which included offences of dishonesty, serious motor vehicle offences including driving in a manner dangerous, driving while disqualified and driving while under the influence (which included two high range PCA offences) as well as antisocial offences of common assault, offensive behaviour, offensive language and malicious destruction of railway property which had variously seen him subjected to bonds, fines, ordered to perform community service, and subjected to a suspended term of imprisonment. 
      
       
     28 While that record did not include any prior drug convictions, it was not a record which did him any credit nor was it one which showed him to be a person of good character. That ground lacks merit. 
      
       
     29 In relation to Ground 5, it was submitted that the evidence which was called, to show that the applicant had been successfully carrying on a private and commercial life while addicted to amphetamines (although that was seemingly quite unobserved by his friends and business associates) was given insufficient weight by her Honour when dealing with the issue of rehabilitation and, in fact, it was suggested, was inappropriately regarded as an adverse circumstance. In this regard her Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The fact that he has a good work record and strong community ties are matters that would normally be taken into account. However, he was busily engaged in dealing in drugs whilst so employed and I therefore cannot find that these matters bode well for his rehabilitation” 
         
        
       
     30 When read in context, it is clear that all that her Honour was saying was, that this was not a case of the kind sometimes seen where a return of an offender to a useful working life can contribute to rehabilitation, in the sense of encouraging the cessation of the offending behaviour. 
      
       
     31 In this case the applicant had apparently been able to continue a normal social life and an effective working life in a position of some responsibility, yet at the same time he had elected to continue his own use of drugs and to conduct an active drug dealing enterprise. 
      
       
     32 The submission that it would seem that her Honour regarded the good work record and community ties as a matter which was “adverse to the applicant”, and by implication deserving of some additional punishment, derives no support from a fair reading of this passage in the reasons for sentence.  
      
       
     33 Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, even making allowance for the applicant's claimed addiction to Methylamphetamine, the fact of his favourable work record and community ties were not themselves demonstrative of the fact of his rehabilitation, or even of his prospects of turning his back on this form of criminality in the future, since it had been his choice to lead a double life, one strand or side of which involved serious ongoing criminality. 
      
       
     34 In relation to Ground 3, it was submitted that her Honour fell into error in relation to the existence of special circumstances, so far as she concluded that the applicant had not been genuine about his rehabilitation since he had ""done nothing about addressing his addiction other than to cease taking any drugs"" since his arrest. 
      
       
     35 As I understand this passage, what her Honour was referring to was the fact that the applicant had not entered into any form of drug rehabilitation program or counselling of the kind that might have addressed the underlying reasons for his resort to drugs, or which might provide him with the means of resisting future temptation. 
      
       
     36 While it was to his credit that he had voluntarily ceased taking drugs, that was not in the circumstances of this case sufficient reason for a finding of special circumstances.  
      
       
     37 The statutory ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period can be departed from where there is good reason to do so in the presence of circumstances of the kind discussed in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534. 
      
       
     38 In the present case the applicant does have gainful employment to which he can return; he is not a young person (being 33 years of age at the time of sentence) who by reason of his youth or immaturity was in serious need of long-term supervision; and he has demonstrated the capacity, if he so chooses, to take himself off drugs.  
      
       
     39 I am not persuaded, in those circumstances, that the potential period of release for one year on parole would be insufficient, in his case, to secure or to assist in his rehabilitation. No other matters which might come within the definition of special circumstances were identified either before her Honour or on appeal. I, accordingly, see no error in her Honour's findings. 
      
       
     40 Finally, it was submitted, via a catch all Ground 9, that the sentence as a whole was excessive by reference to the Judicial Commission Sentencing Statistics and by reference to the decisions of this Court in R v Carter [2000] NSWCCA 490; R v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169; R v Huang and Lin [2002] NSWCCA 76, each of which involved s 25A offences.  
      
       
     41 The Judicial Commission's statistics for all offenders for a s 25A amphetamine offence, show that the sentence on the first count was towards the top of the range. However, as this Court has frequently pointed out, for example in Carter, these statistics have limited value particularly where the statistical population is small, as it is in this instance, since for all offenders there are only 14 cases included in that population. 
      
       
     42 The reason for caution being required in the use of these statistics lies in the fact that very different objective and subjective circumstances are encompassed and, in particular so far as this offence is concerned, in the differences between the number and the extent of the dealings encompassed in the various cases. 
      
       
     43 None of the cases cited, being appeals against severity which were each dismissed, provides any helpful benchmark for sentencing in relation to the present case, let alone any reason to suppose that the sentences which were imposed were excessive. Particularly is that so bearing in mind that the Form 1 offence, which was taken into account in relation to the first count, needed to be reflected by some additional penalty, although not to the same extent as that which might have been applicable had the matter been the subject of a separate charge. See R v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 and R v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 322. 
      
       
     44 In all these circumstances, while I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, I am not persuaded that error has been shown and I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     45 HOWIE J: I agree. 
      
       
     46 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Nield, in the District Court, on 18 January 2002. The sentences were imposed following pleas of guilty, which were accepted as having been offered at the earliest appropriate opportunity, to two counts of break, enter and steal; one count of entering a dwelling with intent to steal; and one count of stealing from a dwelling. 
      
       
     2 In chronological order the short facts were as follows: 
      
       
       Count 4 
        
       
     3 On 16 July 2001, the applicant stole a Cannon camera from a dwelling, namely a room in the Bunkhouse Backpackers Hostel in Byron Bay, which he then attempted to pawn at the Byron Bay Loan Office. For this offence of stealing from a dwelling, he was sentenced to a fixed term of nine months to date from 24 August 2001, that being the date upon which he went into custody. 
      
       
       Count 2 
        
       
     4 On 18 August 2001 between the hours of 1pm and 5pm, the applicant broke into a locked room at the Crossroads Backpackers Hostel at Potts Point, and stole an Olympus camera and lens, which he pawned at the Alpha Loan Office in Kings Cross for $50. For this offence of break, enter and steal he was sentenced to a fixed term of one year and four months to date from 24 October 2001. 
      
       
       Count 3 
        
       
     5 On 18 August 2001 at about 5pm the applicant was observed trying to open a door in the Sydney Central Backpackers Hostel, Kings Cross. Although pursued by residents and later handed over to police, he was released after questioning. For this offence of enter with intent he was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months, to commence on 24 February 2002. 
      
       
        
       Count 1 
        
       
     6 On 23 August 2001, the applicant broke into an apartment at Edgecliff and stole a laptop computer which he then attempted to pawn. For this offence of break, enter and steal he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years commencing on 24 February 2003, and expiring on 23 February 2006, with a non-parole period of one year commencing also on 24 February 2003, and expiring on 23 February 2004.  
      
       
     7 The overall sentence, as a result of the accumulation of the sentences, was accordingly one of imprisonment for four and a half years, with a non-parole period of two and a half years. The sentence for count 4 has now expired.  
      
       
     8 At the time of these offences the applicant was on parole for an offence of take and drive conveyance. By reason of subsequent offences including, but not confined to the offences dealt with by his Honour Judge Nield, that parole was revoked on 12 February 2002, and the applicant was required to serve the balance of parole between 24 August 2001 and 30 November 2001.  
      
       
     9 The applicant submits that error was disclosed in six specific respects, which I will deal with in turn. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        - Failure to take into account the applicant's mental condition as affecting general and personal deterrence. 
       
     10 The presentence report, and a report prepared in May 2000 by a psychiatrist, Doctor Rosalie Wilcox, were tendered in evidence. They showed that, since the age of 19 years, the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from various forms of mental ill-health including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and narcissistic personality disorder. The preferred diagnosis, Doctor Wilcox's report suggested, is that of bipolar disorder. 
      
       
     11 He has had a number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals in New South Wales and other states, as well as in the United Kingdom.  
      
       
     12 The history noted in these reports made specific reference to the fact that he had been treated with psychoactive medication, but had been generally resistant to accepting that he had a mental illness, and was unwilling to take medication for his condition, preferring to treat himself by the use of heroin.  
      
       
     13 On the day after the last of the current offences he was admitted to the Long Bay Prison Hospital and medicated pursuant to a treatment order. By the time he appeared for sentence, however, he was assessed as not requiring medication. 
      
       
     14 The material placed before his Honour did not include any additional expert evidence concerning his current medical status.  
      
       
     15 Doctor Wilcox had diagnosed the applicant in May 2000, at a time when he was due for sentence in relation to other matters, as suffering from bipolar disorder, poly-substance abuse, and antisocial personality traits. She was of the opinion that, unmedicated, his disorder made it probable that he suffered from impaired judgment. Although she noted at the time that the applicant was ""gradually coming to accept that he may have a mental illness that requires treatment"", it is obvious that he had not done anything to address that problem during his period of release on parole, from 15 April 2001 until his arrest on the present charge.  
      
       
     16 Regrettably, that report had not been updated so as to deal more specifically with his mental state at the time of the present offences.  
      
       
     17 When giving evidence, however, the applicant confirmed that he found it difficult to accept that he was mentally ill; expressed concern that the long-term effects of medication were quite horrific; and indicated that, when bailed to go to a psychiatric unit on an earlier occasion, he had absconded from it. He made it clear that he had been using illicit drugs to suppress his moods. He did indicate a willingness to undergo counselling for both the drug issues and the mental health issues, adding that he had not from past experience, however, benefited from medication. 
      
       
     18 When dealing with the applicant's mental health issues in a particularly comprehensive judgment, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
           
          
         ""He has rejected the diagnosis of the doctors who have examined him and he has refused the medication prescribed for him by doctors. Having regard to what happened to him during his giving of evidence, it is clear that he finds difficulty in both understanding and accepting that he has a mental disorder which needs treatment. It is to be hoped that he will accept such treatment as might be available to him in prison.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     19 While accepting that his Honour did not ignore the issue of mental health, it was submitted that his finding was not entirely correct, having regard to the fact that he had taken medication in the past, and having regard additionally to Doctor Wilcox's observation that he was gradually accepting the mental disorder. 
      
       
     20 Additionally it was submitted that his Honour, in not referring to the well recognised principle expressed in decisions such as Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 51 A Crim R 81; Regina v Letteri NSWCCA 18 March 1992; and Regina v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 62, failed to appreciate that the need for personal and general deterrence, which he saw as relevant to the sentencing exercise, should be mitigated by the applicant's mental disorder.  
      
       
     21 Where an offender's ability to make a reasoned or ordered judgment is reduced by the presence of a mental disorder, then it is proper that specific consideration be given to that factor for the reasons explained by me in Regina v Henry [1999] 46 NSWLR 346 at para 254.  
      
       
     22 Moreover, as the decisions earlier cited demonstrate, both personal and general deterrence have less relevance, in the case of an offender who suffers from an on-going condition, since the community will understand both the reason for his behaviour, and the fact that the constraints of a sentence will have less impact upon a person who, through illness, has a compromised ability to moderate his behaviour.  
      
       
     23 However, this has to be balanced against the community interest, in the case of an offender such as the present applicant, who does not accept that he has a condition requiring treatment, particularly if the offender is accustomed to resorting to measures such as the use of illicit drugs to deal with it. The need for a proper balance was expressly recognised by this Court in its judgment in Regina v Engert at pages 68 and 71, and it is also implicit in a decision in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, so far as that decision recognises the community interest in relation to repetitive offenders who are unable to moderate their behaviour or who are unwilling to do so.  
      
       
     24 While it would have been preferable for his Honour to have made express reference to the decisions mentioned, when dealing with the applicant's mental health, and with the relevance of deterrence, his comments otherwise do need to be considered in the context of the particular case. Relevant in that regard was the lengthy criminal history of the applicant, which included some 88 convictions for offences in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania extending over 14 years, mostly involving dishonesty, particularly stealing, but also involving prohibited drugs and an offence of escape. The constraints of imprisonment, release on recognizance, probation and community service, appear to have had little impact upon him and the present offences were a repetition of similar conduct in recent years which had seen him imprisoned.  
      
       
     25 Also relevant was the applicant's assertions to Doctor Wilcox that he did not see himself as requiring any form of rehabilitation; that he did not like taking medication and that he had ceased using it previously when released; as well as his evidence that the principal reason for committing the present offences was the need to feed his drug habit.  
      
       
     26 I am not persuaded, in the circumstances outlined, that his Honour's assessment was inappropriate, or that the interests of deterrence, whether general or specific, were of significantly reduced relevance. On the contrary, balancing the relevant interests, I am unpersuaded of any error in this respect. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        - The sentence does not reflect sentencing judges’ findings, that the break and enter offence fell ""towards the bottom range of seriousness"" and that the other offences were of ""less seriousness"". 
        
       
     27 It is the fact that the offences were of a fairly routine kind; the goods taken being of no great monetary or sentimental value; the property involved being unoccupied at the time so that no person was put in fear; and the actual loss of the victim being insignificant since the property taken was recovered, although subject in one case to a monetary payment by the victim of the amount of the pledge.  
      
       
     28 In this regard it was submitted that while there were present circumstances of aggravation, in that there were four offences committed by an offender on parole, who had a multiplicity of convictions, nevertheless the fact of his mental disorder and drug dependency outweighed these considerations with the consequence that the sentences individually, and in accumulation, were excessive. 
      
       
     29 Some reference was made to the observations in Regina v Henry by Spigelman CJ (at para 174) and by myself (at para 273), concerning the relevance of drug dependency for the assessment of an offender's objective criminality. The observations cited need to be understood in the context of those reasons, which make it plain that, while a drug dependency may explain the commission of an offence, they do not excuse it. In particular, the observations in my judgment were directed to the exceptional case where an extreme state of withdrawal may lead to a frank disorder of the offender's thought processes, or to the act being other than a willing act. There is no evidence to suggest that the present case fell into that category of cases. 
      
       
     30 The choice by the applicant of using heroin for the treatment of his moods, in circumstances where he had rejected the medical alternative, despite being given considerable encouragement to turn to that option, in the form of advice, as well as coercion by reason of his repeated imprisonments, cannot be called in aid by him to reduce his objective criminality.  
      
       
     31 I am not persuaded, having regard to the applicant's bad prior record, and the circumstance that the offences were committed while on parole, that subject to the question of accumulation, the sentences held to be appropriate were excessive. Offences involving the breaking and entering of, and theft from private premises remain serious offences, and the fact that these offences were drug related does not make them any less so.  
      
       
     32 It was submitted additionally, in support of this ground, that when determining appropriate sentences, his Honour had fallen into error in not taking into account the pleas of guilty.  
      
       
     33 It may be accepted, that it was necessary, consistent with the decision in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, for his Honour to have determined an appropriate sentence for each offence, without reference to the other offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced, that is, untainted by reference to them: see Regina v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 and Regina v Myers [2002] NSWCCA 162. 
      
       
     34 As I read his Honour's reasons for judgment at page 9, this is precisely the way in which he approached this case, having earlier indicated, ""I intend to reduce the sentences that I intend to impose upon the applicant by 25 percent on account of his guilty pleas"".  
      
       
     35 Again, having regard to the prior record, the repetitive nature of his offences, and the applicant's state of unwillingness in the past to address his problem, I am not persuaded this ground has been made good. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
        - The learned trial judge erred in failing to take into account that these offences could have been dealt with to finality in the Local Court. 
       
     36 It was submitted that, by failing to advert to this fact, or to the possibility that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court under S 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, his Honour must have overlooked this consideration. However, as I pointed out in Regina v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297, there is no absolute principle of law that a sentencing judge must proceed upon the basis that the maximum sentence available in such a situation (here, imprisonment for three years) should be that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. The facts in Crombie are markedly different from those in the present case, where the applicant had multiple convictions for similar offences; had served several terms of imprisonment and has re-offended while on parole. The simple fact is that the applicant chose to plead not guilty in the Local Court, and the DPP had every right to elect to proceed upon indictment in view of the prior record. 
      
       
     37 The ultimate question remains that referred to otherwise in these reasons for judgment, namely as to whether some other sentence than that imposed was warranted. To that I will return when I come to the question of accumulation. Otherwise I am not persuaded that there is any merit in this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 5  
       - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account that the applicant would serve his sentence in maximum security. 
        
       
     38 It is evident that this fact was placed before his Honour and it may be assumed that as an experienced trial judge, it was not overlooked by him. In a busy sentencing court where there is pressure to proceed to sentence on the day the matter is listed, it can be understood that there may not always be express reference to every single matter which is taken into account or raised in the course of argument.  
      
       
     39 As I have observed, his Honour gave extensive reasons for sentence in this matter, which falls to be reviewed in the light of the criterion set forth in S 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
     40 So far as the immediate submission is concerned, it is the fact that the applicant had a history of escape and as a consequence, he could expect that any further sentence imposed upon him would lead to additional constraints on his progression through the normal classification processes. He cannot expect to escape punishment or to have a full term reduced by reason of that self-inflicted circumstance.  
      
       
     41 It was obviously open to his Honour to take the matter identified into account as a special circumstance. Against an overall sentence of four and a half years, a non-parole period of two and a half years was generous. In my view, it was sufficient to cater for this consideration, along with the desirability of providing an extended period of release on parole during which the applicant might demonstrate some interest in addressing his drug dependency and his mental issues. Otherwise, the present is not a case of the kind involving informers or police officers, or offenders who have provided assistance, whose imprisonment is, as a consequence, more dangerous, such that some moderation of sentence is called for. Nor is it a case where, upon the evidence available to the sentencing court or to us, the mental disorder of the applicant has been shown to be of such a degree or nature as to make his imprisonment more onerous to the point where the head sentences should be reduced. 
      
       
        
       Ground 6 
        - In all the circumstances of both objective and subjective features in the applicant's case, the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive. 
        
       
     42 So far as this is a catchall ground, relying upon the various grounds which I have dealt with so far, none of them has been shown to have merit. This ground accordingly fares no better, that is, subject to the matter to which I will next turn, namely the accumulation of sentence. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        - The learned sentencing judge erred in passing consecutive sentences in his assessment of totality and in his application of Pearce v The Queen. 
        
       
     43 One basis for this submission was, in substance, the same as that for ground 2, and rests upon the proposition that the sentences individually selected were too high. That is not a proposition which I accept, it being open to his Honour to have had regard to the applicant's antecedents, and in particular to the repetitive nature of his re-offending, when selecting an appropriate sentence for each offence.  
      
       
     44 Whether or not there should be an accumulation of sentences in order to reflect the overall totality involved, is very much a matter of discretion. In a case where the offender consistently resorts to stealing, in order to feed a drug habit and does so while on parole, and where he has been persistent with this conduct, even though he had been spoken to by police while caught in the act some days previously, it is difficult to understand why some accumulation of sentences was not appropriate. 
      
       
     45 It appears that his Honour took the course of first determining appropriate sentences for the individual counts, namely two years for count 4, four years for each of counts 1 and 2, and three years for count 3; of then fixing upon an accumulated head sentence of six years, which he discounted by 25 percent, for the pleas, to one of four years and six months, which was then distributed between the various counts, to come up with the individual sentences.  
      
       
     46 With respect, this was a somewhat cumbersome and inappropriate way of dealing with the matter, which could just as easily and preferably have been approached by determining appropriate sentences individually for each count, after applying a discount for the relevant subjective factors, including the pleas, and by then turning to questions of accumulation. 
      
       
     47 When reviewed on appeal, it is the task of this Court to examine whether any sentence, including the overall sentence, other than imposed, is warranted by law and should have been imposed: see S 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at paras 74-80, 90 and 100. 
      
       
     48 In this regard, I have come to the conclusion that the extent of the accumulation, which was involved in the sentencing exercise undertaken was excessive in the light of the total criminality involved, particularly when regard is given to the somewhat confined time span which the offences encompassed.  
      
       
     49 I would, for this reason, grant leave to appeal and I would allow the appeal so as to adjust the commencement dates for the various sentences. I would propose, in this regard, that the sentences be varied so as to make the sentences for counts 4, 2 and 3 concurrent and that for count 1, cumulative upon that for count 4. 
      
       
     50 Upon that basis I would propose that the following sentencing order be substituted for that made by his Honour: 
      
       
        
       In relation to count 4, I would propose a fixed term of nine months imprisonment to commence on 24 August 2001 and to expire on 23 May 2002. 
        
       For count 2, I would propose a fixed term of 16 months similarly to commence on 24 August 2001 and to expire on 23 December 2002. 
        
       For count 3, I would propose a fixed term of 12 months, similarly to commence on 24 August 2001 and to expire on 23 August 2002. 
        
       For count 1, I would propose that the sentence of three years imposed by his Honour be preserved, but that such sentence commence at the expiry of the sentence for count 4, that is, on 24 May 2002 and expire on 23 May 2005. In relation to that sentence I would propose that there be a non-parole period of one year to commence on 24 May 2002 and to expire on 23 May 2003. 
        
       
     51 The total sentence so adjusted would accordingly be one of three years and nine months with an effective non-parole period of one year and nine months.52 On that basis I would make an order that the applicant be released to parole under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service on 23 May 2003. 
      
       
     53 HOWIE J: I agree. 
      
       
     54 WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders of the Court will be as I proposed.

     3 Howie J: The appellant was arraigned before a jury in the District Court on an indictment containing two counts as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         For that he between 1 January 1996 and 29 August 1996 at Wyong in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], a person under the age of six years. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, that he between 1 September 2000 and 2 October 2000 at Shoalhaven Heads in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 10 years in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the sexual intercourse [the complainant] was under the authority of himself. 
         
        
       
     4 He was convicted by a jury of each count on the indictment and sentenced by Judge Armitage as follows: Count 1 - imprisonment for eight years to date from 12 October 2001 and to expire on 11 October 2009 with a non-parole period of six years to expire on 11 October 2007; Count 2 - imprisonment for six years to date from 12 October 2001 and to expire on 11 October 2007 with a non-parole period of four years and six months to expire on 11 April 2006. 
      
       
     5 The appellant appeals against both the convictions and the sentence imposed upon him. The following grounds of appeal have been relied upon before this Court in the appeal against conviction: 
      
       
        
         
          
         Ground 1. His Honour erred in law on both counts in his directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately and properly as to the evidence of the complainant. 
          
          
         Ground 2. His Honour erred in law in failing to warn the jury that it was ""dangerous to convict"". 
          
          
         Ground 3. His Honour erred in law in his directing and/or failing to direct the jury as to 
          
           
            
           (a) delay in respect of both counts. 
            
            
           (b) the fact that there was no complaint as to the first count and the delay in complaint in respect of the second count 
            
            
           (c) the use to which and effect of the complaint after the second count in respect of the complainant's credit and the appellant's defence in respect to both counts. 
           
          
          
         Ground 5. The verdicts of the jury were unsafe and gave rise to a miscarriage of justice 
          
           
            
           (a) in that the offences charged were not identified with sufficient particularity to differentiate them from the allegations of offences not charged. 
            
            
           (b) in that they were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
           
          
         
        
        
       Grounds 4 and 6, as originally filed, were not relied upon on the hearing of the appeal. 
        
       
     6 The complainant was born on 15 December 1989 and lived with her mother and the appellant at Wyong during 1996. The complainant alleged that on one night between January and August 1996, while her mother was out of the house working, the appellant engaged in intercourse with her by inserting his penis into her vagina while she was lying on her back on the double bed in the appellant’s bedroom. She said that this was the first act of intercourse between the appellant and herself and it hurt her, causing her to cry. The appellant ejaculated onto her stomach and then cleaned her with a towel that was beside the bed. This incident gave rise to the first count on the indictment. 
      
       
     7 The second count related to what the complainant alleged was the last occasion on which the appellant sexually assaulted her. This incident occurred in September 2000 when the complainant was staying with her grandmother, Ms Gray, in Shoalhaven Heads for the school holidays. At this time the appellant was living in the same area with his daughter, Mickayla, he and the complainant's mother having separated. On some occasions during this period the complainant stayed at the appellant's house when her grandmother was working late. The complainant alleged that on one of these occasions she was sleeping in a bedroom with Mickayla when the appellant came into the room and told her to go into his bedroom. There he undressed and told her to take off her clothing, which she did. The appellant began kissing her with an open mouth. While she was lying on her back on his bed, the appellant lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina while telling her, ""Look at me"". 
      
       
     8 The complainant gave evidence that, between the two occasions that gave rise to the counts in the indictment, similar incidents took place “heaps"" of times. In particular she alleged that the appellant had “sexed"" her on about ten occasions at Wyong while her mother was at work and about five times in his house at Shoalhaven Heads. She also alleged that he had sexually assaulted her on about six occasions when they were living in Kalgoorlie. These allegations were relied upon by the Crown as part of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant to be used by the jury to place the particular offences charged in the indictment into the context of the whole of the allegations made about the conduct of the appellant by the complainant. 
      
       
     9 In October 2000 the complainant and her brother, Owen, returned to their mother from Shoalhaven Heads. At that time the complainant and her family were staying at the home of Karen McMahon and her family while they waited for their own accommodation to become available. On one afternoon the complainant drew a picture of a man with an erect penis. When questioned about this by her mother and Ms McMahon, the complainant indicated that it was a picture of the appellant. When asked if he had touched her “where he was not supposed to"", the complainant nodded. 
      
       
     10 The complainant was taken by her mother to a paediatrician, Dr Packer, who on 31 October 2001 examined the complainant. The doctor found that the complainant's genital area was such as to suggest severe damage to the hymen over a period of time. Dr Packer gave her opinion that the damage had been caused by repeated episodes of penetration of the hymen by a penis or an object of similar dimensions. She was of the view that the injuries were more likely to have been caused over a period of months or years rather than over a period of weeks. Dr Packer received a history from the complainant of sexual abuse of her by the appellant on a number of occasions. In particular, the complainant told her that the appellant would put on ""rude movies"" and then touch her all over with his hands. She said that he would put a ""cover"" on his penis and would use cream. Dr Packer believed, from the history she received from the complainant, that most episodes of sexual assault had occurred earlier that year, that is 2000. However, she stated that children, who had suffered episodes of abuse over a period of time, initially focused on the most recent episodes of abuse until questioned further about the matter. 
      
       
     11 The complainant was questioned by a police officer by way of a recorded interview on 7 November 2000. The appellant was arrested shortly thereafter and on 23 November participated in a lengthy interview with police during which he denied the allegations made by the complainant. 
      
       
     12 The complainant's grandmother, Ms Gray, gave evidence that the complainant and her brother came to stay with her at Shoalhaven Heads sometime before 10 September 2000 for the school holidays. She said that the appellant offered to mind the children while she was at work. She usually finished work about 6 pm but occasionally had to work late and on these occasions the children stayed overnight at the appellant's house. This had occurred on five occasions. Ms Gray said that sometime between 25 and 29 September she had a conversation with the appellant about the children's bedtimes. The appellant told her that the complainant was up until 1:30am. Ms Gray indicated to the appellant that she did not like the children staying up so late. A day or two later the complainant's mother arrived to take the children back to Canberra. 
      
       
     13 Ms Gray gave evidence that about two weeks later she received a telephone call from the complainant's mother. As a result of that conversation she went to see the appellant and said to him ""You know what [the complainant's mother] accused you of? You've been interfering with [the complainant]”. Ms Gray said that the appellant had just sat on a stool, saying nothing. She then said to him ""Aren't you angry that she says things like that?"" He replied, ""Yeah, of course I am, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her"". 
      
       
     14 Ms McMahon, with whom the complainant’s family was living in Canberra, gave evidence that on a day prior to 15 October 2000, the complainant's mother asked her to go outside and speak to the complainant who had been drawing. Ms McMahon saw a picture of a man with a large penis and testicles and asked the complainant, “Who is this and what is this picture?"" The complainant began to cry and said it was of the appellant. Ms McMahon asked if he had “put it inside her” and the complainant said, ""Yes"". The complainant told Ms McMahon that this had happened when her mother went to work at night and the appellant would put ""dirty pictures"" on the television and would then call her into the room. Ms McMahon initially kept the picture, which she placed on top of a refrigerator, but after two or three months, when she had heard nothing further from the complainant's mother, she threw it away. 
      
       
     15 The complainant's mother gave evidence that she commenced a relationship with the appellant in October 1995. In early 1996 she lived with the appellant and the complainant in a house at Wyong for a few months. During that period two teenaged couples lived as boarders with them for a period of about one and half months. At this time the complainant's mother worked three or four nights a week and the appellant took care of the complainant at those times. The family moved to Kalgoorlie in October 1998 where the appellant looked after the complainant and Mickayla while she was working at night. In about August 1999 they moved to Shoalhaven Heads where they lived in a caravan park until she separated from the appellant about two or three weeks after they arrived there. From about 23 December 1999, when the complainant and her mother moved to Rylstone, until the September 2000 school holidays, when the complainant and her brother went to stay with Ms Gray, the complainant had no contact with the appellant.  
      
       
     16 The complainant's mother told the jury that in early October 2000 she and her then family went to stay with Ms McMahon in Canberra. On 8 October the complainant and her brother were outside drawing when Owen came into the house and told her that the complainant was drawing rude pictures. She went outside and saw a picture of a man with an erect penis. She asked the complainant why she was drawing pictures like that and the complainant burst into tears. When asked if someone had touched her ""where they're not supposed to"", the complainant replied that they had. When the complainant's mother asked who it was, the complainant named the appellant. The complainant's mother then asked Ms McMahon to go and talk to the complainant. A short time later she contacted the Canberra Children's Hospital. 
      
       
     17 The appellant gave evidence that he was not guilty of the charges in the indictment and relied upon his denials of the allegations in his interview with police. It was his case that the complainant had lied about the allegations at the behest of her mother so that she could gain custody of Mickayla. The appellant gave evidence that, during the period when the complainant was staying with her grandmother in Shoalhaven Heads, an argument had taken place between himself and the complainant's mother in which she had said words to the effect of ""I'm going to get you"". She also said, ""You know what I am like, you dog, I'll do anything to get you back"". The appellant gave evidence that the complainant had stayed at his house in Shoalhaven Heads only twice and on one occasion with Owen. He agreed that he had in his possession a pornographic video as described by the complainant but denied that he had ever shown it to her. 
      
       
     18 The first ground of appeal complains of a failure of the trial judge to give the jury a warning during the course of his summing up in respect of the fact that the complainant's evidence was given both by way of a tape-recorded interview with an investigating police officer and by closed-circuit television under the provisions of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997. 
      
       
     19 Section 11 of that Act provides, in effect, that a child may give evidence in chief by way of the playing of a recording of the questioning of the child by a police officer made in connection with the investigation of the commission of an offence and, during the course of which questioning, the child has made allegations against the accused. If a child witness gives evidence in this manner, the child must be available for cross-examination and re-examination either orally in the courtroom or in accordance with an arrangement made under Part 4 of the Act. Section 14 provides 
      
       
        
         
         If a child gives evidence of a previous representation wholly or partly in the form of a recording made by an investigating official in accordance with this Part in any proceedings in which there is a jury, the judge must warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the evidence being given in that way. 
         
        
       
     20 Section 18 of that Act entitles a child to give evidence by means of closed-circuit television in proceedings in which it is alleged that a person has committed a “personal assault offence”, which includes an offence of the nature of those charged in the indictment. Section 25 relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         25(1) In any criminal proceedings in which the evidence of a child is given by means of closed-circuit television facilities or any other similar technology (by virtue of section 18), the judge must: 
          
          
           
           (a) inform the jury that it is standard procedure for children's evidence in such cases to be given by those means, and 
            
            
           (b) warn the jury not to draw any inference adverse to the accused person or give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because of the use of those facilities or that technology. 
           
          
         
        
       
     21 Although it is conceded that the trial judge complied with both ss 14 and 25(1) in his initial remarks to the jury before the evidence commenced, it is submitted that his Honour was required to repeat what he had said at that time during the course of the summing up and that his failure to do so was an error. 
      
       
     22 For the purposes of dealing with this ground of appeal it is unnecessary to set out in detail what His Honour said to the jury concerning the fact that the complainant was to give evidence both by way of a taped recording of the interview with the investigating police officer and that she was giving evidence before the jury by way of closed-circuit television. It is sufficient to state that there was no suggestion on the hearing of this appeal that his Honour in any way misdirected the jury or failed to comply with the requirements of ss 14 and 25(1) of the Act. The jury was fully and effectively informed and warned of the matters set out in those sections. 
      
       
     23 For my part, I believe it is highly preferable that a trial judge gives such information and warnings as are required in respect of a particular part of the evidence that is to be given in a trial before a jury either immediately before or immediately after the giving of that evidence rather than to wait to fulfil that obligation during the course of the summing up. Generally speaking, it would be expected that any information or warning that a jury is required to consider in their assessment of a particular piece of evidence would have considerably more impact upon the jury if given at a time proximate to the evidence. This does not mean that it would not be advisable, or even necessary in some cases, to convey that information or warning again during the course of the summing up. But whether such a course is necessary in order to ensure a fair trial and one according to law will depend upon all the circumstances of the particular case and the nature of the information or warning that must be given. 
      
       
     24 In the present case his Honour said all that was necessary in order to comply with ss 14 and 25(1) immediately before the substantive part of the trial commenced. The complainant was the first witness called by the Crown immediately following the Crown Prosecutor’s opening. There is no reason to suppose that the jury would have forgotten what his Honour had said to them about the manner in which they were to approach the complainant's evidence when her evidence commenced by way of closed-circuit television and then the playing of the tape-recorded questioning of her by the police officer. 
      
       
     25 The trial commenced on 8 October 2001 and the trial judge began his summing up three days later on 11 October. The jury embarked upon its deliberations first thing the next morning. During the course of the summing up, when directing the jury on the way they were to approach their task of assessing witnesses in the case, his Honour made observations concerning the difficulty the jury might have in taking into account the demeanour of the complainant by reason of the fact that she gave evidence by closed-circuit television. It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail what the trial judge said to the jury in that regard. At this point in the summing up, his Honour might have again reminded the jury of the matters contained in ss 14 and 25(1) of the Act but it was not obligatory upon him to do so and no request was made that he do so. 
      
       
     26 The ground as amplified in oral submissions was as follows. In the summing up, after his Honour had given various directions, comments and warnings to the jury and before moving on to canvass the evidence, the trial judge said to the jury “these are the directions of law that I am required to give you”. His Honour had not at this point conveyed to the jury, in the summing up, the information and warning required under the sections. Therefore, the jury might have disregarded what his Honour had said earlier about the manner in which the complainant had given her evidence. 
      
       
     27 This Court should eschew such an overly technical, formalistic and unrealistic approach to a consideration of whether a trial was in accordance with the law. But there is an equally technical, formalistic and probably unrealistic answer that can be given to the complaint: ss 14 and 25(1) require no direction of law to be given by a trial judge. The sections merely require that certain information and warnings be given to the jury. But in any event, I am far from satisfied that there was a requirement for the trial judge in the circumstances of this case to have once again informed and warned the jury of the matters set out in the sections, or, if there was, that the failure to do so resulted in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. Insofar as leave is required under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to argue this ground of appeal, that leave should be refused. 
      
       
     28 The second ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in law in failing to warn the jury that it was ""dangerous to convict"" on the evidence of the complainant. Support for this ground of appeal is said to be found in the decision of the High Court in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 and a long line of decisions both of the High Court and this Court dealing with the proper warnings, comments, and directions to be given in cases where there has been a lengthy delay between the date of the alleged offence and the trial of the accused for that offence. It is unnecessary in the present case to do more than acknowledge their existence. But I do not believe that they reveal that a rule of practice or of law existed at the time of this trial requiring that the jury be directed that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of the complainant whenever such delay had occurred. 
      
       
     29 In R v SJF [2000] NSW CCA 294 this Court was concerned with the directions and warnings given by a trial judge to a jury in a case in which there was a delay in complaint in respect of some counts and no delay in respect of others and where the complainant was alleging that there was a continuing course of conduct over the period during which the alleged offences occurred. A ground of appeal, which asserted that the trial judge was in error in failing to direct the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant's evidence or that it was necessary to scrutinise her evidence with care, was rejected. In giving the reasons of the Court for dismissing the appeal, with which reasons Stein JA and Greg James J. concurred, I said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         30 Although in most cases of delay it will be essential to warn the jury that it would be dangerous to convict, I am not persuaded that such a warning was required in the present case in order to ensure a fair trial to the accused. In the evidence before her Honour there was neither the extensive delay or the concatenation of factors which has been present in cases where the expression ""dangerous to convict"" has been required, see  
         R v SJB 
          [2002] NSWCCA 163 at [52] (a case in which the desirability of such a warning was apparent to defence counsel who requested one). Although there was a delay in respect of the first seven counts, there was none in respect of the last two counts. Whether a warning is required is not a matter of mathematical calculation, but the extent of the delay and the consequential prejudice are clearly relevant matters. The fifth, sixth and seventh counts occurred a little more than twelve months before the complaint and there could have been little actual prejudice, if any, suffered by the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         31 In my view, reading the summing up as a whole and in the context of the issues raised, the jury was sufficiently warned about the approach they were to take to the evidence of the complainant, both by reason of the importance of her evidence to the Crown case and because of the prejudice to the accused caused by the delay, to ensure that the accused received a fair trial. A judicial caution was given in relation to reliance upon the evidence of the complainant, appropriate comments were made as to the effect of delay upon the reliability of the complainant and other Crown witnesses, and the jury were told in sufficiently clear terms of the potential and actual prejudice suffered by the appellant because of the delay in complaint. The summary quoted above would have been unexceptional had her Honour referred to the necessity to scrutinise the complainant's evidence with care. I cannot accept that the requirement for an appropriate summing up to meet the circumstances of a particular case has descended to such formalism that the failure to use particular words or the expression ""dangerous to convict"" amounts to an error of law in every case of delay 
         
        
       
     30 In the present case, I am unpersuaded that it was necessary, either as a matter of law or in order to ensure a fair trial to the appellant, that the trial judge use the phrase ""dangerous to convict"" in warning the jury as to the approach to be taken when assessing the complainant's evidence. No such warning was sought by an apparently competent defence counsel. However, simply because that particular warning was not required in the circumstances of this case, it does not necessarily follow that the summing up was adequate to ensure a fair trial for the accused in light of the delay in the prosecution of the allegation contained in the first count. That is a matter taken up in the next ground of appeal. 
      
       
     31 Ground 3 asserts that the summing up was deficient in a number of respects in relation to what his Honour said to the jury as to the way they should approach the evidence before them. The first complaint under this ground is that his Honour failed to direct the jury as to the effect of delay in the prosecution of both counts in the indictment. As I have already indicated, there was no complaint made by the complainant in respect of the conduct of the appellant until October 2000, yet she alleged a history of sexual abuse upon her from some date between January and August 1996. There was thus a delay of over four years before any allegation was made about the commencement of the alleged sexual assaults committed by the appellant. 
      
       
     32 It is now clearly established that, where delay in the prosecution of an offence has resulted in prejudice to the accused at his trial, the trial judge must make the jury aware of the existence of the prejudice and indicate to them how they are to use that matter in their assessment of the evidence in the Crown case, see R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 376-377; Doggett v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 1290. On some occasions the prejudice or potential prejudice will be such that, in the circumstances of the particular case, the jury should be directed that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of the complainant and that they should do so only after scrutinising that evidence with care having regard to the warning given to them. Although this was not a case that required such a warning or direction, it was a trial in which his Honour should have averted to the prejudice to the accused caused by the delay in complaint in order to ensure that he received a fair trial. 
      
       
     33 The law now requires that, in any case of significant delay in the prosecution of an offence, the jury is to be directed that the accused has been prejudiced in his defence of the charge by the delay and that matter is to be taken into account by the jury in determining whether to act upon the evidence of the complainant. Such a direction is to be given even if no actual prejudice can be identified: R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60. If it can be shown that actual prejudice has been caused to the accused in defending himself, that prejudice is to be identified for the jury with particularity; R v Johnston, above. In my opinion the delay in complaint and the consequential prejudice to the accused in defending the first count required the trial judge to bring that matter to the attention of the jury and to direct them as to the need to consider that prejudice in determining whether or not to accept the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     34 On the hearing of the appeal the Crown Prosecutor argued that, in the circumstances of the present case, it was unnecessary for any comment, warning or direction to be given to the jury as to the effect of delay. This, it was submitted, was because the delay and consequential prejudice were not issues ventilated by the defence during the course of the trial. The defence case was that the allegations made by the complainant and the evidence of complaint to her mother and Ms McMahon were fabricated so that the complainant's mother could gain custody of Mickayla. In those circumstances, so the argument ran, no significant prejudice could have been suffered by the applicant or, at the very least, no direction or warning was required to be given by the trial judge as to the effects of delay where none was sought by defence counsel. 
      
       
     35 In my opinion that argument must be rejected. The necessity for a trial judge to ensure a fair trial for the accused is not circumscribed by the manner in which the trial is conducted by defence counsel or the particular defence relied upon by the accused. The first two propositions stated by Spigelman CJ in R v Johnston, above, at 474 emphasise the obligation falling upon the trial judge and are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by the delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
          
          
         (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that the jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
         
        
       
     36 Rather than relieving a trial judge from taking what course is necessary to ensure a fair trial, the conduct of the defence may impose upon the trial judge the burden of ensuring that the jury is not distracted from a proper assessment of the prosecution case by the nature of the defence or the evidence of the accused. But in any event, the obligation imposed upon the trial judge in cases of delay has become more burdensome since R v Johnston was decided. Prejudice to an accused in defending himself is now presumed as a result of delay in the prosecution of a sexual assault offence and, accordingly, in any case of significant delay the jury must have that prejudice brought to their attention; R v BWT, above. 
      
       
     37 But significant delay does not merely affect the ability of the accused to defend himself by depriving him of the opportunity to gather evidence which might at least place a doubt upon the Crown case. It can also prejudice the accused in a more subtle way, as occurred in the present case. By reason of the delay, the complainant was necessarily vague as to the specific occasion upon which she alleged that the first act of intercourse occurred. She was also unable to supply any particularity to the history of sexual assaults that she alleged had been committed upon her except by relating them to the place where they occurred. 
      
       
     38 The difficulty for an accused person in rebutting that evidence is obvious, at least to the legal mind. On the other hand, a jury might readily accept that, even if the complainant were telling the truth about her allegations, she would, by reason of her young age, the delay and the number of incidents of sexual abuse alleged by her, have difficulty giving any but the barest detail of the circumstances surrounding them. Such a situation might even engender some sympathy for the complainant when those defending the accused require particularity and consistency in her evidence and criticise her when it is not forthcoming. Where such a possibility arises, it is necessary for the trial judge to bring home to the jury the consequences of delay upon the accused’s ability to test the Crown’s case. It may even be necessary for the trial judge to make it clear to the jury that the delay may have caused the Crown witnesses to become unreliable or in some other way have weakened the Crown case rather than to allow the jury to act on the basis that the delay might excuse or explain apparent defects in the evidence of those witnesses. 
      
       
     39 In the present case, rather than warn the jury about the effect of the delay upon the ability of the accused to defend himself or to test the Crown case, the trial judge reminded the jury of a submission made by the Crown Prosecutor on the effects of delay as follows (my emphasis): 
      
       
        
         
         Well members of the jury what I want to do at this stage is in a very broad way indicate to you how it seems to me that the Crown endeavours to put its case. The case for the Crown is in essence that [the complainant's] evidence is credible and reliable and it is safe for you to act upon it.  
         Any inconsistencies or discrepancies in that evidence the Crown says are of a minor nature and the sort of things you would expect [of] the evidence of a truthful 11 year-old girl casting her mind back to events that took place between 1996 and September 2000 
         . 
         
        
       
     40 In the present case the failure of the trial judge to refer to the effects of delay and its impact upon the appellant's ability to defend himself from the allegations made against him resulted in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice notwithstanding that neither counsel assisted the trial judge by seeking such comments, warnings, or directions as were necessary to ensure a fair trial. Therefore, I would grant leave under rule 4 for the appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal and uphold it. 
      
       
     41 The second aspect of the summing up about which criticism is made in the third ground of appeal is that relating to his Honour's directions in respect of the evidence of complaint. As I have indicated earlier in this judgment, evidence was admitted before the jury of an occasion in early October 2000 when the complainant told her mother, and then Ms McMahon, that the accused had sexually interfered with her. This allegation arose in circumstances when the complainant had been questioned about a drawing she had made of a male figure with an exaggerated penis. 
      
       
     42 That evidence was not relied upon by the Crown as recent complaint admitted under s 66(2) of the Evidence Act and which could have been used by the jury as evidence of the truth of the allegations contained in the complaint or as evidence of conduct consistent with her allegations. Rather the evidence was admitted on the basis that it rebutted the suggestion to be made to the complainant that she had fabricated the allegations against the accused at the instigation of her mother. The evidence was admitted by the trial judge relying upon s 108(3) of the Act. 
      
       
     43 It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence was admitted notwithstanding that his Honour had not granted leave to the Crown as required under that section. It was further argued that, in any event, the evidence was not admissible for the purpose for which it was admitted. Reliance was placed on the decision of the High Court in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606 to support this contention. It was further submitted that, in light of the fact that the accused asserted that the evidence of the complaint was itself fabricated, the evidence could not be admitted to support the complainant’s credibility. 
      
       
     44 In my view it is unnecessary to deal with this third argument in any detail. The proposition that, because an accused asserts that evidence of a complaint was fabricated it necessarily follows that the evidence is rendered inadmissible, is patently untenable. It is matter for a jury to decide whether or not to accept a witness’s account that the complainant made an allegation that the accused sexually assaulted her. I can think of no instance where it has been held that, simply because evidence is disputed by one of the parties to the proceedings, that evidence is rendered inadmissible or deprived of any relevance it might otherwise have had. 
      
       
     45 The fact that a piece of evidence is in dispute might be a relevant consideration in determining whether or not to reject the evidence in the exercise of a discretion that for some reason or other arises. This is because the fact that the evidence is disputed affects its weight, see Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 482. In the present case the fact that the evidence of complaint was disputed might be a matter relevant to the decision whether or not to grant leave to the Crown to call the evidence. But, in my view, that is the only relevance of the fact that the accused was asserting that the evidence of complaint was itself fabricated by the witnesses who gave the evidence. 
      
       
     46 No transcription was made of the argument concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the complainant’s mother or Ms McMahon in respect of the allegations made by the complainant to them. The following is recorded in the transcript: 
      
       
        
         
         Medical report of Dr Susan Packer of 3/11/00 given to his Honour. On Page 2 of the report, the last two paragraphs and page 3, paragraph 1 will be led in evidence as a relevant history provided by the complainant. The evidence which will be led from the doctor will be as a history that forms the basis of her opinion not as complaint evidence. The Crown asked to restrict the evidence under section 136 of the Evidence Act as going to the credit of the Complainant only. 
          
          
         The Crown will also be calling Karen McMahon and the mother of the complainant,….. 
          
          
         On 8 October 2000 two separate conversations were held with the complainant. This is not admissible evidence of complaint, but the Crown seeks to lead this evidence under section 108(3) of the Evidence Act and also to show the credit of the complainant. 
          
          
         Discussion ensured re section 192 of Evidence Act. 
          
          
         Restrict evidence of credit under section 136 of Evidence Act. 
          
          
         The Crown questioned whether the complainant was competent to give evidence under oath under section 13(1) of the Evidence Act. She would be able to give others warned evidence, but this would be a matter for his Honour. Discussion ensued as to what will be done. 
          
          
         The Crown indicated what parts of the ERISP dated 7/11/00 would be removed. Page 25, questioned 215-222 inclusive. 
          
          
         Mr Hoare indicated he has no objection to the manner in which the evidence will be admitted. Complaint is admissible under section 108(3)(b) because defence is one of fabrication. The complaint evidence is not corroborative. 
         
        
       
     47 In light of what is recorded in the transcript, and, in particular, the apparent concession made by the appellant's then legal representative that the evidence of complaint was admissible, it is almost disingenuous for a protest now to be raised that his Honour admitted the evidence without formally granting leave. However, in oral submissions counsel for the appellant did not seek to argue that the trial miscarried by the failure, if there was any, to grant leave. He accepted that the appellant was bound by the conduct of his representative at the trial and was content to rely upon the grounds of appeal concerned with the directions his Honour gave the jury about the evidence. 
      
       
     48 The first argument relied upon was to the effect that his Honour could not give any direction to the jury as to the use to be made of the evidence of complaint because there was no legitimate use to which it could be put. It was submitted that, because the evidence had been erroneously admitted after the concession made by defence counsel, his Honour should have said nothing about it at all. 
      
       
     49 To consider this and the other criticisms made of the directions given with respect to the evidence of complaint, it is necessary to very briefly summarise the chronology of events. The complainant alleged that the first act of sexual misconduct was that in the first count which occurred sometime between January and August 1996. There was, thereafter, repeated acts of sexual intercourse until some time in September 2000. The first occasion when the complainant raised any allegation of sexual misconduct by the appellant toward her was 8 October 2000, when she was questioned by her mother and then Ms McMahon. Dr Packer examined the complainant on 31 October and she was eventually interviewed by the investigating police officer on 7 November 2000. 
      
       
     50 It is clear that the evidence of what the complainant said to her mother and Ms McMahon on 8 October could not have been admitted as evidence of recent complaint in respect of either count in the indictment. Indeed the Crown did not seek to lead the evidence on that basis. It was admitted in order to rebut the suggestion that the complainant had fabricated her allegations. The evidence was only relevant if in some way it could assist the jury in determining whether that suggestion might possibly be true. In Graham v The Queen, above, at 609 in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ it was stated:  
      
       
        
         
         [8]  
         In exercising the discretion under s 108(3) to permit the adducing of evidence of a prior consistent statement, it is important to bear two matters in mind. First, s 108 creates an exception to the ""credibility rule"" -- the rule that evidence that is relevant  
         only 
          to a witness's credibility is not admissible (s 102). Second, it is important to identify how the evidence relates to the statutory premise for its admission. Whether, if admissible, the complaint becomes evidence of the truth of what is asserted is not relevant to the exercise of the discretion to give leave under s 108. The exercise of the discretion under s 108 depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication.  
          
         
        
       
     51 I have some difficulty, on the material before this Court and without hearing full argument on the matter, in appreciating how it would have assisted the members of the jury in determining whether the allegations made to the doctor on 31st October 2000, to the police on 7 November 2000, and during the trial were fabricated by the jury being made aware that the complainant had made similar allegations on 8 October 2000 to her mother and Ms McMahon. Even if it might have had some little relevance to a consideration of the allegation in the second count in the indictment, it seems to me to have had no relevance at all to the allegation in the first count. I make these comments merely because, as it seems to me that this appeal must be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered, I do not wish it to be assumed by the parties or any future trial judge that this Court has accepted that the evidence was admissible under s 108(3) or that leave ought to be given to the Crown to adduce it. 
      
       
     52 But it is unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal to determine whether the evidence should have been placed before the jury. As I have already indicated, the only ground argued about the admissibility of the evidence was that his Honour had not actually granted leave to the Crown. Counsel for the appellant conceded that, even if that ground of appeal were successful, it would not justify the setting aside of the convictions. Similarly, it is unnecessary to determine whether his Honour could have given any sensible direction to the jury as to the use to be made of that evidence assuming that it was properly before the jury. That complaint is, in effect, an argument about the admissibility of the evidence in a different guise and should not be entertained. 
      
       
     53 However, it was further argued that, even if the evidence had been properly admitted, the directions given by the trial judge in respect of that evidence were erroneous. It is, therefore, necessary to set out what his Honour said to the jury in respect of the evidence of the complainant's mother and Ms McMahon. It was as follows (my emphasis) 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, members of the jury, I need to say this to you about that evidence. The Crown has led this evidence in order to meet the suggestion made by the accused that the complainant, [ ], has not told you the truth in her evidence here in court.  
         The Crown argues that the time at which the complaint was made, well that was October, very shortly after this last alleged incident, the time at which the complaint was made together with the circumstances in which it was made demonstrate that her version has always been consistent. 
          In other words the evidence is relevant to the credit of [the complainant] as a witness in that  
         it may increase the weight which you give to her evidence as to the alleged sexual assault with which the accused is charged 
         . However, it is not evidence as to what actually happened between the complainant, [ ], and the accused as the person to whom the complaint was made was not present and did not see what happened between them 
          
          
         Now on the other hand the defence says that you would not accept the evidence of these two witnesses. It is put to you by the defence that they are good friends and it is pointed out to you that the picture allegedly drawn has mysteriously disappeared and, as I understand it, it is suggested to you that this story has been concocted between these two women. The submission made by the defence is that [the complainant] did not say what those two women alleged she said."" 
         
        
        
       After referring the jury to the competing arguments made by the Crown and the defence in respect of that evidence, his Honour went on: 
        
        
         
         “However I remind you that the evidence is not there to prove what actually happened. It is there because in the Crown's submission it is relevant to [the complainant's] credibility. The accused, through his counsel, Mr Hoare, has put to [the complainant] that the alleged sexual assaults did not take place. The Crown submits that the evidence of [the complainant's] mother and Karen McMahon shows that  
         within a few weeks of the assault allege[d] [in the] second charge [the complainant] actually told them that she had been sexually assaulted. The Crown puts to you that that demonstrates [the complainant's] consistency 
         .” 
         
        
       
     54 It is argued on behalf of the appellant that these directions were erroneous in that they gave the evidence a greater relevance to the credibility of the complainant than was appropriate for evidence admitted under s 108(3). In effect, it was submitted that those directions would have been appropriate only if the evidence had been admitted as recent complaint. In my view there is merit in that submission. 
      
       
     55 The credibility rule is found in s 102 of the Evidence Act. That rule provides that evidence, which is relevant only to a witness’s credibility, is not admissible. Evidence of recent complaint is admitted now, not as evidence relevant to the complainant's credibility per se, as it was at common law, but as first person hearsay under s 66(2) of the Act, see Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 267. It is, therefore, admissible both as to the truth of the allegation made in the complaint and (because it is not relevant only to the complainant's credibility) as to the consistency of conduct on the part of the complainant that makes it more likely that she is credible in respect of the allegation she makes: R v Lillyman [1896] 2 QB 167 at 170; Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460. 
      
       
     56 As was pointed out in the passage from Graham v The Queen, which I have quoted above, the admissibility of evidence under s 108(3) is an exception to the credibility rule. It is admitted for a purpose different from that for which evidence of recent complaint is placed before the jury. It is evidence of a prior consistent statement which is relevant to rebut an attack upon the complainant's general credibility which arises either by the introduction of a statement which is inconsistent with the evidence given in the trial or because of an allegation that the evidence given in court is a fabrication, reconstruction, or the result of suggestion. Because the statement is being admitted to meet that particular attack, the timing of the making of the statement, generally speaking, will be more important than the circumstance in which the statement is made. 
      
       
     57 There are a number of differences between evidence of complaint admitted under s 66(2) and evidence of a prior consistent statement admitted with leave under s 108(3). The main distinction is, of course, that evidence admitted under the former section is principally evidence going to the truth of what is asserted in the complaint. But unless limited under s 136, evidence admitted under the latter section can also be used for this purpose by reason of the operation of s 60. The fact that the statement is made close to the conduct to which it relates is not a crucial requirement for admissibility under s 108(3) as it is when complaint evidence is being tendered under s 66(2). Further, the evidence is not being admitted in order to show consistent conduct on the part of the complainant following the incident alleged in the complaint but rather to restore the complainant’s credit that has been impugned either by proof that the witness has made a statement inconsistent with the evidence now being given or an allegation that the evidence that is being given is a fabrication, reconstruction or the result of suggestion. In this regard evidence admitted under s 108(3) is relevant to the complainant's credibility, either generally or in a particular respect, whereas evidence admitted under s 66(2) is relevant to the complainant's credibility in respect of the particular allegation or allegations raised in the complaint. 
      
       
     58 The passages which I have underlined from those parts of the summing up concerning the evidence of what was said by the complainant to her mother and Ms McMahon on 3 October show, in my respectful opinion, a confusion, or at least a blurring, of the distinction between evidence admitted as hearsay evidence under s 66(2) and evidence of a prior consistent statement admitted under s 108(3). In particular, the passage in the second quote refers to the complainant's consistency arising from the fact that she complained at a time shortly after the assault that gave rise to the second count. The direction refers to a submission to that effect made by the Crown Prosecutor to the jury in answer to an assertion put to the complainant by defence counsel that the sexual assaults had not occurred. I am unable to see how such a direction differs from that which would be given in respect of evidence admitted as recent complaint. 
      
       
     59 Further, the directions make no distinction between such relevance as the evidence might have had to the second count on the indictment and how it impacted, if at all, upon the jury’s consideration of the first count. It was at least misleading to allow it to be suggested to the jury that the evidence was relevant to show that the complainant had always been consistent in her versions or that early complaint after the incident alleged in the second count could demonstrate her consistency, when in fact no complaint had been forthcoming for over four years. 
      
       
     60 Late complaint is a matter that, generally speaking, adversely affects the credit of a complainant. True it is that s 107 of the Criminal Procedure Act has to some degree ameliorated the position by requiring a trial judge to alert the jury to the possibility that there may be reasons which explain the delay and to warn them that delay does not necessarily mean that the allegation is untrue. But a delay in complaint cannot be used to bolster the credibility of the complainant in respect of the allegation made in that complaint. Yet this is the impression that the passages in the summing up quoted above would have conveyed to the jury. 
      
       
     61 In order to avoid the error that is manifest in the summing up in the present case, it is important that a trial judge clearly appreciates the different purpose for which evidence is admitted under s 66(2), on the one hand, and under s 108(3), on the other. It is necessary to consider this distinction both at the time that leave is sought under s 108(3) and when formulating directions in respect of the evidence if it is admitted. It seems to me that it would be advisable for the parties and the trial judge to avoid referring to evidence admitted under s 108(3) as evidence of complaint in order to minimise the risk of any confusion arising as to the basis upon which evidence is admitted under that section with the purpose for the admission of evidence under s 66(2). 
      
       
     62 In my opinion this ground is made out and, notwithstanding that no request for a further direction or redirection was sought by defence counsel, this ground should be upheld. 
      
       
     63 The result of upholding Ground 3 is that the appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial directed. However, Ground 5 asserts that the convictions could not be supported by the evidence and, if this ground were made out, the proper result would be an order of acquittal. 
      
       
     64 The basis upon which this Court determines whether such a ground has been established are well settled. This Court is required to consider for itself the evidence in the trial and determine whether the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt that the Crown had proved the charges on the indictment. If there is a reasonable possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, this Court must intervene. 
      
       
     65 Counsel for the appellant has set out in his written submissions a large number of, what are said to be, instances of confusion and inconsistency in the complainant's evidence which ought to have given rise to a reasonable doubt in the collective mind of the jury. While it cannot be gainsaid that there were inconsistencies in the complainant's account of the occasions upon which she alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant, those matters do not by themselves persuade me that the jury ought not to have accepted the complainant’s version as generally honest and reliable. 
      
       
     66 One matter of significance in this particular case was the evidence of Dr Packer as to the state of the complainant's genitalia when examined by her on 31 October 2000. It should be remembered that the defence before the jury was that the complainant had concocted these allegations at the instigation of the mother who wished to discredit the appellant in order to obtain custody of the other child, Mickayla. 
      
       
     67 The fact that the complainant had been subjected to repeated acts sexual intercourse over a lengthy period of time was clearly a very relevant factor for the jury to consider when evaluating the complainant’s evidence, even though it did not itself support her allegation that the person responsible was the appellant. It was for the jury to consider the probability or improbability that the complainant would falsely accuse the appellant of that behaviour whatever might be her motive to do so. It was not the more usual case where the issue is whether the complainant has fabricated her allegation of sexual abuse. Nor was there any issue that the complainant could have been mistaken about who was responsible: she had to be falsely implicating the appellant as the person who had repeatedly engaged in intercourse with her. 
      
       
     68 Much of the criticism of the complainant’s evidence during the hearing of the appeal was concerned with the details of her account as to when she said that assaults other than those charged occurred, and the greater part of this criticism related to her evidence as to where the various assaults had taken place. The complainant, however, was not shown to be unreliable in her account of the two incidents that gave rise to the counts in the indictment, except in details which the jury would be entitled to consider were not matters of particular significance such as to undermine her credibility. These inconsistencies were, firstly, that she believed that Mickayla was in the house on the occasion giving rise to the first count, yet the uncontradicted evidence was that she had not been born when the complainant was living at Wyong and, secondly, that on one occasion she said that the conduct occurred in her bedroom rather than in the appellant’s bedroom. There was also the inconsistency in her allegations at trial with the history given to Dr Packer, although Dr Packer explained why that might have occurred and yet the complainant be reliable in her later allegations. 
      
       
     69 I am not to be taken as suggesting that inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence generally were not important matters for the jury to take into account in assessing her reliability. But the significant matter for the jury to determine was whether she was honest in relation to her allegation that the appellant had intercourse with her on the two occasions that were charged as offences. 
      
       
     70 In this regard a further basis upon which it was submitted that the convictions were unsafe was the lack of particularity in the two counts on the indictment so as to identify precisely the occasion that was the subject of each count. Counsel for the appellant relied upon S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 to support this submission. It was argued that the incident giving rise to the first count could not be distinguished from those unidentified and uncharged allegations which were relied upon as part of the relationship between the complainant and the appellant. It was submitted that, without further particulars being provided, the appellant could not defend himself. 
      
       
     71 No application was made for a stay of the indictment before the trial judge. Nor were any further particulars sought as to the incidents which gave rise to the two counts in the indictment. The appellant was prepared to go to trial on these matters simply on the basis that the allegations were fabricated at a time shortly before the police were informed of them. There was no suggestion that he was embarrassed in conducting that defence or in meeting the Crown case by reason of the nature of the charges. The complainant alleged that the two occasions were the first and last occasions when sexual intercourse occurred. There could, thus, be no difficulty identifying the particular occasions charged in the indictment if the question of autrefois convict or acquit arose. Nor was there any difficulty in understanding that the evidence of uncharged acts went to the relationship between the complainant and the appellant between the occasions to which the two counts related. The situation was, therefore, unlike that which confronted the accused in S v The Queen. Although some criticism has been made of the practice of particularising a charge by reference to it being the first or last act in a history of sexual abuse, see R v Baker; ex parte AG(Qld) [2002] 1 Qd R 274, in the present case there was sufficient particularity of the charges to allow the appellant to receive a fair trial. I am confirmed in this view by the absence of any complaint about the form of the indictment either before or during the trial. The only significance of the nature of the charges and the generality of the relationship evidence when considering the fairness of the appellant’s trial is the failure of the trial judge to warn the jury about the effects of delay in this regard. 
      
       
     72 I am not persuaded that this ground has been made out. Therefore, I proposed that the appeal be allowed, the convictions and sentences be quashed and there be an order for a new trial.

     2 STUDDERT J: I agree with Dunford J. 
      
       
     3 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Robert William Glover against his conviction in the District Court at Coffs Harbour on 20 June 2001 on two counts of maliciously damage property by means of explosives contrary to s 195(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, which offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the concurrent sentences of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years imposed following such convictions. 
      
       
     4 At about 1am on 3 August 1996 there was a large explosion at 1 Duke Street, Coffs Harbour which caused substantial damage to the building at that site, which was owned by Harbans Singh Hayer and others, and to the contents of one of the offices within the building, which was occupied by the New South Wales Department of Community Services (DOCS); hence the two charges, one relating to the building and one relating to the office of DOCS. DOCS suffered the majority of the damage caused by the explosion as the explosive device was placed on the footpath immediately outside its offices.  
      
       
     5 There was evidence that for some time prior to that date the appellant, who had become the sole carer for the children of his marriage following his wife’s death from cancer, was having difficulty with a number of his children, particularly his young son, Timothy, then aged about 10 who it was said suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, was engaged in antisocial behaviour, frequently absenting himself from the family home overnight and at times for several days at a time. 
      
       
     6 There was evidence that the appellant sought assistance from DOCS who referred him to the police, and when he approached the police they indicated that it was rather a matter for DOCS. There was evidence from Constable Simpson a member of the Police Bomb Disposal Unit who found debris which included red detonating cord (“Redcord”), and wrapping from a Power Gel Magnum 365 explosive cartridge, and a search of the appellant’s premises disclosed explosives and other related items along with documentation regarding the appellant’s expertise with explosives. There was also evidence that between November 1994 and 18 March 1996 the appellant purchased over 200 sticks of Power Gel along with Redcord and other associated products, although only about 17 sticks of this was Power Gel Magnum 365. The appellant had a special open permit to purchase explosives, and had done a TAFE course on the use of explosives, including the use of Power Gel.  
      
       
     7 Officers from DOCS gave evidence that from about late 1995 the appellant was having problems in relation to the care of his son, Timothy, but the Department’s attitude was that Timothy did not suffer from social problems, but rather from a medical condition being Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, about which DOCS could not assist.  
      
       
     8 On 2 August the appellant rang Mr Tomkinson, one of the officers, about his son being missing, and he was agitated and tense. During a second phone call that day the appellant became angry and irrational when Mr Tomkinson told him to call the police. On the same day he telephoned an electoral officer for the local member of Parliament, whose office was located in the same building, and during the conversation he angrily blamed DOCS for his family problems, particularly with his son and older daughter.  
      
       
     9 That same day Anthony White, the Manager of the Burnside Family Centre, received a call from the appellant who was angry and upset about his missing son and the fact that DOCS would not do anything about it. The appellant said, “Do I have to do what that bloke did at Port Arthur before anyone will take any notice?” In early to mid June 1996 he made a similar remark to Sergeant Ian Hodges when he attended Coffs Harbour Police Station to report his son missing. 
      
       
     10 There was expert evidence as to how the explosive device using Power Gel Magnum and Redcord could be detonated and the amount of explosives needed to cause an explosion such as the subject one.  
      
       
     11 A duly authorised listening device recorded the appellant saying that he was away from home at the time of his explosion, and a neighbour (Ms Carol Ginn) gave evidence that she heard a car drive out of the appellant’s driveway shortly before she heard an explosion and return shortly afterwards. Also on 7 August she had a conversation with the appellant where he indicated that he was not at home at the time of the explosion because he was out looking for his son.  
      
       
     12 His daughter, Melanie Glover said that she came home on the night of 2/3 August 1996 at about midnight, hers was the only car at the house, she went to sleep and did not awake until morning when she noticed her car was parked in a different location to the previous night  
      
       
     13 There was also evidence that the accused had approached two federal agents and offered to act as an informer but said he wanted immunity from the explosion at the DOCS’ office.  
      
       
     14 The appellant did not give evidence, but in a recorded interview he denied any involvement in the offence and later he told his neighbour that he had gone out looking for his son on the night of 2 August 1996 but returned by 11pm and had not gone out again.  
      
       
     15 Although he did not give evidence, the appellant called a number of witnesses, including another daughter who said that on the night of 2 August she was in her bedroom where she could hear cars come and go, but did not hear a car leave after Melanie came home. She also said that in the morning before Melanie awoke the appellant used Melanie’s car to get bread, and that Timothy was at home all that evening.  
      
       
     16 The appellant also called an explosives consultant who expressed opinions somewhat at variance with the Crown experts as to the amount of Power Gel and Redcord needed to cause the explosion.  
      
       
     17 In cross-examination, the police and DOCS’ employees gave evidence of a large number of other people who were investigated by police, including some who had threatened to blow up DOCS’ or harm employees or had access to Power Gel Magnum 365.  
      
       
     18 A number of grounds of appeal were relied on.  
      
       
     19 Ground 1 (as amended at the hearing): 
      
       
       The trial judge erred in his directions regarding circumstantial evidence in that he did not direct that the jury need be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of evidence, to the effect that the appellant: 
        
       (a) had the capacity or expertise to commit the alleged offences, 
        
       (b) had the opportunity to commit the alleged offences, 
        
       (c) had lied, 
        
       (d) that it was Power Gel 365 that was the explosive used. 
        
       
     20 In his Summing-Up his Honour said (SU 17) that the Crown set out to prove a number of circumstances, that is facts and events which the Crown said, when taken together, proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty because there was no other reasonable explanation. He then gave the usual direction as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “However, before you can find an accused person guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable, but that it is the only reasonable finding to make. It follows, that if there is some other finding which is reasonably open, that is there is another reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence, then it is your duty to acquit him, to find him not guilty. Of course when you consider circumstantial evidence you do so in light of all the material in the case including, of course, material placed before you by the accused. … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It seems to me that there are four circumstances, basically, upon which the Crown relies, plus the element of lies, which I will deal with separately. One of those circumstances, I believe, requires that you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of its existence, because it is a link, an indispensable link, in the chain of reasoning which the Crown presents to you. The other circumstances, are, or could be, likened to strands in a rope – the more strands there are, and the thicker the individual strands are, then, consequently, the thicker and stronger is the rope. You need to be in a situation, as the Crown described, where you look at the whole picture, look at everything together – you do not look at the circumstances in isolation and say “Well that circumstance by itself wouldn’t prove his guilt”, you look at the whole picture and each of the circumstances can gain strength from their association with the others in the picture. Except, as I say, for one, which seems to me to be an indispensable link.” 
         
        
       
     21 He then identified the circumstances relied on, one of which he divided into two parts so that, including the lies, there were in effect six circumstances identified for the jury, namely 
      
       
        
        (1) that the appellant had a grudge against DOCS;  
         
        (2) that he had the personal capacity, that is sufficient expertise to produce the explosion; 
         
        (3) that he had access to the type of explosives which were used in the device and in sufficient quantity to produce the result; 
         
        (4) that he had the opportunity, that he was able to go there and set off the explosion; 
         
        (5) the exclusion of other possible suspects; and  
         
        (6) that the appellant lied to police about whether he left home on the night in question.  
        
       
     22 His Honour said that item number 3 (access to sufficient explosives of the type involved) was an essential immediate step which had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but the effect of his Summing-Up was that the other matters did not need to be proved beyond reasonable doubt provided that the cumulative effect was such as to exclude any conclusion other than that the accused was guilty.  
      
       
     23 The appellant relied on what was said by Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 579 where his Honour, after dealing with the nature of circumstantial evidence and saying that it is not the law that an inference of guilt from such evidence can properly be drawn only from facts which have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, went on to say:- 
      
       
        
         
         “On the other hand, it may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where - to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore on Evidence, vol.9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par.2497, pp 412-414 – the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     24 In the present case, the ability or capacity of the appellant to make the explosive device does not appear to have seriously been in issue. As his Honour told the Jury (SU 28-9): 
      
       
        
         
         “The other part of the circumstance of his capacity, namely that he had the requisite level of expertise, is not, I think in serious dispute. You know that he was licensed in a number of ways to manufacture, to explode, to transport explosives and so on, and he had the requisite tickets as a result of having completed the TAFE course, the TAFE course which was taught by Mr Green, whoever it was, the gentleman that wanted to reassure us that he was not there and had not done it - you will remember him, he described the accused as being a student who achieved 97.4% and he was the one who produced copies of the documents that the accused would have had access to in the course of that learning dealing with Redcord and PowerGel and so on. And the accused in his record of interview, and indeed in the discussions that you hear on the listening device tapes, makes no secret of the fact that he had an interest in explosives, and an interest in devising ways of using them, of improvising and so on.”  
         
        
       
     25 Of course the capacity of any accused person to commit a crime may be a self-evident fact. As Dawson J pointed out in Shepherd at 581 it may often be unnecessary to identify an intermediate fact if it is obvious to the jury. I would regard the technical capacity of the appellant to set up the explosion as such an obvious fact that it did not require identification as an intermediate fact requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     26 Similarly with the appellant’s opportunity to commit the offence. It would be obvious to any juror, as to any other mentally competent member of the community, that a person cannot commit an offence unless that person has the opportunity to do so and, like the capacity of the accused to commit the offence, opportunity is not (at least in the circumstances of this case) a circumstance which required a direction that it needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     27 It was the combination of a number of circumstances each proved on the balance of probabilities on which the Crown relied to establish beyond reasonable doubt the ultimate fact, namely, that it was the appellant who in fact set the explosion. Circumstances such as capacity and opportunity each taken alone may in a particular case, such as the present, only be proved on the balance of probabilities, but when taken together with a number of other circumstances similarly proved, may establish the guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt; see the example given by McHugh J in Shepherd at 592.  
      
       
     28 In the appellant’s written submissions reference was made to the fact that the Crown set out to prove that the appellant was absent from his home at the time of the explosion and went on, “If it is not proven beyond reasonable doubt it places the appellant at home at the relevant time and plainly innocent”. This does not follow. Evidence that he probably was absent from home does not establish that he was at home (it tends to establish the exact opposite).   
      
       
     29 There was in fact substantial evidence to the effect that the appellant was absent from his home at the relevant time. A neighbour (Carol Ginn) gave evidence of hearing a car leave the appellant’s premises about a quarter of an hour before, and return about a quarter of an hour after, the explosion on 7 August 1996. The appellant told her that he was not at home at the time of the explosion “because he was out looking for his son” and one of his daughters, Melanie, said she returned home in her car at about midnight and went to sleep, but the following morning found her car parked in a different location.  
      
       
     30 The direction given by his Honour in relation to the telling of lies was in accordance with the majority judgment of the High Court in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 209-11, but it was submitted that as the alleged lie related to the opportunity to commit the offence it needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, as already pointed out, whether he had the opportunity to commit the offence is a matter which the jury would have regarded as essential in any event and whether he lied about it, whilst a relevant circumstance, was not an essential intermediate step.  
      
       
     31 By an amendment to the grounds of appeal made orally at the hearing of the appeal it was further submitted that another “intermediate fact” which required proof beyond reasonable doubt was that it was Power Gel 365 that was the explosive used. 
      
       
     32 This proposition (that Power Gel 365 was the explosive used) was inextricably bound up with the proposition which his Honour directed the Jury did require proof beyond reasonable doubt, namely that he had access to the right sort of explosive and in sufficient quantity, and in my view is indistinguishable from it. In this regard, his Honour directed the Jury as follows (at SU 20):- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown suggested to you that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this damage at the Department of Community Services building was the result of an explosion of two different types of explosive, they being Powergel Magnum 365 and Redcord, and it may be that you are already persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that those were the two elements which went to make up this device. There has certainly been a lot of evidence, and I do not understand any of that evidence to have really sought to controvert the proposition, that that is what was involved.” 
         
        
       
     33 In the present case it was the cumulative effect of the appellant’s motive, his ability or capacity to make the explosive device, access by him to sufficient explosives of the kind used to make the device, the opportunity to be at the scene and the exclusion of other possible suspects, together with the lies, on which the Crown relied. In my view, none of these circumstances, not even the access to sufficient explosives, needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt; it was the inference of guilt arising from the combination and totality of the circumstances which needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and none of them individually constituted an essential intermediate step within the terms of Shepherd. 
      
       
     34 Ground 2  
      
       
       The trial judge erred in admitting evidence to the effect that the appellant had sought immunity from prosecution in respect of the alleged offences in conversation with Federal Police on 19 July 1999.  
        
       
     35 The appellant approached federal police officers on 19 July 1999 and offered information relating to criminal activity in Coffs Harbour in the role of police informer. The officers to whom he spoke, agents Johnson and Meehan, gave evidence that in the course of that conversation he said, “All I’m asking from you is immunity from prosecution basically …”, and later, “now for you to get credibility from your boss … I want immunity from the explosion at the DOCS office …”. The appellant had previously acted in the role of police informer with state police in 1998. 
      
       
     36 It was submitted that the evidence should not have been admitted for three reasons:  
      
       
       1) its probative value was low given in the context of trying to boost the appellant’s credibility with police officers in the role of an informer, whereas its prejudicial value was high given that the prosecution relied on it as the only confession of guilt by the appellant amidst his consistent denials otherwise; and accordingly it should have been excluded pursuant to ss 135 and 137 of the  
       Evidence Act 1995 
       ,  
        
       (2) at common law the statements of informers have always been treated with caution and may be “unreliable evidence”, and reference was made to s 165 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       , and as an informer is likely to have a hidden agenda prompting the giving of information to authorities, the probative value of any statement made by an informer is reduced, and accordingly ss 135 and 137 were again relevant, and  
        
       (3) the appellant’s statements to police in his role of informer were entitled to be treated in confidence, akin to public interest immunity, and reference was made to  
       The Attorney General of NSW v Stewart 
        (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 674-6.  
        
       
     37 In my view none of these submissions are valid. The statements made to the police were capable of being regarded by the jury as admissions by him that he was responsible for, or involved in, the explosion at the DOCS office. He may have denied his involvement at other times, but this is irrelevant, because not only did he make what could be regarded as an admission, but he was offering to give information to the federal police in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a clear acknowledgment, I would have thought, that he had something to fear from a prosecution. He was not trapped or led into the alleged admission: he approached the federal police and he volunteered the request for immunity in exchange for the giving of information. In my opinion this request for immunity was highly probative, it certainly was prejudicial to the appellant, but such prejudice was not unfair to him, and accordingly ss 135 and 137 had no application.  
      
       
     38 It is true that evidence by informers has often been regarded as unreliable, and the evidence which he was offering to give, and apparently did give, to the police officers about the criminal activities of others may have been unreliable; but that did not affect the reliability of any alleged admission made by him concerning his own involvement in criminal activity, and once again ss 135 and 137 are of no application.  
      
       
     39 The law regards the evidence of informers as possibly unreliable because of its experience over time that they may falsely inform on others in the expectation of receiving some benefit for themselves; but here the appellant was not informing on some third party, but on himself, so the law’s experience of the unreliability of information provided by informers relating to the activity of others was not relevant. 
      
       
     40 The public interest immunity referred to in Attorney General of NSW v Stewart relates to the identity of an informer providing information about the criminal activities of others; its rationale is that if the identity of the informer were liable to be disclosed, sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting criminal activity, ongoing enquiries may be jeopardised and the informer may be at risk of danger from the criminals informed on. None of these considerations applied here, and consequently there was no public interest in protecting the appellant’s identity in respect of an alleged admission relating to his own criminal activities.  
      
       
     41 Ground 3 
      
       
       The trial miscarried by reason of the introduction into evidence of the evidence by David Andrew Johnston (and related evidence) to the effect that during 1998 the appellant had provided information to (State) police which was  
       “malicious in regard to certain persons” 
       . 
        
       
     42 Evidence was led by the Crown from David Andrew Johnston, a New South Wales police officer, to the effect that the appellant was a registered informer for the State police in 1998 and was discharged from that registration in July of that year, in effect after giving unreliable information. In particular Detective Johnston said that some of the information, upon research, was malicious in regard to certain persons and that the appellant was only supplying the police with half-truths. Defence counsel did not object to this evidence but cross-examined on it, including asking the question at T 690: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now if he were such a dud, why did you pass him on to the Federal Police on 1 July 1998?”  
         
        
       
     43 Johnston’s answer was to the effect that he was not passed on but was introduced to Federal Police because he wished to give information relating to hash (sic), a subject with which federal agent Johnson had more knowledge and expertise. It was submitted that the evidence was not relevant, that it was unreliable and of poor quality, that it was tendency evidence which did not comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act in relation to such evidence and that it improperly raised the issue of character. 
      
       
     44 In fact the issue of the appellant being a police informant had first been raised by the defence, early in the trial, in cross-examination of Senior Constable Bell. This matter having been raised by the defence, it was open to the Crown to establish, as it did in re-examination of Sen. Cons. Bell, that it was only after the explosion of the DOCS’ office that the appellant became a State police informant. It was in that context that Detective Johnston gave the evidence objected to.  
      
       
     45 The evidence was not objected to by defence counsel who pursued the matter further by cross-examining on it. There was at no stage any request of the trial judge to take the evidence from the jury nor to discharge the jury, nor were any judicial directions sought in relation to it. Moreover, the Crown did not take the matter beyond the quality of the information, evidence as to character was not led, and the evidence in no way related to any alleged tendency on the part of the appellant to cause explosions. 
      
       
     46 As conceded by the appellant’s counsel in his Written Submissions, there could have been tactical reasons for defence counsel at trial not to object to the evidence, and indeed to raise the issue of the appellant being a police informant in the first place, and to cross-examine Det Johnston in relation to it. No objection was taken and accordingly Rule 4 applies, and as the point is without substance, I would not grant leave to raise it.  
      
       
     47 Furthermore, the evidence may not have been without some significance. It was only after the explosion that the appellant offered himself as an informant to the State Police, but he was discharged as such informer in July 1998. That could explain why he went to the Federal Police when he wanted to ask for immunity from prosecution for this explosion; it could be expected that the State Police would not listen to him, so it could put his request for immunity into context and explain why he went to the Federal rather than the State police with such a request. 
      
       
     48 Ground 4 (added at the hearing) 
      
       
       His Honour was in error in not excluding the evidence of the results of the search warrant executed at the appellant’s premises. 
         
        
       
     49 It was submitted that there was an error in the application for the search warrant which stated that the applicant had purchased explosives in November 1995, whereas in November 1995 he had only been issued with a licence to purchase explosives, although there was evidence that he had later actually purchased such explosives; furthermore, the appellant was not present during the whole of the search of the premises, particularly the search of the shed where some of the explosives were located; and thirdly, that no video was taken of the search, but only still photos, and such photos of the bedroom where there was a toolbox containing explosives were taken after the original police had moved things around. It was submitted that for the police officer to juxtapose the Redcord and the detonators damaged the appellant’s case because he had been keeping them in separate places for safety purposes. 
      
       
     50 It was not suggested that the appellant did not have the relevant explosive materials at his premises at the time of the search, but even if they were kept in separate locations, it was open to him to join them together to create the explosion. The evidence was not objected to at the trial and Rule 4 applies. In the circumstances I would not give leave to argue the point. 
      
       
     51 For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the convictions. 
      
       
     52 Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence 
      
       
       The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the concurrent sentences imposed on him, on the following grounds: 
        
       (a) The penalty is too close to the statutory maximum given the slight criminal antecedents of the appellant; 
        
       (b) The penalty did not sufficiently reflect the subjective circumstances of the appellant; 
        
       (c) The sentencing judge took into account matters extraneous to the counts in the indictment in considering the risk of injury to persons. 
        
       
     53 To deal with the last point first. In sentencing the applicant, his Honour took into account the potential risk of physical injury to other persons, particularly the next door neighbour, Mrs Young, an elderly lady who was, as it happens, looking out of her window trying to ascertain the origin of the sizzling sound she heard just before the explosion, and other persons who may have been walking past in the street following the closure of the nearby RSL Club sometime earlier. It was submitted that by having regard to these matters the sentencing judge acted contrary to the principles laid down in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 to the effect that a judge cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.  
      
       
     54 The appellant’s difficulty however is that the circumstances of aggravation, which his Honour took into account, namely the potential physical injury to other persons, would not have in the present case warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.  
      
       
     55 Counsel for the appellant referred us to ss 46, 47 and 48 of the Crimes Act but those sections either require actual injury (s 46) or intent to injure (ss 47 and 48) and his Honour did not sentence on the basis of any actual injury or intent to injure other persons; accordingly he was not taking into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.  
      
       
     56 Furthermore, our attention was drawn to the second reading speech of the then Attorney General when introducing the Crimes (Criminal Destruction and Damage) Amendment Act 1997, which enacted s 195(b) in its present form. The Attorney said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         A maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment is provided as the potential harm is increased by the use of fire or explosion. For this offence it is not necessary that there be an intent to defraud or injure as is the present requirement for certain arson offences. It is sufficient that damage was caused by the use of fire or explosives.”  
         Hansard 
         , Legislative Assembly, 28 October 1987 at 15,344-5 
         . 
         
        
       
     57 The use of the words “potential harm” as opposed to “damage” strongly suggests that the Attorney was referring to potential risk to other persons.  
      
       
       The local RSL Club, which closed at 1am, was only a block away, and there were people moving around in the area. 
        
       
     58 The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. As both offences arose out of the one explosion his Honour quite properly made the sentences wholly concurrent, and fixed the penalty at 80% of the maximum. It was submitted that this was too high for a first offender or for an offence which was not the worst type of that offence. However, the offences were serious, it is an abhorrent crime, bordering on terrorism and as his Honour said, it was totally unacceptable and antisocial, involving as it did not only the destruction of the building and the potential risk of physical injury to other persons, but substantial damage and inconvenience to the officers of a government department rendering it less able to deal with other clients who may be seeking its assistance.  
      
       
     59 In addition, consistently with the appellant’s pleas of not guilty, there was an absence of any contrition and there was no evidence of a psychiatric condition. The serious offence called for severe punishment to demonstrate the community’s condemnation of the conduct, as well as retribution and general deterrence.  
      
       
     60 True it is that the appellant had been under a lot of pressure, which his Honour acknowledged, by the death of his wife, the disintegration of his family, the particular problems with his youngest son, and the difficulties and frustration which he encountered in seeking help from the department which he felt should have been able to assist him. He was aged 48 years and had led a generally law abiding life with only one previous conviction for assault in 1992 for which he had been placed on a recognisance. 
      
       
     61 Having regard to all these factors, I am not persuaded that the sentence of 8 years is excessive, but having regard to his age, that this is his first time in prison, that he is unlikely to offend again in this manner and the other subjective features, I am satisfied that the non-parole period is excessive and his Honour should have found that these matters together constituted special circumstances. 
      
       
     62 Since the hearing of this appeal we have, with the consent of the Crown, received further affidavit evidence to the effect that the appellant is since 12 May 2002 serving his sentence on protection together with a submission asking the Court to take into account the harsher nature of imprisonment on protection. 
      
       
     63 I have considered this additional material, but having regard to the objective gravity of the offences, I do not consider that either the head sentence or the non-parole period should be reduced below what I am about to indicate. 
      
       
     64 I therefore propose the following orders:- 
      
       
       1. Appeal against convictions dismissed, convictions affirmed. 
        
       2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       3. Allow the appeal. 
        
       4. Confirm the head sentences. 
        
       5. Quash the non-parole period and in lieu thereof fix a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 4 December 2000 and to expire 3 December 2005.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 10 April 2002, Michael Kanaan, Rabeeh Mawas and Wassim El Assaad were each placed on trial for the murder of Danny Karam. By their verdict, returned on 6 June 2002, the jury found each of them guilty of that offence. They now appear for sentence. 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
      
    2 Danny Karam was, prior to his death, a vicious and notorious member of the Sydney underworld, who for many years had supervised a protection racket in the Kings Cross area, whereby he exacted, through force and threat, payments from dealers in narcotics. He had allegedly acquired his skills in violence and terror while a member of a militia in the Lebanon.  
     
      
    3 Through his activities, certain drug dealers who operated on the Streets of Kings Cross were effectively licensed by him to ply their trade. In return for payments of up to $4000 per week they were allowed to operate, and to receive protection from the rival gangs which were organised by members of the other criminal associations who regrettably have managed to continue their operations in the area. Not surprisingly their continued, and wholly unjustifiable presence in the life of this City, has led to rivalries and outbursts of inter gang violence, and facilitated the ready availability of cocaine and other narcotics.4 During the course of the trial, evidence was led in relation to some of the incidents of violence associated with these groups, including disputes with Russell Townsend, the Ibrahim brothers and henchmen such as Tongan Sam, with whom Karam was in a territorial conflict at the time of his death. The appearance of these individuals in the trial, and some exploration of their activities, became necessary in view of the defence case that one or other of them was in fact responsible for the murder of Danny Karam, rather than those before the Court.5 In that regard, apart from the ongoing turf war, and occasional bashings of runners allied to rival gangs, there was evidence that Karam’s shooting occurred on the first anniversary of the kneecapping of Danny Sukkar for which Karam and Alex Taouil were said to have been responsible.6 Be that as it may, the verdict of the jury was largely based upon the evidence of three witnesses, one of whom, known by the pseudonym Alan Rossini, was an inner member of Karam’s gang, a group which was given the tag “DK’s Boys”. The other two, who were provided with the pseudonyms Oscar and Peter Laycock, and who were cousins of Rossini, were bit players who were used to run messages, to collect moneys and to deliver drugs to the runners.7 By the time of Karam’s murder on 13 December 1998, Kanaan was effectively his senior lieutenant, although through a blood relationship, Karam was probably more dependant upon another associate, Alex Taouil. Mawas, El Assaad, and another man Charlie Gea Gea were more recent additions, but together with Kanaan they controlled a slice of the drug dealing territory themselves, in so far as they had their own runners and paid a licensing fee to Karam.8 Karam was not only the controller of a protection operation, but he similarly organised the supply and delivery of drugs, mainly cocaine but also heroin, within the city.9 In all, the operation was significant and it is of very real concern that it was able to operate as long as it did, in an organised and open way with tentacles spreading into the drug distribution business of this city, with a capacity to assemble an arsenal of fire arms of some size, and a willingness to use them as required. To maintain the supply of drugs it established drug houses in various locations, including Rushcutters Bay, Paddington and elsewhere, where drugs were stored, deals were capped, and “rent moneys” were taken. Runners were engaged, weapons were issued by Karam, mobile phones and SIM cards were obtained in false names, and regularly exchanged, and large sums of cash and drugs were moved around. Viewed in hindsight, it was an utterly surreal world into which the prisoners became drawn, and in which they surrendered any personal values they had. 10 By the time of Karam’s murder, the group had established a safe house in the Addison apartment building, on the corner of Riley and Fitzroy Streets, Surry Hills. These premises, like the others, were used for the capping of cocaine and as an assembly place for gang members, whose permanent places of residence were elsewhere. It was at these premises that Kanaan, El Assaad, Gea Gea and Mawas met and plotted the murder of their boss, Karam, during the months preceding his shooting. 
     
      
    11 For part of that time, however, it needs to be recognised that Mawas was out of the country. It also needs to be said that the idea of killing Karam emanated from Kanaan and that when first raised Mawas said that it was not necessary, and that they could do other things on the side.12 Although Rossini said that he was not directly involved in the plot to kill Karam, he became aware, through his presence at the unit, as to what was being discussed. He explained that various scenarios were considered including shooting Karam as he returned to his home, a plan that was abandoned when it was realised that this might attract attention to themselves, since his place of residence was not widely known. Another plan to kill him with a hot shot of heroin came unstuck when he became suspicious that heroin supplied to him via Gea Gea had been spiked.13 Finally it was decided that he would be shot, when the occasion conveniently arose, during one of his visits to the Riley Street safe house. For that purpose the prisoners, Gea Gea, and Rossini spent a number of nights at the unit waiting for his arrival. Each had access to a weapon, and weapons were kept at the unit, concealed behind a dishwasher in the kitchen.14 Rossini attributed the reason for the decision to betray and to assassinate their leader, to dissatisfaction as to the share of the moneys which they were receiving for their efforts in running Karam’s protection racket and their own drug dealing activities. It was their view, Rossini said, that Karam was receiving the lions share for little effort other than the occasional stroll through Kings Cross, to show that he was still around, thereby trading on his reputation. Additionally, it was said that they were getting tired of the way in which he was treating them, relating in particular to the outbursts of violence and abuse for which he was well known.15 In Kanaan’s case, Rossini additionally suggested that there was some residual resentment relating to Karam’s diversion to himself of the proceeds of an earlier hydroponic crop of cannabis for which he and Rossini had carried out all the work, and to Karam’s refusal to repay a loan which had been made to him by Kanaan’s parents.16 The opportunity for which they were waiting came on the night of 13 December 1998, when Karam arrived at the unit for the purpose of collecting two weapons, an assault rifle and a shotgun, which had been stored there. Quite what was in his mind is unclear, although it emerged that he had been discussing some venture with another associate in the criminal milieu, George Cheikh, the details of which he was unwilling to share with his own boys.17 When it was learned that he had buzzed the security intercom system at the front door, Kanaan, Mawas, and Gea Gea hastily armed themselves with weapons and left via the stairs to the underground car park. They commandeered a motor vehicle which had been parked there by the Laycock brothers, who were engaged in moving items from Riley Street to a newly acquired safe house in the Peak apartment building in Chinatown.18 They exited the building and left the vehicle in Little Riley Street, possibly intending to use it as a getaway vehicle. Whatever their purpose, they then took up positions in the street, waiting for Karam’s return.19 Karam entered the unit, and spent some little time there chatting with Rossini, and with El Assaad who had left with the other men but had then returned. They were joined by the Laycocks, who had come back to the unit after their vehicle was taken, and possibly by one or two other associates who called in for a brief period. While there, Karam arranged for the Laycocks to take the two weapons which he had come to collect, down to his Toyota Rav vehicle which he had parked in Fitzroy Street. 20 Having done this, the two Laycocks made themselves scarce by retiring to the front bedroom, where they lay on the beds. When Karam left the unit to return to his vehicle, El Assaad used a mobile phone, at about 8.59 pm, to send a message to the waiting gunmen in the street. As Karam re-entered his vehicle and sat in the drivers seat, they emerged from behind. A volley of shots in two bursts was heard and seen by a number of residents of the Addison apartments and nearby buildings. Although not all of the accounts of these witnesses was identical, there was a common thread to the effect that more than one man fired shots into the nearside of the vehicle from close proximity, and that after walking away, one man returned and fired some more shots into the drivers side window.21 Forensic examination of the scene and of damage to the vehicle, as well as a post mortem examination of Karam’s body, showed that 16 shots had been fired, 5 from a weapon of .45 calibre, 5 from a weapon of .357 or .38 calibre, and 6 from a weapon of 9 mm calibre. The ballistics evidence showed that in each instance the shots were fired by a single weapon of the relevant calibre. 22 It was accordingly accepted that three weapons were used in the shooting, and consistently with that, a number of the eyewitnesses reported seeing three men running from the scene.  
     
      
    23 Rossini and the Laycock brothers, along with El Assaad, made their way down to the Toyota after the shooting and found Karam sprawled across the front seat, obviously dead.24 El Assaad opened the car door and took Karam’s mobile phone. Thereafter the four men left the area, in two separate groups, meeting up later at Kensington. The Laycocks were however sent back to Riley Street to retrieve a .357 calibre revolver which El Assaad had left in the unit. It had not been used in the shooting, but it was removed no doubt out of concern that the apartment would be searched by police, as in fact occurred the next day.25 Of the weapons used in the shooting only one was ever recovered by Police. This was a .45 calibre weapon which Karam had issued to Rossini, and which was abandoned by him during a later incident and then found by police. It was matched by ballistics evidence to one of the weapons used in the shooting of Karam.26 Not surprisingly, police were faced with a formidable task in identifying the killers, given Karam’s reputation and the number of people, of similarly violent criminal disposition, with whom he had come into holts. There were as many potential suspects as he had enemies. However through the efforts of the Crime Commission of NSW, Rossini and the Laycocks were secured as material witnesses, and then given undertakings in order to allow them to give evidence to the effect of that which I have summarised. That evidence included admissions which Rossini attributed to each of Kanaan and Mawas of having themselves shot Karam. In the case of El Assaad, whose criminality related to having acted as the person who alerted the shooters to Karam’s imminent arrival on the street, at a time when he was party to a joint criminal enterprise to murder, Rossini’s account involved direct evidence of hearing him place the telephone call. 27 There were inconsistencies in the details of the accounts which Rossini and the Laycocks had given over the several interviews, and court hearings in which they have individually participated, as well as some differences in detail between each other. However, the common thread of the evidence as to that which occurred was consistent. It was accepted by the jury, whose verdict I must also accept.28 Such inconsistencies or differences which occurred, I have little doubt, attached to the inevitable progressive disclosure which occurs in a situation such as the present, particularly where the witnesses here were finding their way and were also endeavouring, so far as they could, to minimise any problem for their relatives. Additionally it was due, I am satisfied, to the inevitable differences in observation and recollection concerning the somewhat shocking events which unfolded, and to the fact that neither of the Laycock brothers who were quite young, appeared to be endowed with any great intelligence or awareness of what they had let themselves into.29 As a result of the inquiries of the Crime Commission, Kanaan, Mawas and El Assaad were all arrested on 17 September 1999 and charged with Karam’s murder. Gea Gea left Australia for the Lebanon on 22 May 1999, and has not returned. It has not been possible to secure his extradition, and it is unlikely that he will see fit to return to Australia.30 The prisoners have each been held in custody since the time of their arrest, although they have also been serving time for other offences for which they have been sentenced. To the details of any pre sentence custody I will return when I come to consider the question of totality and the proper commencement date for the sentences of imprisonment which are clearly called for, in relation to the present offence.31 I find that this was a deliberate assassination which was carried out under Kanaan’s leadership, substantially in order to advance the interests of the prisoners in ongoing criminal activities. While it may not have had that result, it was motivated to a considerable degree by greed, and it was callous and cold blooded. While the prisoners are to be sentenced for the offence of murder, and not for any other criminal offences, it is impossible in assessing the objective criminality of this killing to ignore those wider circumstances, or the motive for it. The principal motive of Kanaan, and his recruitment of the others into his plan, I am satisfied, was to acquire an entrenched position for his subgroup in the trade of narcotics, and to increase their standing within that section of the criminal milieu which chooses to devote itself to that area of activity. A subsidiary motive was his sense of grievance at not being properly treated by Karam. 
     
      
    32 The fact that the offence was carried out in such a context, and involved the use of firearms, which appear to be regarded by many in the world of drug dealing as tools of the trade, was in my view, an aggravating circumstance.33 There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the prisoners killed Karam to escape from his evil spider web, or that they had any intention of abandoning the business of selling cocaine, and of exacting protection money from drug runners on the streets of Kings Cross. 34 In these circumstances, the objective criminality of each of Mawas and Kanaan, as shooters, and of El Assaad as a party to a joint enterprise to murder Karam, is of a very high order indeed.  
     
      
    35 Murder remains the most serious crime in the criminal calendar: R v Verney NSWCCA 23 March 1993, and the sanctity of human life is a principle which stands higher than all others in the criminal law: Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 341.36 No mitigation of the offence was provided by the fact that the killing was of a vicious criminal who was himself a danger to society. The community no more tolerates his killing than it did his criminal behaviour. Even less does it tolerate the notion of gangland shooting, whether internecine or otherwise. On the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that it was Karam who encouraged the prisoners, all young men in their early twenties, to enter this milieu, and who helped to blunt their sensibilities to the real world. 37 In a case such as the present the duty of the sentencing Court is clear – it must impose sentences that are significantly punitive, but even more importantly, sentences that send a clear deterrent message. If anyone wishes to behave in this fashion, and to engage in any form of gangland warfare, particularly the crime of murder, then such person can only expect a condign sentence. 
     
      
    38 If the level of culpability reaches that referred to in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as that section has been explained in Regina v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, then that sentence will be a mandatory life sentence. Whether such a sentence is called for in relation to the prisoners, I will consider when I come to deal with them individually.39 While the prisoners are not to be punished additionally for electing to go to trial, the fact that they did so speaks ill of whether or not they hold any feelings of remorse or contrition. Again I will deal with that when I come to consider their individual cases. Otherwise it may be observed that the election to go to trial denies to them the benefit of s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    40 At this stage, it is sufficient that I record my finding that each is to be sentenced upon the basis that this was a deliberate and cold blooded assassination carried out with considerable premeditation. By reference to the number of shots fired, the weapons used, and the proximity from which they were discharged, the only conclusion open is that this was a shooting carried out by the prisoners with an intent, and with a strong determination, to kill. That is itself a circumstance of some aggravation: Regina v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37. 
     
      
    41 It is true that at the time of the offence the three prisoners were each aged in their early twenties. However, the gravity and violence attaching to this offence, and their election to conduct themselves in the way that hardened criminals of more advanced years might do, cannot be relied upon by way of any significant diminution in their objective criminality for the reasons outlined in Regina v Townsend and Cooper NSWCCA 14 February 1995, Regina v Pham  (1991) 55 A Crim R 128; and Regina v Mastronardi [2000] NSWCCA 12. 42 I turn next to the circumstances of each offender, and to the sentences which I conclude should be imposed.  
     
      
      MICHAEL KANAAN 
      
    43 This offender presents as a considerable conundrum. Outwardly courteous, well spoken, and of apparent intelligence, he appears for sentence at a time when he is already serving a double life sentence for the fatal shooting, on 17 July 1998, of two young men while they were standing outside a hotel in Five Dock. As appears from the judgement of Greg James J, the sentencing Judge in that matter, Kanaan, while driving past the hotel came upon two persons having an altercation in the street. He made a remark to these persons which caused one of them to walk over to his car and to throw a punch at him. For no legitimate reason, Kanaan then left the vehicle and shot dead two persons who were standing on the footpath, and fired another shot at the man who had earlier walked over to him. Attempts to fire further shots at this man failed only because the weapon ran out of bullets. 44 His callous disregard for human life was encapsulated in the observation which he made to the passengers in his vehicle as he left the scene: “as long as we are all right, fuck everyone else. Fuck the Aussies, as long as we’re all right. If it happened again I would do the same thing…”. 45 Not surprisingly Justice Greg James found that Kanaan had “perpetrated an entirely vicious and cold-blooded series of crimes with overwhelming ruthlessness”, his response being disproportionate to a situation of very limited significance. This was regarded as falling within the worst case contemplated by the legislature as punishable by the maximum sentence. 46 Kanaan was in fact born on 23 May 1975, in Australia, to Lebanese parents, being one of four children who were nurtured in favourable circumstances. He is now aged 27 years. He left school after completing Year 12 and commenced tertiary studies in social sciences, completing two years of that course. He has had no significant employment history, his only stated lawful employment having been in a labouring capacity with a car auction firm.47 The first entry on his criminal record concerned charges of possession of a prohibited drug and of a prohibited article, for which, on appeal, a s 556A recognisance to be of good behaviour for 2 years was imposed in June 1998. He was also fined that year for common assault, in the Bankstown Local Court.  
     
      
    48 The next entries relate to the convictions for the 2 counts of murder, and the one count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, in respect of which he was sentenced by Justice Greg James to 2 life terms, and to a fixed term of imprisonment for 25 years. The offences which gave rise to those convictions preceded the present offence by approximately five months. He had been taken into custody on 1 June 1999 for another matter which is still outstanding, and the sentences imposed by Justice Greg James were backdated to 17 September 1999, being the date of arrest for those offences. 
     
      
    49 The present offence occurred while he was subject to a bond to be of good behaviour, and that is an aggravating circumstance. The offences which attracted the life sentences, and the sentence of 25 years imprisonment, also occurred during the currency of that bond. 50 Regrettably he has, by his behaviour, betrayed his background of a supportive family which gave him every opportunity of establishing a reasonable and law-abiding lifestyle. Why it is that he chose to descend into the criminal milieu, and to become a person who apparently kills without emotion or compunction, has not been explained. 51 Whatever be the underlying reason for this, he has shown himself by his past behaviour and by this offence to be a real danger to the community, to the point which attracts a consideration of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as well as a consideration of the principles referred to in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    52 The imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without opportunity for release on parole, in the case of a young man who is now aged only 27 years, has a terrible significance and it effectively crushes out all hope of rehabilitation, thereby giving rise to the concerns noted in R v Harris at para 124, and in Regina v Garforth NSWCCA 23 May 1994. However, the fact of the prior convictions, and the level of heinousness displayed by the prisoner in this case, in my view do not permit other than the maximum sentence of life imprisonment provided by s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
     
      
    53 That he should have killed again, in an equally cold blooded manner, within six months of the prior killings, places the interest of community protection at a premium.  
     
      
    54 Even without the earlier convictions, I would have been forced to the conclusion that this prisoner’s responsibility for, and his involvement in, the present killing, was one of the magnitude of extreme culpability of which s 61(1) speaks. In this regard it was he who introduced, and then relentlessly promoted the plan to kill Karam over many months. Without his leadership and encouragement, it is certain that the other prisoners would not have contemplated or embarked upon this shooting. While it does not involve the full flavour of a contract killing which saw Phuong Ngo imprisoned for life (R v Ngo [2001] NSWSC 1021), it is not entirely dissimilar from such a case. 
     
      
    55 What, in my view, takes this case into the s 61(1) category is the cold blooded nature of the prisoner’s conduct in promoting and carrying out Karam’s execution. If I am wrong in that assessment, then I have no doubt whatsoever that the accumulation of murders in which he has been directly involved, in each instance as a shooter, meets the s 61(1) criterion. 
     
      
    56 Michael Kanaan, for the murder of Danny Karam I sentence you to imprisonment for life, such sentence to commence from 17 September 1999. I do not fix a non parole period as I have no power to do so.  
     
      
      RABEEH MAWAS 
       
      
    57 The pre sentence report shows that Mawas was born on 1 March 1977, and is now aged 25 years. He was the eldest child in a family of 4 children born to Lebanese parents. When he was aged 16 years, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. As his father was a shift worker with State Rail, he took over the responsibility for the care and control of his younger siblings. The progression of his mother’s disease, and her death in 1996, led to a partial separation of the family when the youngest child was sent back to the Lebanon to be cared for by relatives.  
     
      
    58 As a consequence of these events, Mawas received counselling for the anger and grief associated with his mother’s illness and with the additional responsibilities which he had assumed. Following his mother’s death he was for a time suicidal and treated with medication. It was after this event that he began to use drugs, mainly cocaine and ecstasy, as a consequence of which his life began to unravel, eventually leading to him becoming an associate of Kanaan and Karam, although not to the point of being one of the preferred DK Boys who were entitled to a gold ring. 59 He reported to the Probation and Parole Service that he had tried two apprenticeships but had been unable to settle into any long term employment. Obviously his education was disrupted by the events within the family, and the subsequent further fragmentation within the family when his father and other siblings also returned to the Lebanon. 60 He first came into contact with the law in 1994, when he was fined in the Children’s Court for an offence of malicious damage. Since then he has received multiple convictions, in Local Courts and in the District Court, for motoring offences, some relatively minor and others which are more serious. The record which he has accumulated, since early 1997, while involving numerous entries, however is not particularly serious. Moreover in his favour, it is not one involving any incidents of violence.61 On 17 April 1997, he was fined, disqualified and ordered to perform 70 hours of community service following convictions for two counts of driving or using an unregistered vehicle, two counts of driving an uninsured vehicle, 1 count of driving while his licence was cancelled, one count of driving while disqualified, and one count of stating a false name and place of abode. By reason of his unsatisfactory performance of the CSO he was ordered to serve two month’s periodic detention, which was later increased to three months periodic detention cumulative upon the periodic detention which was imposed, in the District Court, on appeal for the next series of offences mentioned. That periodic detention order was itself later revoked by the Parole Board and replaced by a fixed sentence of 13 weeks, to be served between 4 May 1999 and 2 August 1999. 62 On 21 August 1997 he was back before the Local Court on further charges of driving an unregistered and uninsured motor vehicle, driving in a manner dangerous and driving while cancelled. On appeal to the District Court, on 23 October 1997, a two-year period of supervised recognisance, and 7 months periodic detention, commencing on 5 November 1997, were substituted. That periodic detention order was also later revoked by the Parole Board, and a further fixed sentence of 13 weeks was imposed to be served between 3 August 1999 and 1 November 1999. 63 For breaches of the recognisance, he was sentenced on 22 July 1999, to 2 fixed terms each of 2 months commencing on 22 July 1999 and concluding on 21 September 1999.64 On 18 June 1999, he was back before Burwood Local Court on 2 charges of disqualified driving, 1 charge of driving in a manner dangerous, and two charges of goods in custody, along with other offences relating to the provision of a false name and place of abode, obtaining a license by a false representation, and fraudulent use or alteration of a license. 65 For some of these offences he was fined. However, for 1 offence of disqualified driver and 1 offence of goods in custody, he was sentenced to fixed terms of 3 months each, to commence on 4 May 1999 and to conclude on 3 August 1999. For the other offences of disqualified driver, and for 1 offence of driving in manner dangerous, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 182 days also to commence on 4 May 1999, and to expire on 1 November 1999.66 As a consequence of this somewhat complex history it appears that he was still serving a sentence or sentences for unrelated matters between 4 May 1999 and 1 November 1999. He was arrested for the present offence on 17 September 1999, and on another matter which is still outstanding on 1 June 1999, and bail refused on both matters. 67 I am of the view, taking into account the totality principle, that it would be appropriate to commence the sentence which should be imposed for the present offence, on and from the date of arrest, namely 17 September 1999.68 The custody reports placed before me show that, since being placed into custody in 1999, Mawas has accumulated some 13 internal charges, recorded in Exhibit AP, relating to fighting, abusive language, threatening behaviour and language, intimidation, unauthorised property, obstruct correctional officer, resist/impede search, as well as other lesser disciplinary breaches. The last such entry was 14 April 2002. In part the explanation for these breaches may lie in the inevitable problems which a young prisoner will have in settling into the prison environment, and in the fact that he was, during the relevant period, the subject of repeated moves from one Centre to another. As such they do not necessarily give rise to the concerns which might appear on first impressions. 69 Mawas was accepted into the High Risk Management Unit at Goulburn Correctional Centre in June 2002, and since that time he has been seen by a psychologist and assessed for anger management. He has agreed to participate in an alcohol and drug assessment, and has indicated a desire to complete his Year 10 School Certificate. His conduct within the unit since that time has been assessed as generally satisfactory, as is confirmed by the Unit 9 Running Sheet. This may be a favourable, although preliminary, sign of him trying to do something more constructive with his life, than that suggested by the past 5 years.70 It would appear that his immediate family have now all returned to the Lebanon to live, and he entertains concern for their welfare if they were to return, by reason of the risk of reprisals. Contact is now confined to phone and letter. He has other friends and some community ties. A favourable report from Mr Bader, the Youth Development Officer for the Lebanese Moslem Association, has been provided which depicts him as an essentially good person who had suffered and been significantly affected by his mother’s loss.  
     
      
    71 This impression as to the reason for him going off track has some support from the reports of Dr Westmore and Mr Diment, who have carried out psychiatric and psychological assessments of him in recent times.  
     
      
    72 Dr Westmore found no evidence of any major depressive or psychotic illness, but drew attention to the fact that he appeared to have become quite an isolated individual by reason of the fact that he was being held on segregation, for reasons which were not readily apparent to him.  
     
      
    73 Mr Diment similarly noted that his history of drug abuse and lack of purpose in life had led him to an association with “DK’s Boys” and to become involved in this group as a form of job. Clinical testing showed that he was somewhat above average on reliable measures of clinical anxiety and depression, probably related to worry over the current proceedings. He thought that there was evidence of him suffering a depressive illness at the time of his mother’s illness and death. Otherwise there were no signs of any psychopathology. One test did however show that he was a person who could be influenced by others.  
     
      
    74 The Crown submitted that the level of culpability of Mawas in the present killing was so extreme that a life sentence should be imposed. I have given anxious consideration to that submission, but am not persuaded that Mawas’ culpability is of that order. 
     
      
    75 A review of the cases where sentences for the term of the offenders natural life has been imposed, including for example, R v Glover NSWSC 29 November 1991; R v Garforth NSWCCA 23 May 1994, R v Cribb NSWCCA 4 November 1994; R v Baker NSWCCA 20 September 1995, R v Boyd (1995) 81 A Crim R 260, R v Milat NSWSC 27 July 1996, R v Street NSWCCA 17 December 1996, R v Heatley NSWSC 27 February 1998, R v Leonard NSWCCA 7 December 1998, R v Rose (1999) NSWCCA 327, R v Fernando (1999) NSWCCA 66, R v Suckling (1999) NSWCCA 36, R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409, R v Glasby (2000) 115 A Crim R 465 and R v Ngo [2001] NSWSC 1021, shows that they have generally involved killings which were sex or thrill related, multiple killings, killings involving torture or undue savagery, contract killings, political assassinations, cases involving a degree of psychopathology or other circumstances clearly demonstrating a long term ongoing danger to the community, or killings which are seriously antithetical to the fabric of society or to the justice system, into which category I would for example place the deliberate or pre-planned murder of Police in the execution of their duty, or of witnesses in pending trials.  
     
      
    76 In the present case Mawas does not have a record for prior violence, nor does he show any signs of psychopathology. The explanation for his participation in this killing lies substantially in the earlier fragmentation of his life, and his descent into the utterly surreal world which Rossini himself identified. As I have earlier observed, although I am satisfied that he was directly involved as a shooter, I am also satisfied that his participation occurred because he was a follower rather than an initiator of the killing.  
     
      
    77 To some extent I consider that his immaturity led him not to fully appreciate what he had let himself into, and that once caught up in Kanaan’s planning it would not necessarily have been easy to walk away.  
     
      
    78 In all these circumstances I do not consider that the maximum sentence is called for, although the sentence to be imposed must be a significant one, because his level of culpability remains very high.  
     
      
    79 Rabeeh Mawas, for the murder of Danny Karam, I sentence you to imprisonment for 25 years to date from 17 September 1999, and to expire on 16 September 2024. I fix a non parole period of 19 years similarly to date from 17 September 1999 and to expire on 16 September 2018. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 17 September 2018.  
     
      
    80 I do not find special circumstances to exist. In that regard the only matter possibly identified as such relates to the length of the sentence, and the need for extended supervision post release, in order to facilitate the prisoner's return to the community. The potential period of 6 years release on parole would be sufficient for that purpose.  
     
      
       
      EL ASSAAD 
       
      
    81 This offender was born on 10 November 1977, and is now aged 24 years. 82 The pre sentence report shows that he is an Australian born of Lebanese parents, and the eldest child in a family of 6 children. He is reported to be very family orientated, and to be highly regarded by his parents and siblings. It is said that he occupies an important position in the family structure, and his incarceration has apparently caused his mother and siblings considerable stress. 83 Between the age of 13 years and 16 years, he and the rest of his family, returned to the Lebanon so that the children could attend school, and learn the Lebanese language and culture. Regrettably during this period, in the aftermath of the war, he became accustomed to carrying a gun for self protection. It is said that he was exposed to a considerable amount of anarchy and violence which left its mark upon him. 84 His subsequent return to Australia was described as difficult, as a result of the loss of contact with his former friends. Due to his familiarity with guns and violence, he drifted on his own account, into an undesirable peer group. He did not complete his education to Higher School Certificate, and instead worked in the family coffee shop. He is said not to have had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    85 He presented to the Probation and Parole Service as polite and cooperative, and as having expressed an intention to change his ways, now realising that the most important things he has are his family and religion. He has not caused any real problems while in custody, his record being confined to various incidents of unauthorised possession of property. The Governor of the MRRC and the Block Area Manager have each reported positively in relation to his general attitude and demeanour, and his attendance at the weekly Muslim prayer meetings. They added that he had shown himself to be a role model for other Lebanese inmates with regards to reducing violence and improving cultural harmony within the centre. 
     
      
    86 Their reports were supplemented by a report from the Islamic Chaplain at the MRRC who indicated that he had demonstrated remorse and repentance, and that he encouraged good behaviour in other inmates and leads the way by example. Whether that remorse and repentance are related to his prior offences or to the present offence remains unclear, it being the case that he has not admitted to his responsibility in relation to the murder of Danny Karam.  
     
      
    87 His earlier criminal record is not impressive, although again it is not quite as serious as its length might first suggest, largely revolving, as it does, around offences involving motor vehicles.  
     
      
       
      
    88 That record commences with a conviction for break enter and steal, in respect of which a 2 year recognisance was imposed on 9 April 1996.  
     
      
    89 On 14 May 1997 a 2 year recognisance, and a fine were imposed for an offence of attempt to steal a motor vehicle, which sentence was confirmed in the District Court. For a breach of that recognisance, he was later sentenced in the District Court, on 16 June 1999, to a fixed term of 1 month commencing on 1 June 1999.  
     
      
    90 In the meantime, he was convicted and fined, in the Local Court on 5 February 1997, for various motoring offences, including drive while cancelled, and drive in a manner dangerous.  
     
      
    91 On 28 April 1997 and 15 May 1997 he was again fined in relation to motoring offences, including two offences of driving while cancelled, two offences of stating a false name, one offence of goods in custody, as well as offences of driving an unregistered vehicle, and using an uninsured vehicle.  
     
      
    92 On 10 March 1998, he was back in the Local Court, on 3 charges of drive while disqualified, offences which earned him 3 fixed terms, each of 4 months. On appeal to the District Court on 24 April 1998, these sentences were reduced to sentences of 3 months periodic detention, each to commence on 8 May 1998.  
     
      
    93 On 4 August 1998 he was convicted and fined for an offence of driving a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner. 
     
      
    94 On 20 October 1998, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 1 month and 6 months for offences of goods in custody and steal motor vehicle, which sentences were later confirmed, on appeal to the District Court on 28 July 1999, the sentences being directed to commence on 1 July 1999, and to expire on 31 July 1999, and 31 December 1999, respectively.95 On 7 July 1999, he was convicted and sentenced in the Local Court to a fixed term of 6 weeks for an offence of goods in custody, which conviction and sentence were again confirmed on appeal by the District Court on 28 October 1999, the sentence being directed to commence on 28 October 1999, and to conclude on 8 December 1999. 
     
      
    96 On 24 August 1999 pending the last mentioned appeal, he was fined for further motoring offences involving the use of an uninsured and unregistered vehicle, the fraudulent use of a licence, and stating a false name; additionally he was sentenced to further fixed terms of 6 months, each to commence on 1 June 1999 and to expire on 30 November 1999, for 4 further counts of drive while disqualified.  
     
      
    97 Then, on 21 December 1999 he was sentenced to concurrent fixed sentences of imprisonment for 20 months, with non parole periods of 15 months, when convicted of counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm and an unregistered firearm. On this occasion, appeals to the District Court were dismissed, on 13 July 2000. These sentences were directed to commence on 1 January 2000 and to expire on 31 August 2001 with the non parole periods expiring on 31 March 2001. The offences to which they related occurred at a time when he was present with other offenders who became involved in a shoot out with police at White City. He was himself shot during this incident, but it was not alleged that he was responsible for any of the gunfire which occurred. 
     
      
    98 The net result of this history, which involved a significant adjustment and backdating for various offences, is that although arrested and bail refused for another matter from 1 June 1999, and for the current offence from 17 September 1999, he is to be regarded as having been held in custody in respect of the other offences mentioned between 1 June 1999 and 31 March 2001, that being the date on which he would have necessarily been released on parole for the firearm offences.  
     
      
    99 Having regard to the principle of totality, however, it similarly appears appropriate to backdate the sentence for the present offence to the date of arrest, namely 17 September 1999. 100 Similarly in his case I have given consideration to whether or not the maximum sentence of imprisonment is required. For essentially the same reasons as those which applied to Mawas, I conclude in the case of El Assaad that I should not impose such a sentence.  
     
      
    101 To some extent his participation was less heinous than that of those who were prepared to discharge their weapons at Karam, although like a wheelman in an armed robbery, or the person who contracts another to kill on his behalf, he was integrally involved in the killing and he played an important role in sending the alert.  
     
      
    102 It cannot be said that the killing would not have occurred without his participation. Nevertheless, he joined in as an active member of the enterprise, and he knew precisely what was to occur. 
     
      
    103 On the more favourable side is his absence of any prior record for violence, or signs of psychopathology of the kind which would suggest that he poses any continuing danger to law abiding members of the community. On the contrary, there are some signs that he can make a positive contribution while within the prison system, and that the prospects for rehabilitation are reasonable.  
     
      
    104 Again, I believe that it was his immaturity, and early exposure to violence and anarchy, which led to him being attracted into the world established by Karam and Kanaan, and then foolishly following them, in their drug dealing activities, and in the murderous plot hatched by Kanaan. Upon that basis, I am of the view that the case does not meet the s 61(1) criteria, although a significant sentence must be imposed. 
     
      
    105 I am not persuaded, particularly having regard to his somewhat worse record that there is reason for any significant difference in sentence between him and Mawas. Some small difference is however justified, since he has demonstrated positive signs of a commitment to rehabilitation, and his objective criminality on this occasion was marginally less serious.  
     
      
    106 Wassim El Assaad, for the murder of Danny Karam I sentence you to imprisonment for 24 years to date from 17 September 1999 and to expire on 16 September 2023. I fix a non parole period of 18 years similarly to date from 17 September 1999, and to expire on 16 September 2017. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 17 September 2017. 
     
      
    107 Similarly I do not find any special circumstances to exist. In that regard I am satisfied that the period of 6 years during which the prisoner will be potentially eligible for release and supervision on parole is sufficient to enable his reintegration into the community.

      70060/01 – REGINA v Stanley James FYFFE 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Stanley James Fyffe, was found guilty by the jury of the murder on 19 March 2000 at Silverwater of Stephen Anthony Moore. At the time of the death of the deceased he, the offender, his co-offender Anthony John Hore and a man I shall call X were prisoners serving their sentences at the Silverwater correctional facility. All were housed in B wing. 
     
      
    2 B wing is one of a number of free-standing brick buildings arranged more or less on a north-south axis. It is the most southerly building and its main entrance is on its north side, facing other blocks. To the south of its southern side is a small yard, bounded to the south by a wire mesh fence behind which are tennis courts and the southern perimeter wall of the complex. The southern side of the wing comprises two walls of equal length which join in the centre in a concave right angle. The wings formed by the walls make the yard a secluded place. Another feature which makes for its seclusion is a flat awning supported on posts and attached to the walls. It is triangular and fits into the corner where the walls meet. It covers only part of the yard. Although the windows of some cells overlook the yard they do not for the most part afford any view of events happening under the awning. 
     
      
    3 In March 2000 inmates used to use the yard for sporting exercises of various kinds. Balls would be thrown and bounced. There was a punching bag hanging on a hook secured to the underside of the awning. Access from the northern side of B wing to the yard at the southern side could be gained by walking round the wing on the eastern or on the western side. 
     
      
    4 The wing lies in a minimum security part of the complex and for the most part inmates housed in it, as well as those housed elsewhere in the complex, had the free run of the wing. They could visit each other’s cells. 
     
      
    5 The deceased shared cell 75 with William Bond. The offender shared cell 70 with William Charlton. Hore occupied cell 72 alone. X shared cell 71 with another inmate. 
     
      
    6 At 1.30 pm or a little later on the day the deceased was murdered two inmates took a block of sandstone slightly larger than a football and weighing more than six kilograms from the front to the back of the wing. I am satisfied that they left it near to or in the place where the deceased was killed in preparation for the attack on him. As they transported the block they threw it back and forth between themselves as though it were a football. I am satisfied that they did so in order to divert suspicion from themselves by appearing to be involved in innocent play. 
     
      
    7 The witness who gave evidence about this event identified one of the men as X and said that another man, who had the rock, said to him - 
     
      
       
        
        Come on, let’s pass this like a football. 
        
       
      
    8 They began to pass it between themselves and as they did so they disappeared from sight round the back of B wing. The witness told the Court that he could not remember who the other man was. He was shown a copy of a statement he signed on 3 April 2000 in which he identified the other man as the offender. He said, however, that that had just been a guess. He was reminded of evidence he gave on oath before the magistrate identifying the man as the offender but responded by saying he had been assuming that it was he. 
     
      
    9 I have set out the details of his evidence because it was submitted on sentence that I should not conclude that the offender was one of those who took the sandstone block to the back of the wing. I reject the submission. I am satisfied that the witness correctly identified him and told the truth to the police and to the magistrate. His evidence before the jury, in which he affected to be unsure who the man was, was false. 
     
      
    10 Shortly before the deceased was murdered another inmate saw three men walking together towards B wing from the direction of C wing. When they arrived at B wing they separated. Two of them walked around the eastern side of the wing and went towards the back, out of sight. The other went into the wing and emerged some two minutes later with the deceased. They were walking very closely together and talking in a friendly manner. They walked around the western side of B wing towards the back. 
     
      
    11 Later on the same three men, but not the deceased, re-emerged from the back of the wing, walking along, talking, laughing and patting each other. They continued on towards C wing. Shortly afterwards the deceased was found and the alarm was raised. 
     
      
    12 The witness recognised the men but could not name them. He described them in a way that fitted the descriptions of the offender, Hore and X. 
     
      
    13 A further inmate occupied cell 57, which was on the first floor overlooking the yard at the rear of the wing. He was half-seated, half-lying on his bed with his back to the wall in which the window was mounted. His attention was drawn to three or four thudding noises coming from the yard. Each thud was followed by a sound he described as “weird”. The noises were unlike those that normally came from the yard. He raised himself on his bed, looked out of the window and saw two men walking away from the direction of the awning. He recognised them as inmates he had seen in the wing. He identified the offender by the cell he occupied and by naming his cellmate. He gave a description consistent with the offender’s appearance. He identified Hore. His evidence was impressive. The jury accepted it. 
     
      
    14 I am satisfied that one of the boots that Hore was then wearing was spattered with the deceased’s blood.  
     
      
    15 The deceased’s body was found lying in the yard under the awning. Near it were found the sandstone block and a half-brick, each bearing his blood. Hair adhered to the half-brick. Dr Hulewicz examined the body. There was no substantial injury to any part of the body other than the head. The hands, wrists and forearms bore abrasions that must have been sustained as the deceased tried to defend himself. There were minor abrasions and bruises to other parts of the body. Eighteen lacerations, abrasions and bruises were seen on the head. A triangular laceration to the forehead, three and a half centimetres by two and a half centimetres in size, was consistent with having been caused by a corner of the half-brick. The other injuries were consistent with having been caused by the sandstone block. 
     
      
    16 The injuries to the skull were of a kind ordinarily seen only when deceased persons have been injured by lateral skull impact in motor vehicle accidents or in falls from height. There was what Dr Hulewicz called a hinge fracture which passed horizontally from side to side across the base of the skull, from temporal bone to temporal bone, enabling the skull to be opened and closed. Several fracture lines radiated from that fracture into the front and the right of the skull. Two fracture lines extended from the great foramen into the right and left sides of the back of the skull. There was subdural haemorrhage over the base of the brain. The right lower jaw and the cheekbone were fractured. The left cheekbone was fractured. There was a comminuted fracture of the right side of the hard palate. 
     
      
    17 Dr Hulewicz thought that the injuries were caused either when the sandstone block was held and used to strike the deceased’s head once or more than once or when it was dropped one or more times onto his head. 
     
      
    18 Photographs tendered in evidence show splashes of blood on the walls adjacent to the place where the deceased was killed. They show that at least one blow was delivered with great force after the deceased began bleeding. The splashes are low on the walls and show that the blood source was near ground level. This evidence and the evidence of what the inmate heard from cell 57 satisfies me that the sandstone block was dropped three or four times onto the head of the deceased as he lay on the concrete surface of the yard. I think that the thud that he heard was the sound of the block striking the skull of the deceased. The block would have rolled onto the concrete surface of the yard after hitting the skull, and the sound of its doing so may have been the sound the inmate could only describe as “weird”. It is possible that before the block was dropped onto the deceased’s head he was felled by a blow with the half-brick. 
     
      
    19 The offender entered into the compact to kill the deceased at the latest by the time he and X took the sandstone block to the back of the wing. 
     
      
    20 There is no evidence of who used the half-brick or of who dropped the sandstone block onto the deceased’s head. All that can be said about the offender is that he was present with the intention that the deceased should be killed and participated by either doing the act which caused death or by assisting in its commission or by encouraging another or others to do so. 
     
      
    21 Shortly before he murdered the deceased the offender told his cellmate that he did not want the deceased in their cell because he was a dog. A dog in prison parlance is an inmate who informs on another prisoner by providing a statement to the police, giving evidence in court and the like. Such informers are held in low esteem by other inmates and are likely on that account to find themselves in personal danger. However, the evidence raises no more than a suspicion that the offender killed the deceased because he was an informer. There is no satisfactory evidence that explains why he acted as he did. 
     
      
    22 S 19A Crimes Act provides that a person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life and that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life. The section also preserves the Court’s discretion to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. 
     
      
    23 Subs 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. By subs (3) nothing in subs (1) affects the discretion of the Court that arises under subs 21(1) to impose instead a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. It is now settled that notwithstanding the terms of subs 61(1) the Court retains a discretion in any case whether to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life or for a specified term: R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469. 
     
      
    24 The offender was born on 30 September 1966. He was thirty-three years old at the time of the murder and is now thirty-five years old. He was first before a children’s court at thirteen years of age for car stealing. Since then he has committed many such offences and has served a number of prison terms. He has a bad record of traffic offences, many of them involving alcohol. He has only one conviction for assault. In 1993 he was sentenced to serve a period of imprisonment for interfering with a witness. At the time of the murder he was serving a number of sentences which were due to expire on 15 June 2001. He was later sentenced to serve a further term which expired on 11 April 2002. 
     
      
    25 The offender did not give evidence on sentence. A report of Anna Robilliard, psychologist, was tendered. One purpose was to inform the Court of things that only the offender could say. I regard it as partially reliable in that respect. His mother left the home shortly after his birth and he never really knew her. He was brought up by his father and a step-mother. His father was a drunkard who flogged him. He ran away from home at twelve years of age and began to commit the offences for which he was brought before the Children’s Court. He spent time in boys’ homes. He told Ms Robilliard that when he was sixteen years old his parents falsely charged him with theft because he would not assist them move to Queensland. He was sent to gaol for six months. 
     
      
    26 He also told Ms Robilliard that he had generally worked as a scaffolder and rigger and was always able to get jobs when he wanted them. He said that in 1998 he suffered a serious accident at work, injuring his back. He had had surgery in 1999 and had not been able to return to work. I regard his claim to be unable to work as surprising in view of the way he handled the sandstone block. 
     
      
    27 He has had a number of relationships with women and has a daughter and a son. He wishes to maintain a relationship he formed with the mother of his son. 
     
      
    28 He says that he has given up the heavy drinking that so affected his life until 1998. He has smoked some cannabis and has become addicted to heroin. He says that he took these drugs in order to seek relief from back pain. 
     
      
    29 Ms Robilliard administered psychological tests. She concluded that he was soundly intelligent and that his school performance and subsequent work history did not reflect his true level of cognitive ability. She thought him capable of improving his education at technical or TAFE level. She thought that the personality test results demonstrated markedly paranoid personality attributes and a depressive and self-focus predisposition. At a reactive level he was highly anxious, hypervigilant, suspicious and wary. 
     
      
    30 The deprivation and cruelty which attended the offender’s childhood and teenage years were likely to lead to criminal behaviour and to the use of and perhaps addiction to alcohol and other drugs. They make much of the offender’s criminal history understandable. They were also likely to reduce his sensitivity to violence and it is surprising that the offences he committed before the present murder, though many, have not been characterised by violent acts. According to his record he has been convicted and imprisoned once for assault, according to Ms Robilliard twice. 
     
      
    31 However, none of the events of his life explains why he might have committed this offence. No alcohol or other drug was involved. There was no confrontation, no flaring of temper, no spontaneity. 
     
      
    32 The offender continues to deny the offence and is without remorse. 
     
      
    33 A serious feature of the murder is that it was carried out in a prison. It was a minimum security prison and the offender abused the freedom that his classification in that environment afforded him. It is particularly important that courts impose sentences calculated to deter the commission of offences in prison. Officers who administer prison communities are entitled to expect that inmates will be deterred from offending. Equally, inmates serving their sentences as best they may are entitled to as much protection as the courts can afford them. 
     
      
    34 The murder of the deceased was an execution of the coolest kind. It was carefully planned. The deceased, a man of small build, was lured under some pretext to the place of execution. He was there swiftly and efficiently put down by three strong men. His injuries were horrific. The murder was an act of great depravity. The fact that it is not possible to say precisely what part the offender played does not remove his crime from the worst category of offences of murder. 
     
      
    35 There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can be met only through the imposition of the maximum penalty. In such cases it is necessary to disregard what might otherwise be persuasive subjective circumstances, so that they play no part in the decision of the Court. In my opinion this is such a case because the wickedness of the offender’s crime was so great. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion the offender’s level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met only through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    37 Stanley James Fyffe, you are sentenced to imprisonment for life. Your sentence will be taken to have commenced on 12 April 2002.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Heydon JA.  
      
       
     2 HEYDON JA: This is an application by an unsuccessful defendant for leave to appeal against an order made by Gibson DCJ on 14 December 2001 extending the time within which to commence proceedings to 14 December 2001.  
      
       
     3 The application for leave was heard concurrently with the appeal, and full argument was advanced, to the intent that if leave were granted the appeal could be decided without additional argument. 
      
       
        
       The background 
        
       
     4 The opponent was born on 16 December 1974. He was a pupil of the claimant’s in the years 1987-1992. On 11 August 1999 he filed a Notice of Application to Commence Proceedings in which he sought an extension of the limitation period. That order was made on 27 October 1999 by Christie DCJ. Despite the fact that the claimant was given prior notice of that hearing, as was its liability insurer, FAI Insurance Ltd, the claimant did not attend. Indeed, the unsatisfactory conduct of the liability insurer, which had the carriage of the claimant’s defence of the case, did not stop there. In a passage of which the claimant voiced no criticism, the primary judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “After the order extending time was made, the defendant filed a defence (which did not plead any defence under the  
         Limitations Act 
         ) and arranged a medical appointment for the plaintiff with a psychiatrist. That report has never been served. 
         
        
        
         
         During 2000 the matter came up for call over and the defendant was invariably unready. On 18 July 2000 Registrar Howe noted the defendant was not ready. The defendant was ordered to show cause and this application was stood over on various dates until 24 April 2001, when the insurer changed. The defendant then brought an application to vacate the orders of Judge Christie of 27 October 1999.” 
         
        
       
     5 On 19 July 2001 a District Court judge vacated the order made on 27 October 1999. The evidence relied on before that judge and the reasons of that judge for vacating the order are not in the papers. No appeal against the order vacating the 27 October 1999 order is before this Court. It does seem regrettable that the opponent’s hopes were raised by the order of 27 October 1999 only to be disappointed by the order of 19 July 2001. It seems that the responsibility for this state of affairs lay with the claimant’s liability insurer rather than with the claimant itself. However, whether it is regrettable or not, the opponent’s Notice of Application had to be reheard. The primary judge reheard it on 22 November 2001. She reserved judgment until 14 December 2001, when she made the orders complained of (including costs orders which were favourable to the opponent because of the events just described).  
      
       
        
       The opponent’s Statement of Claim 
        
       
     6 On 9 November 1999 the opponent filed a Statement of Claim pursuant to the order of 27 October 1999 extending the limitation period. It was as follows. 
      
       
        
         
         “1. At all material times the Defendant is a company incorporated in the state of New South Wales and entitled to sue and be sued in its corporate name and style. 
         
        
        
         
         2. At all material times the Defendant operated a secondary education institution. 
         
        
        
         
         3. During the period from 1987 to 1993 the Plaintiff was and remained a student of the Defendant and was therefore in the custody and care of the Defendant and the Defendant thereupon became the guardian/custodian of the physical, moral and spiritual welfare of the Plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Throughout the course of the year 1998 [sic] the Plaintiff was subjected to obscene and/or indecent and/or gross and/or gratuitously violent acts of abuse of a physical and/or sexual and/or psychological nature. In particular: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) On two occasions in the first term of 1998 [sic] the Plaintiff was in the shower receptacle at the Defendant’s premises when a fellow student … physically touched the Plaintiff in a sexual manner. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) In 1998 [sic] the Plaintiff was asleep in the boarding house dormitory and was physically assaulted by [the fellow student]. 
         
        
        
         
         As a result of the matters aforesaid the Plaintiff has suffered injury, loss and damage. 
         
        
        
         
         The Plaintiff has suffered the injuries as a consequence of the negligence of the Defendant.

         (c) Failed to react appropriately to evidence and/or complaints that [the fellow student] was occasioning acts of abuse on students such as the Plaintiff.

         (f) Concealing from:

         6. Further or in the alternative, the Defendant was in breach of its fiduciary duty of lico parentas [sic] and/or as guardian of the Plaintiff.

         7. And the Plaintiff claims damages, costs and interest pursuant to s 83A of the District Court Act.” 
         
        
       
     7 The following Statement pursuant to Part 9 Rule 27 was filed: 
      
       
        
         
         “1.

          The Plaintiff has been restricted in his ability to earn on the open labour market and claims in respect of a diminution of earning capacity.” 
         
        
       
     8 Leaving aside formal imperfections in the Statement of Claim, it may be said of both it and the Part 9 Rule 27 Statement that, given the seriousness of the allegations against both the claimant and the fellow student, there are grave deficiencies in point of detail, and there are also wholly improbable contentions. In what sense was the fellow student “responsible for the care and welfare of the children”? What “acts of abuse on certain other students” were there? What “evidence and/or complaints” did the claimant have notice of? A further feature of the Statement of Claim is that it appears to complain of two distinct sets of conduct on the part of the claimant: conduct before the incidents alleged in paragraph 4, and contact after those incidents. Thus within the particulars of negligence, particulars (a)-(e), (g)-(j) and perhaps (f) appear to complain of the claimant’s failure to prevent the incidents arising, and particulars (k)-(l) and perhaps (f) appear to complain of the claimant’s failure to assist the opponent properly after the incidents had occurred. Finally, vague though the Part 9 Rule 27 particulars are, they convey an impression, particularly in relation to economic loss, which is at variance with the evidence filed.  
      
       
        
       The legislation 
        
       
     9 The opponent’s Statement of Claim complained of “injuries”, and the particularisation of them in the Part 9 Rule 27 Statement revealed that the allegations were allegations of personal injury.  
      
       
     10 Since the injuries complained of arose out of three alleged incidents while the opponent was at the school in 1988, at a time when he was in his fourteenth year, the relevant legislation to be considered by the primary judge was the Limitation Act 1969, ss 14, 18A, 52(1), 60A, 60B, 60C and 60E(1), together with Schedule 5 clause 4(1) and (4). All that legislation was also relied on by the opponent in written submissions to this Court, and though senior counsel for the opponent declined to speak to the written submissions, and said he was “not going to say a word about it”, he did not abandon them. He said he would “leave the written submissions where they stand so your Honours can make a decision”. Although counsel’s shrinking from the written submissions in relation to s 60C is understandable, it remains necessary to deal with them.

     16 Section 60C provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) This section applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury, but does not apply to a cause of action arising under the

         (a) the plaintiff:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) did not know that personal injury had been suffered, or  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered, or  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission,  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted, and  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the application is made within 3 years after the plaintiff became aware (or ought to have become aware) of all 3 matters listed in paragraph (a) (i)--(iii).” 
           
          
         
        
       
     21 Schedule 5, clause 4(1) and (4) provide: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued or would have accrued before 1 September 1990, but does not apply to a cause of action arising under the  
         Compensation to Relatives Act 1897. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The court may make an order under section 60G or 60H, in relation to a cause of action referred to in this clause, if an application for such an order is made within: 
         
        
        
         
          (a) the period of 3 years referred to in section 60I, or 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the period of 3 years commencing on 1 September 1990.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       The irrelevance of s 60C and s 60E 
        
       
     22 If the opponent’s cause of action had accrued before 1 September 1990, there would have been a six year limitation period, because of ss 14(1)(b) and 18A(1)(b), and ss 60A and 60C would not apply because of s 60B. But if the cause of action had accrued after 1 September 1990, then there would have been a three year limitation period: s18A(2). The running of the limitation period would have been suspended until the opponent obtained his majority on 16 December 1992. Sections 60A, 60C and 60E would have applied, but would only have permitted a five year extension of the three year limitation period, ie up to 16 December 2000. The opponent contended in writing that the cause of action did not accrue until 16 December 1992: “Opponent‘s Arguments” B paragraph 4. The opponent also contended that there was a six year limitation period (“Opponent’s Arguments in A para 1.4”).  
      
       
     23 Contrary to what is said in the opponent’s written submissions, the correct position is as follows.  
      
       
     24 The opponent’s cause of action is in negligence. A cause of action in negligence is complete – “accrues” – when the victim suffers actual damage, as distinct from damage which is only negligible, non-measurable, prospective or contingent: Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302 at [13]-[14]. The cause of action accrued in 1988: either at the moment of the third incident complained of (since the other two by themselves do not appear to have caused any damage), or soon afterwards, in consequence of the claimant’s alleged failure to assist the opponent. The cause of action accrued even though the running of the limitation period was suspended until 16 December 1992 by reason of s 52(1). It was open to the opponent to have sued the claimant at any time from, or very soon after, the time of the third incident. It would have been necessary for a tutor to have been appointed pursuant to Part 45 of the District Court Rules, but the proceedings would have been the opponent’s proceedings in reliance on injuries to the opponent. The suspension of the running of the limitation period prevented time running against the opponent during his minority, but that did not postpone or suspend his right to start proceedings: O’Brien v O’Brien (1995) 35 NSWLR 664 at 666.  
      
       
     25 The limitation period was six years: s 18A(1)(b). That six year period ran from 16 December 1992 and hence expired on 16 December 1998. The avenue for extension of that limitation period afforded by ss 60A, 60C and 60E is not available since those sections only apply to causes of action accruing after 1 September 1990: s 60B. 
      
       
     26 Hence the only available avenue of extension of the limitation period is that afforded by ss 60G and 60I. The avenue of extension they offer is available so long as the application was made within three years of the opponent becoming aware of the s 60I matters. This means that the application had to fail unless the opponent established that he did not become aware of one of the matters described in s 60I(1)(a) until after 16 December 1998 and his application was made within three years of the moment when he became aware, or ought to have become aware, of all the matters described in s 60I(1)(a). The event on which the opponent relied as giving him the necessary awareness was a report by Dr Morse dated 6 April 1999; and he contended that it was not the case that he either became aware, or ought to have become aware, before that date.  
      
       
     27 In consequence of those conclusions, it is not necessary to deal either with the primary judge’s reasoning in relation to s 60C or with the opponent’s arguments about s 60C.  
      
       
        
       The opponent’s affidavit 
        
       
     28 Before turning to the claimant’s criticisms of the primary judge’s reasoning in relation to ss 60G and 60I, it is convenient to set out the material parts of the affidavit of 9 August 1999 relied on by the opponent in support of his application.  
      
       
        
         
         “1. I am the Plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         2. I was enrolled to commence studies at the Cranbrook School in Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill from the beginning of January 1987. I started from Year 7 as a boarding student. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In the first term of 1988 whilst I was in the shower at school a fellow student … brushed against me. At the time I was not wearing any clothes and nor was he. This experience made me feel uncomfortable. The same situation occurred approximately one week later. [The fellow student] did not say anything to me at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Later in the year, I was asleep in my bed in the boarding house dormitory and I was woken as a person had their hand on my testicles. As soon as I became aware of this, I screamed and the person walked quickly out of the dormitory. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The boarding master … came to the room and I explained to him what had occurred. [The boarding master] told me and the other students in the dormitory to quieten down and then turned to me and said words to the effect, ‘wait here’. 
         
        
        
         
         6. A short while later [the boarding master] returned to the dormitory with two police officers who I understood to be stationed at Rose Bay. 
         
        
        
         
         7. The officers identified themselves to me and then obtained my consent to take a statement in front of [the boarding master]. At the time they took a statement from me one of the officers recorded the details in his notebook. 
         
        
        
         
         8. After the police left, [the boarding master] spoke with me in the dormitory and said to me, ‘the police think that it was somebody from inside the house because there was no break and enter’. At this time I was still in a great deal of shock about the incident. I was sitting in my bed with my legs pulled up. [The boarding master] directed me to go to sleep. I said to him, ‘… I am unable to sleep, can I have a shower?’ I was given approval to have a shower by [the boarding master]. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The next day I was called into [the boarding master’s] office. He said to me, ‘’who do you think did this?’ I replied that I believed that I knew who it was and gave him the name of the student who I believe had assaulted me. [The boarding master] then left the room and brought back another student with him. … [The boarding master] asked [the other student] who he thought the person was that had assaulted me. [The other student] replied that he believed that it was the same student that I had indicated to [the boarding master] as being responsible. [The boarding master] then said to me, ‘Okay, we will deal with it from here, I don’t want to hear any talk about this around the school until it is resolved’. [The boarding master’s] comments made me feel that it would be wrong to discuss what had occurred with any other person. 
         
        
        
         
         10. At the time I was assaulted the student who I believe was responsible was in Year 9. He was known in the dormitory as being a trouble maker and bully. I was physically afraid of that student. 
         
        
        
         
         11. Several days after the assault occurred I was asked to attend the officer of the headmaster … . At that time he said to me, ‘Garth, this is a very serious matter and I want you to think about whether you believe that it was [the fellow student]’. I told [the headmaster] that I believe [sic] that it was. [The headmaster] then said, ‘Okay, thank you’. I then left his office. 
         
        
        
         
         12. I was extremely upset about the assault. I did not tell my parents what had occurred as I was embarrassed and I was afraid that if I told my parents about what had occurred they would believe that it was my fault. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The assault was never discussed with me by any other teacher at the school. 
         
        
        
         
         14. About two weeks after the assault occurred I walked into the dormitory after lunch and noticed the [fellow] student’s locker had been cleared out and all his personal effects were gone. I did not see the [fellow] student after that time. … 
         
        
        
         
         15. About one week after the assault, I approached [the boarding master] outside his office. I said to him, ‘… is anything happening about what happened last week?’ He said to me, ‘We’ll discuss this at a later date’. As soon as he had finished saying that, he walked away. 
         
        
        
         
         16. I felt guilty about being assaulted and was too embarrassed to discuss the incident with anybody. At no time was I ever offered any counselling or medical assistance by the school and other than the conversations referred to above, I have not discussed the matter with any other student or Master while I was a pupil at the school. 
         
        
        
         
         17. I matriculated from the school in 1992. 
         
        
        
         
         18. After the student left the school I continued to suffer from fear, anxiety and depression. I would wake up from sleep screaming and quite often I would be under my bunk in the dormitory. I was scared that I would be assaulted again whilst I was asleep. 
         
        
        
         
         19. About two years ago I spoke with [W] who was a student with me at Cranbrook. He said to me, ‘[The fellow student] has pressed charges against [X]’. I understood that he was referring to a tutor who was employed by the school when we were students. He then said to me, ‘I had to be a witness and [X] was convicted and put in gaol’. 
         
        
        
         
         20. After this situation, I thought about the assault much more frequently. I was very angry that [X] had assaulted [the fellow student] and I felt that the other Masters must have known what had occurred. It made me very angry that no action was taken to prevent these assaults occurring. I also felt sympathy for [the fellow student]. 
         
        
        
         
         21. After this conversation I would think about the assault daily. I felt depressed and guilty. I felt that I had been tricked by the school and was very angry that nothing was done at the time and that I was unable to do anything to help [the fellow student] or resolve what had occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         22. After I had spoken with [W] I had a conversation with my parents about the assault. They told me that they had not been informed that the assault had occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         23. I am advised by my solicitors that a claim for damages is required to be lodged within three (3) years of my eighteenth birthday. Prior to receiving this advice, I was not aware that a time limit existed. I have not been a party to any other civil proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         24. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter ‘A’ is a medical report of Dr P Morse dated 6 April 1999.” 
         
        
        
       Dr Morse’s report 
        
       
     29 Dr Morse’s report is addressed to solicitors then acting for the opponent, who were the solicitors who filed the Notice of Application dated 11 August 1999, but who were not the solicitors acting in this Court.  
      
       
        
         
         “Thank you for referring Mr Stanley for a psychiatric report and opinion in relation to a sexual assault which he said occurred in 1988 when he was aged fourteen at Cranbrook School. 
         
        
        
         
         Assault and Subsequent Progress 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stanley said that he was a boarder at Cranbrook School in Year 8 when he was woken at 4.00 am with someone grabbing him in the genital area. He was shocked. He said he woke up screaming and frightened, the assailant suddenly left and Year 12 students who were in charge of the dormitory ran in. He said he thought he saw another student [ie the fellow student] leaving and other people thought also that this person had run out. 
         
        
        
         
         He was shocked and upset. The Housemaster and the Principal interviewed him but nothing more was done. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he feels that it was [the fellow student] and a month later this student was expelled. He doesn’t know what the circumstances were. He was worried and upset about this and although he was pretty sure this was the person who ran out of the room, he is concerned that he may have been mistaken. The fact that this boy’s brother was in his year also caused tension and distress.  
         
        
        
         
         He continued to be very frightened and concerned at night. He said he was sleeping on the floor underneath the bunks. If he heard noises he would wake up and scream. He said he and other students set up mazes with lockers in the room. He said if he heard any noise at night he would start screaming but was never attacked again. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he was told by school authorities not to talk about it and he kept calling out at night and this distress at night continued for some time. 
         
        
        
         
         He spoke of things settling down over time though it always affected his attitude towards the school, he eventually got his HSC and left and did a marketing course and played first grade rugby for Easts Rugby Club but had a knee reconstruction and had to discontinue his football career though he coaches a junior Easts team at present. 
         
        
        
         
         About two years ago the [fellow student] brought charges against one of the school teachers and the teacher got out on appeal. He was contacted after this case by a person from Brunei who was a pupil at the school who had also been expelled in Year 10, saying that he was going to press charges against this teacher. He said the teacher has not been found. This brought up the memories of his own experience and caused him to be tense and agitated and depressed when thinking of [the fellow student] and perhaps that [the fellow student] did what he did because of what happened to him and also uncertainties about whether or not it was [the fellow student] and this caused him to be upset. 
         
        
        
         
         He has continued to be emotionally upset and distressed over the last two years.  
         
        
        
         
         Emotional Symptoms and State 
         
        
        
         
         He described being emotionally disturbed for two years after the assault (he was fearful when describing this) and it seemed to settle down until about two years ago when the matter of the teacher as described above came to the fore. He said he had a tremendous feeling of guilt that he got [the fellow student] into trouble and he has been brooding about this over the last two years. He said he gets worried that [the fellow student] will somehow seek revenge on him. He heard that [the fellow student] took up truck driving and he feels that maybe he changed his life and has feelings of guilt and was upset and distressed when describing this. He is worried about what [the fellow student] thinks of him. He said he believes because of what he did, ie Mr Stanley, that [the fellow student] has been labelled as a ‘sex offender’. 
         
        
        
         
         It has always been on the back of his mind but over the last few years with brooding and thinking about what happened, being upset by the incident itself and concerned about [the fellow student] and wondering and being puzzled about the actions of the school teacher in question it has come to the fore and he has become upset and crying a lot and doesn’t know why. He described being down and depressed and sad and worried about it. He said ‘I feel guilty’ and has a sense of inadequacy. He has a feeling of not wishing to be involved with people. 
         
        
        
         
         He said it has ‘destroyed my sense of confidence’ (he cried and was very upset when talking about this). 
         
        
        
         
         He has suffered sleep disturbance over the last two or so years, difficulty getting off to sleep and waking up at night and has had dreams of incidents similar to that he experienced. 
         
        
        
         
         He said the incident and subsequent events ‘destroyed’ his memories of his childhood and he can’t think of the good things of childhood now and although he speaks of the good things that Cranbrook did for him, he can’t think of those things and just thinks of the incident and the way it was handled. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he was told to tell no-one and didn’t tell his parents until two months ago. The Housemaster and the Principal of the school ‘did nothing’ and all this makes him depressed and gives him a feeling of being ‘useless’. 
         
        
        
         
         He is not as enthusiastic, not as motivated or driven as he was. He said he always wanted to help others but now he doesn’t feel like doing things. 
         
        
        
         
         He is not angry or irritable. He said he smokes when he drinks. He drinks alcohol once sometimes twice a week and on occasions ‘too much’. He doesn’t take other drugs. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he has trouble trusting people especially older men. At the same time he feels there is something wrong with him and he feels ‘guilty’. He is less wanting to get involved in relationships now. 
         
        
        
         
         He described low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence. This has been particularly so over the last two years. 
         
        
        
         
         Employment and Activity 
         
        
        
         
         He felt that he couldn’t work for anyone and so he started his own legal investigation business and this is going well though he feels his work has been affected because he gets distracted easily and can’t concentrate. He feels he has to do everything for himself and has problems in giving work to others and delegating and has to do something about this and this seems to be made worse. 
         
        
        
         
         He spends most of his time in the Eastern Suburbs, he coaches a junior rugby team and goes out with friends and said he has a full social life though has less enthusiasm about this lately. 
         
        
        
         
         Family and Social Situation 
         
        
        
         
         He lives with his mother and father at Bayview. He has an older brother and sister and said he gets on well with his parents. He said they knew nothing about this and he was told to tell no-one and he feels betrayed by this, as though he was made to feel alone and isolated so he wouldn’t take any action. His parents were distressed when they found out and they have always been supportive and helpful of him. 
         
        
        
         
         He gets on well with his brother. He has had lots of girlfriends but doesn’t seem to feel confident at this time to develop a full-time relationship because of the way he feels and uncertainty of his future. 
         
        
        
         
         Past Health and Development 
         
        
        
         
         No other assaults, no accidents or injuries. He had a knee reconstruction due to a football injury, no other major accidents or injuries, no major illnesses, never suffered from or treated for emotional or mental disorder. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he was picked up for drink driving when he was younger and was charged with causing damage to a vehicle when he said he was swerved at in a parking station at North Sydney and he hit the car. He feels this was unjust that he was the one who was charged, given what happened. No other forensic problems. 
         
        
        
         
         He described no other crises, problems or difficulties in his life. 
         
        
        
         
         Mental State and Examination 
         
        
        
         
         At interview he presented as a tall man who looked younger than his stated age. He was in no particular distress and no physical abnormalities were apparent. 
         
        
        
         
         He was friendly and outgoing and co-operative. He seemed anxious to talk and to tell his story and expressed distress at the emotional state that he experienced over the last two years. 
         
        
        
         
         He became agitated and tense when describing what happened and was very tearful, almost to the point of lacking in control at some stage and he said he could not explain why this was so. When I asked why he was so upset and distressed he said ‘I don’t know’ though later on he said ‘I say I don’t know but I do know’ and although he had difficulty explaining this he said it was because he was upset about what happened at school and because of the concern at the distress he would have caused [the fellow student] and to some extent his fear of [the fellow student]. However, he went on to say he has a feeling of confusion, a lack of confidence and uncertainty about his future. 
         
        
        
         
         He said he is worried about the effect it had on his life and concerned at what’s going to happen. He spoke at length about not wanting to take action because he believed that Cranbrook School had done a lot for him in establishing his self-confidence and helping him establish his rugby career and he made a lot of good friends. On the other hand he is distressed and upset that what happened to him and he thinks others was swept under the carpet and he was made to feel isolated and alone and without support He thought very seriously about taking this action but he thinks it needs to be done. He is worried about the effect on [the fellow student] of the particular teacher getting off on appeal and he is also concerned about what happened to the man from Brunei.  
         
        
        
         
         Opinion 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stanley would have suffered quite marked emotional distress at the time of the incident and immediately after the incident. He would have experienced quite marked anxiety, tension, feelings of depression, isolation and fear which is both realistically based and would have been part of a post-traumatic stress disorder at that time from what he described of his symptoms. 
         
        
        
         
         His feeling of fear, tension and many other symptoms would have been made much worse by the fact that he was told not to tell anyone, that no particular investigations or examination of the situation were made, that apparently the Police were not informed and most importantly his parents were not informed. Thus as a fourteen year old he really had to deal with it alone and this would have been a devastating experience for him. He took quite drastic action with the aid of other students of setting up barriers with beds and bunks and lockers but slept for at least two years in a state of perpetual fear, waking up screaming and upset and senior boys and the Police were called on occasions. Obviously he experienced quite marked emotional distress at that time, made worse by what he claims was the somewhat off-hand neglectful attitude of the school but in particular of being told not to talk to anyone and he not having the support and comfort of his parents. 
         
        
        
         
         He mentioned he has received no counselling of any sort, either then or now. In your letter of February 10, 1999, you asked specifically whether counselling and other psychological assistance shortly after the assault would have assisted him. I have no doubt that if he received general and particular support from the school authorities, his family had been involved, there had been discussions about what happened, trying to ensure that his and others’ security and safety was protected, and some investigation carried out, he would have been at that time emotionally much more settled. Some form of counselling should have been offered and would have assisted him at that time in settling down the quite marked fears anxieties and depression he experienced then.  
         
        
        
         
         Also at that time he was distressed that because he and apparently others named [the fellow student], this boy was expelled. At the time he felt safer that he was expelled but felt even then that proper processes hadn’t been carried out. So the combination of the expulsion due to his statements and some guilt about this, together with the attitude of [the fellow student’s] brother who was in his class, was a cause of distress to him at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         What has caused his current feelings of anxiety, depression, guilt and responsibility has been the exposures over the last two years of the court actions against a teacher by [the fellow student]. As he himself said, this has given rise to a whole series of emotional reactions which are complex and difficult to explain. However, the mere fact that [the fellow student’s] name re-appeared within his consciousness, especially in these circumstances where there are allegations of an adult sexual predator in the school, is a cause of distress to him with a feeling of confusion as to who committed the assault on him and the effect that it all had on [the fellow student]. Thus he has had quite marked feelings of anxiety and depression stemming from revival of the feelings and distress associated with the incident and feelings of guilt and responsibility and fear in relation to [the fellow student]. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no doubt that the way he perceives the school authorities handled the matter at the time contributed to his present distress. Thus he is still unsure of what the circumstances were that led to [the fellow student’s] expulsion from the school and is unsure of whether this was in any way related to the accusations against the teacher, that there was no explanation given to him or his family regarding what happened to [the fellow student] or how the matter of his assault was investigated. This has led over the years, and particularly the last two years, to feelings of confusion, guilt and self-blame made worse by the revelations in regard to the case against the teacher by [the fellow student] and by the other boy who also wishes to bring a case against the teacher but was also expelled, thus sowing further doubt in his mind as to what extent this teacher may have played a part in the assault on him, either directly or due to the influence on the person who sexually assaulted him. 
         
        
        
         
         His emotional state is difficult both to elicit and to explain but there is no doubt he has had feelings of depression over the last two years or so, he feels confused and uncertain, he described problems in dealing with people and work and evidence that at least there are bouts of excessive drinking. I would make a diagnosis of adjustment reaction with depressed mood due to the events of many years ago and the thoughts and feelings that have been revived over the last two years as outlined above. 
         
        
        
         
         I believe he would benefit from counselling, talking over his thoughts and feelings and attitudes with someone over a period of time. Ideally once a week for four to six weeks, then fortnightly for two to three months, then monthly for about a year with further contact. If his depression deepens or becomes more severe he may need more vigorous treatment for the depression with support and counselling and anti-depressant medication. At this time I don’t think he specifically needs to see a Psychiatrist but if he did the cost would be between $110 to $150 per session. 
         
        
        
         
         It is difficult to make a judgement of the effect of his experience and emotional state on relationships, he has a sense of a lack of trust, feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty about his future which affects how he relates to people. 
         
        
        
         
         He is establishing his own business and feels that latterly there have been problems with concentration, difficulties in trusting people and he feels his business has been affected though not to a marked degree. Other activities continue and he feels that in his rugby coaching and involvement with people at rugby, that this is the best part of his life and he has no difficulty communicating there. 
         
        
        
         
         The prognosis is uncertain. I believe there needs to be resolution of these issues through this case and with counselling and of course there is the suggestion there is another case to be heard in relation to the teacher in question. Over time with support and help there should be a gradual settling of his depression though he is vulnerable to further emotional distress with further stress.” 
         
        
        
       The primary judge’s reasoning on ss 60G and 60I 
        
       
     30 It is not necessary to set out the primary judge’s reasoning on ss 60G and 60I in detail, because it is plain that that reasoning contained errors, as counsel for the opponent conceded, sufficient to justify interference with her exercise of discretion.  
      
       
     31 First, she devoted all her attention to whether s 60I(1)(a) was satisfied, and none to whether she should exercise the discretion conferred by s 60G. Yet s 60I does no more than set out preconditions to be established before the court can consider whether a s 60G order can be made. The failure to consider s 60G is an error of law.  
      
       
     32 Secondly, at the hearing before the primary judge counsel for the opponent expressly indicated that no reliance was being placed on s 60I(1)(a)(i) or (iii). Yet the primary judge’s reasons for judgment stated that the opponent was relying on s 60I(a)(iii) and that a number of the opponent’s arguments went to it. That is an error of fact revealing a misapprehension of the issues.  
      
       
     33 Thirdly, the primary judge on several occasions referred to “the conduct of the school in keeping quiet about the real culprit while telling the plaintiff not to talk about it” by describing this as “the school’s ‘trick’.” This was not a characterisation that could be supported either by the opponent’s affidavit (which used the word “tricked” but did not explain how the trick occurred), or by the opponent’s case as pleaded in the Statement of Claim. The primary judge’s references to the trick were thus errors of fact. 
      
       
     34 The primary judge’s discretionary decision to extend the limitation period was thus flawed. Since the matter does not turn on questions of credit, and since there is no other reason for the matter to be remitted to the District Court for the decision to be considered afresh by it, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the opponent’s application. 
      
       
        
       Section 60I(1)(a)(ii) and (b) 
        
       
     35 The question is whether the opponent has satisfied the court, first, that the opponent was unaware of the nature or extent of the personal injury he suffered on 16 December 1998 or a time before that date when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted, and, secondly, that the application was made within three years after the opponent became aware, or ought to have become aware, of the nature or extent of the personal injury. 
      
       
     36 The claimant submitted, first, that the question was not when the opponent became aware of “the technical name or description of an injury, but its effect, actual or potential, upon” him: CRA Ltd v Martignagno (1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 20; Harris v Commercial Minerals Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 1 at 12-13. Ignorance on the opponent’s part of the medical description or diagnosis of his condition did not establish unawareness of its nature and extent if he knew his own “signs and symptoms”: CRA Ltd v Martignagno (1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 20; Commonwealth of Australia v Nelson [2001] NSWCA 443 at [67]. 
      
       
     37 Secondly, the claimant submitted that the opponent was in a very similar position to Mr Nelson in the last mentioned case. In that case Rolfe AJA said (at [4]): 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Nelson was born on 27 December 1960 and joined the Royal Australian Navy in October 1976. On 1 March 1981, he was serving on a submarine, HMAS  
         Onslow, 
          which was participating in exercises off the New South Wales' coast. When the submarine descended to a greater depth, there was allegedly a malfunction causing diesel exhaust fumes from an engine to enter her. This reduced visibility to almost zero, and Mr Nelson inhaled fumes. Emergency procedures were put in place, but he collapsed and, after he and other members of the crew were rescued, he was admitted to hospital where he remained for two days.” 
         
        
        
       Three weeks later Mr Nelson was back at sea.  
        
       
     38 Rolfe AJA then said (at [58]-[60]): 
      
       
        
         
         “[Counsel] submitted, in my opinion correctly, that for more than 3 years prior to 6 November 1998, Mr Nelson had been aware of the nature and extent of the personal injuries from which he was suffering, and that they arose from the occurrence on 1 March 1981. In those circumstances the ‘label’ given to the conditions from which he was suffering did not assist a submission that he was unaware of either the nature or, more particularly, the extent, of the personal injury suffered. The contrary submission was that it was not until March 1997, when Mr Nelson read that Mr Bourke defined the condition as Post Traumatic Stress, that he became aware that he had a medical, as opposed to an emotional, condition and, accordingly, it was not until then that he became aware of the extent thereof.  
         
        
        
         
         The same medical condition may be described in somewhat different terms by different persons specialised in the field. In the present case, whilst Mr Bourke referred to the condition of Post Traumatic Stress, Dr Dinnen offered a diagnosis of Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder and Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I appreciate that Mr Nelson was not made aware of Dr Dinnen's diagnosis, and it would seem that the ‘medical name’ referred to in the letter from the Commonwealth of 8 December 1995, granting the pension for ‘Generalised Anxiety Disorder’, was taken from Dr Dinnen's report.  
         
        
        
         
         However one labelled the condition, Mr Nelson was clearly aware of all the symptoms from which he was suffering. That awareness dated back a number of years prior to 6 November 1995.” 
         
        
       
     39 Rolfe AJA then said (at [68]): 
      
       
        
         
         “In the instant case, Mr Nelson was aware of all the symptoms from which he was suffering. He had received psychological counselling and had seen a psychiatrist. There was no suggestion that the symptoms would become worse. The extent or limits of the condition from which Mr Nelson was suffering had been reached. In these circumstances, it seems to me, that his lack of knowledge that the problems could be described as Post Traumatic Stress did not in any way affect the extent of his personal injury. Rather, that was a way in which it could be described. However, as Clarke JA said, the Court is not concerned ‘with the technical name or description of an injury but its effect, actual and potential, upon the applicant’. It would be very strange if a person, aware of all the symptoms and in circumstances where there was no evidence that they would worsen, could say that he or she was not aware of their extent merely because different doctors may describe them differently.” 
         
        
       
     40 Rolfe AJA concluded (at [73]): 
      
       
        
         
         “The position, in the present case, is that Mr Nelson was aware of the various symptoms from which he suffered. He was aware that he had received some treatment. There was no suggestion that the condition would deteriorate, such that the symptoms from which he had been suffering for a long period would change or become worse, thus not enabling him to be aware of the ‘extent’ of his injury. The only new fact, which came to his attention, was that the symptoms, of which he was fully aware, were described by Mr Bourke as Post Traumatic Stress. He sought, thereupon, to draw a distinction between what he had thought was an emotional condition and a medical condition. However, whether one describes the condition as emotional or medical, the symptoms and effect upon him were the same, and there is certainly no suggestion that having been told that he was suffering, in the opinion of Mr Bourke, from Post Traumatic Stress, that he sought any further treatment or that his condition changed. In these circumstances it would be, in my opinion, fanciful to suggest that Mr Nelson was not aware of the extent of his injury for many years prior to November 1995, or that his becoming aware of Mr Bourke's report in any way had an effect upon the extent of the injury.” 
         
        
       
     41 Rolfe AJA then distinguished Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison (1995) 56 FCR 389 on the basis that it was not until the applicant in that case was examined by a Dr Dinnen “that he was made aware of the fact that he had a psychiatric injury, as opposed to physical injuries, from which he considered that he had suffered, and the existence of which caused understandable anxiety”: at [77]. 
      
       
     42 He said (at [78]-[79]): 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The distinction between that case and the present is that the trial Judge's finding was that the applicant had not been aware that he was suffering from any psychiatric injury until such time as he read the report of Dr Dinnen. However, in the present case, Mr Nelson was aware that he was suffering from an emotional state, and there was no evidence to suggest that there was any difference between that state and Post Traumatic Stress. Indeed, it was the condition from which he was suffering that constituted Post Traumatic Stress.  
         
        
        
         
         In the result, I am of the view that Mr Nelson was aware of all the symptoms from which he was suffering and, therefore, the extent of his personal injuries. The mere fact that he was not aware that those symptoms could be characterised as Post Traumatic Stress does not, conformably with the authorities to which I have referred, lead to the conclusion that he was unaware of the extent of the personal injuries. It would be, in my opinion, an extraordinary result if, having the awareness he did, he could nonetheless overcome the problems created by sub s (a)(ii) because doctors' views varied as to the way in which the problem was described.” 
         
        
       
     43 The claimant submitted that from the opponent’s affidavit and from Dr Morse’s report the following conclusions could be drawn: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) symptoms of emotional stress were suffered by Mr Stanley at the time of and immediately after the events of 1988; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) these symptoms were diagnosed by Dr Morse as ‘Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’; 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) over the two years prior to April 1999 when Dr Morse wrote his report, Mr Stanley had been suffering feelings of anxiety, depression and guilt; 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) these further feelings of anxiety, depression and guilt were diagnosed by Dr Morse as ‘adjustment reaction with depressed mood’; 
         
        
        
         
         (v) both the diagnosis of post traumatic stress and that of adjustment reaction with depressed mood were based on the symptoms, set out in the report, that had been described to Dr Morse by Mr Stanley; 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) the only matter of relevance of which Mr Stanley was not aware prior to receiving Dr Morse’s report was that those symptoms could be described or characterised as respectively post traumatic stress and an adjustment reaction with depressed mood; 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) there is in the present case, just as in  
         Nelson 
         , no evidence to suggest that there was any difference between the emotional state which Mr Stanley described to Dr Morse and, respectively, post traumatic stress and an adjustment reaction with depressed mood: as in  
         Nelson 
         , it was the condition or conditions so described that constituted those disorders; 
         
        
        
         
         (viii) again, just as in  
         Nelson 
         , there was no evidence suggesting that Mr Stanley’s condition would deteriorate, or had deteriorated since the expiration of the limitation period, so that the symptoms he described to Dr Morse would change or become worse, thus not enabling him to be aware of the extent of his injury; 
         
        
        
         
         (ix) there is no basis in the evidence for her Honour’s conclusion, at the top of page 7 of the judgment, that, having regard to the medical report, Mr Stanley had no insight into or understanding of the nature and extent of the injury suffered or the connection between the injury and the defendant’s acts and/or omissions until he saw the doctor in April 1999. No evidence was led from Mr Stanley in this regard. The only inference that is reasonably open on the extremely limited evidence offered by Mr Stanley regarding his awareness of the nature or extent of his injury is that the only ‘insight’ or ‘understanding’ which he lacked before reading Dr Morse’s report was the knowledge that his symptoms, that is his emotional state, could be described in the technical terms attributed to them by Dr Morse. Consistently with the decision of this Court in  
         Nelson 
         , this is insufficient to open the gateway presented by s 60G.” 
         
        
       
     44 Thus the claimant submitted that Dr Morse’s diagnosis that the opponent was suffering from “adjustment reaction with depressed mood” was simply the putting of a “medical label” on the symptoms, and did not alter the opponent’s understanding of the nature and effect of the symptoms experienced by the opponent. The claimant also submitted that the vagueness of Dr Morse’s report and the conclusion that it was not necessary for the opponent to receive psychiatric treatment, as distinct from counselling, made it impossible to conclude that Dr Morse had even diagnosed actionable psychiatric injury. To use the words of Clarke JA in CRA Ltd v Martignagno (1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 20, it could not be said that though the opponent may have been aware that he had suffered “an injury, possibly with continuing consequences”, he was “unaware of its complications, implications or potentially serious consequences” until he visited Dr Morse.  
      
       
     45 Counsel for the opponent first read the following passages from the reasons for judgment of Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Harris v Commercial Minerals Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 1 at 11-14: 
      
       
        
         
         “The ‘extent of an injury must include all its consequences. It is not an unnatural reading of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) to hold that what the court must consider is the total extent of the applicant's injury in determining whether, at the expiration of the limitation or earlier period, he or she was aware of the extent of the injury. Unless that construction is adopted, the Act will fail to provide for the very sort of case for which the legislation is designed to provide a remedy. That is to say, the case where the most serious consequences of an injury only arise after the expiration of the limitation period.  
         
        
        
         
         Thus in  
         The Commonwealth v Dinnison 
          [(1995) 56 FCR 389], although the applicant was aware during the limitation period that he had an anxiety state, it was only after the expiration of that period that he became aware that he had a psychiatric illness. Because of that fact, the Full Court of the Federal Court held that he was not aware of the extent of his injury. Similarly in  
         F J Walker Ltd v Webber 
          [unreported, 16 November 1989. This was a decision on the meaning of ‘the nature and extent of the personal injury’ in s 57(1)(b) of the Act], the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that, although the applicant knew that he had a disc lesion, he was unaware of ‘the extent’ of his injury because ‘he did not know it would or could lead to a surgical fusion or unfitness for work’ [ 
         F J Walker Ltd 
          (unreported; 16 November 1989), at 5]. 
         
        
        
         
         The better view of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) is that ‘the extent’ of the injury is to be determined as at the date of the application and not at the expiration of the limitation or earlier period. When the extent is so determined, the applicant must prove that, at the expiration of the limitation or earlier period, he or she was unaware that the injury was so extensive. As Clarke JA said in  
         CRA Ltd v Martignago 
          [(1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 20]: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            ‘The sub-section is concerned to inquire whether, in a real sense, the applicant knows the nature of his or her injury and its broad extent. Having regard to the policy of the legislation it is apparent that it is designed to afford relief to an applicant who is either unaware that he or she has suffered an injury or is aware that he or she has suffered an injury, possibly with continuing consequences, but is unaware of its complications, implications or potentially serious consequences. By way of example, an applicant who was aware that a blow on the arm had led to continuing but moderate pain but who was unaware until years later that there were serious complications flowing from that blow (eg osteomyelitis) would remain unaware of the extent of the injury until the complications and consequences were drawn to his or her attention.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His Honour went on to say [ 
         CRA Ltd 
          (1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 20-21]:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           The range of factual situations which may be encountered by the courts is so diverse that it would be overly optimistic and unwise, in my view, to attempt to provide a general formula by which the relevant inquiry may be answered. Rather courts should be concerned to analyse the facts in each case in order to determine whether the applicant knew the nature of the injury and, if so, in a broad way the extent of the injury, the nature of which is known. Practically speaking the resolution of the inquiry whether the applicant was unaware of the nature of the injury should throw considerable light on the task of resolving the second inquiry as to the extent of the injury. For instance, a finding that the applicant is aware that he or she has suffered a serious neck injury involving damage to the spine will, in general, provide an answer to the inquiries as to both nature and extent. In this context I would emphasise that the court is concerned not with the technical name or description of an injury but its effect, actual and potential, upon the applicant.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Expectation as to the likely consequences of an injury is clearly an element in determining an applicant's awareness of the extent of the injury. When the relevant injury is a disease, the expectation of the applicant at the expiration of the limitation period as to the likely course of the disease will usually be determinative of whether he or she was aware of ‘the extent’ of the disease for the purpose of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. In  
         Australian Iron & Steel Ltd v Connell  
         [(1959) 102 CLR 522 at 528]. Dixon CJ said that a disease was ‘a pathological condition importing pathological and physiological incidents and consequences and liable to follow a course or some or one of courses more or less known or expected’. But it is the applicant's expectation as to the course of the disease, not that of the reasonable person, that is relevant. Thus, if an applicant knew at the expiration of the relevant period that he or she suffered from a diseased spine, it does not necessarily follow that the person was aware of the ‘extent of personal injury’ if eventually the disease caused the vertebrae to collapse. Whether the applicant was aware of ‘the extent’ of the injury would depend on whether that person was aware that there was a real chance that the vertebrae would collapse as the result of the disease.  
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Ditchburn v Seltsam Ltd 
          [(1989) 17 NSWLR 697 at 704, per Kirby P, with whom Hope A-JA agreed. This was reaffirmed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in F J Walker Ltd (unreported, 16 November 1989)] the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that early signs and symptoms may not constitute sufficient indication of the ‘nature and extent’ of personal injury. In  
         F J Walker Ltd v Webber 
          [unreported; NSW Court of Appeal; 16 November 1989, at 4] the same Court also stated that:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘One can know `the nature and extent' of one's injury even if one is ignorant of the final form which it will take. Few plaintiffs ever know this, even at the time of trial, and it would be difficult to attribute to Parliament an intention that potential plaintiffs may completely disregard limitation periods merely because they are unable to predict their final state.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         These statements imply, correctly in our opinion, that an applicant may have been aware of the extent of his or her injury even though he or she does not expect all its precise consequences, for it is not necessary that the applicant should foresee the exact course of the disease or be aware of all its pathological and physiological incidents. If the applicant was aware that the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the injury for the purpose of s 60I(1)(a)(ii) even though the injury developed particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee. As long as the consequences are of a kind that an applicant expected to occur, the applicant will be aware of the extent of the injury. The nature or extent of the injury is not synonymous with the precise pathology or consequences of the injury. Thus, the New South Wales Court of Appeal has held that an applicant who knew that he had a disc lesion that caused him great pain and that the condition could only be alleviated by a spinal fusion was aware of ‘the extent’ of his injury although he was unaware ‘that his spinal cord nerves were caught in damaged discs’ [ 
         CRA Ltd 
          (1996) 39 NSWLR 13 at 21, per Clarke JA].” 
         
        
       
     46 Counsel for the opponent submitted that Dr Morse’s report revealed that the opponent had suffered from two psychiatric illnesses: post traumatic stress disorder beginning soon after the incidents in 1988 and lasting two years, and adjustment reaction with depressed moods more recently. Like the applicant in Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison (1995) 56 FCR 389, the opponent was aware before the limitation period expired that he had an anxiety state, but only after it had expired did he become aware that he had, and had had, a psychiatric illness. Counsel appealed to the example given by Clarke JA and quoted by the High Court of an applicant who was aware that a blow to the arm had caused moderate pain, but was unaware until years later of a serious complication like osteomyelitis. So here, said counsel, the opponent knew that for two years he was waking at night screaming and suffering constant fear, but he was unaware of the serious complication, namely the post traumatic stress disorder. To be aware of symptoms involving painful emotional responses was not equivalent to being aware that those symptoms were symptoms of a psychiatric illness.  
      
       
     47 While there may be no difference between experiencing neck pain and being informed that the cause is a disc lesion, there was a difference between experiencing fear and anger on the one hand and being informed that one has or had a psychiatric illness. 
      
       
     48 The opponent also submitted that while the opponent was merely experiencing symptoms, he did not know how long they would last, or what the true condition of his emotions and his mind was. He knew that he felt guilty, but not why. Only the diagnosis of psychiatric illness revealed these matters to him.  
      
       
     49 Counsel for the opponent then submitted that, contrary to the claimant’s submissions, Commonwealth of Australia v Nelson was distinguishable, and the case which was on all fours with the present case was Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison (1995) 56 FCR 389. He referred to the following passages. 
      
       
     50 At 398-9 Gummow and Cooper JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The primary judge found that the respondent, as a member of the Royal Australian Air Force, then aged 19, had attended and witnessed three atomic explosions at Maralinga in September and October 1957. The respondent had left the RAAF in January 1961. The primary judge said that although it was clear from the evidence that the respondent held and apparently still held the view that he suffered injury as a result of exposure to radiation, the case relied upon for the application was not one of radiation damage but of psychiatric damage, specifically the causing of a chronic and disabling anxiety state.” 
         
        
       
     51 They then said at 399: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour [the primary judge, Foster J] referred to the evidence of the respondent that whilst he was in the RAAF he had begun to experience dreams which were apparently related to his witnessing the third blast. The dreams occurred on average about once a week and had commenced two or three years after the respondent left Maralinga. They had resulted in a disturbed sleeping pattern. The primary judge continued:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           I consider that this evidence and other evidence is capable of establishing that the applicant took from aspects of his service in Maralinga, culminating in his exposure to the shock of the third atomic blast, a deep seated fear that he had been affected by radiation and was a potential candidate for cancer. It is at least reasonably arguable that whilst he was still in the airforce, this condition of fear manifested itself in dreams and in disturbed sleep.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           After he left the airforce, this fear appears to have been fed by a number of events. Whilst working in the Snowy Mountains in 1961, he spoke to an ex-serviceman from Japan, who provided him with some frightening information as to the effect of the Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion upon those unfortunate Japanese people who had been exposed to it. The information he received was that `people who were as close to the bomb on Hiroshima as I was at the bomb at Maralinga were all riddled with cancer or they had this bone problem, bone marrow problem and that and lots of other defects of their body that caused death'. He said of this information `that really shook me up a fair bit'.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           His evidence appears to indicate that the receipt of information of this kind would revive or increase his sleeping problems until its effect would subside. It did not cause the problem, but temporarily added to it. The Snowy Mountains informant `sort of put a bit more on top of it when I met him'."" 
           
          
         
        
       
     52 Counsel for the opponent said that what happened to Mr Dinnison was “very very similar” to what happened to the opponent – “Where you have an initial condition then you have exacerbations when events occur which remind the sufferer of the particular problem”.  
      
       
     53 In Commonwealth of Australia v Dinnison there was evidence that the respondent was aware he had physical problems, summarised thus in a letter of 23 January 1987 from the Department of Defence (at 400): 
      
       
        
         
         “I refer to your claim for compensation in respect of ‘teeth became loose and had to be removed – very bad eyesight – passing of blood – poor hearing – anxiety – troubled uneasy and concerned from exposure to radiation.” 
         
        
       
     54 Gummow and Cooper JJ then said (at 400-401): 
      
       
        
         
         “To his affidavit in support of the present application, the respondent annexed a copy of a report by Dr Anthony Dinnen, consultant psychiatrist, dated 4 May 1993, and continued (par 42):  
          
          
           
           ‘Until I was given the report of Dr Dinnen I was not aware of any medical evidence that would support my claim against the Commonwealth.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In his report Dr Dinnen gave the following opinion:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘This patient is suffering from a chronic anxiety state as a result of his experiences at Maralinga during the atomic testing in 1957. His involvement with Aborigines at that time has much affected his life, and coloured his experiences. He perceives that his general health has been adversely affected by his exposure to radiation at Maralinga.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The primary judge expressed as follows his conclusions:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Obviously, the case sought to be presented may well be beset with difficulties. However, I think sufficient has been put forward to support a claim on behalf of the [respondent] that he was unreasonably exposed to nervous shock from the third atomic blast and that that exposure foreseeably set in train the development of an anxiety state ... I consider ... that if he is not otherwise statute barred, the applicant has shown the existence of a case capable of being brought.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          ...  
          
          
         In this case, it is unnecessary to identify with precision when the relevant limitation period expired as this would have occurred many years ago. In my view, it is sufficiently demonstrated that it was not until the applicant was examined by Dr Dinnen that  
         he was made aware of the fact that he had any psychiatric injury, as opposed to the physical injuries 
         , from which he considered that he suffered. He was previously unaware of the  
         fact, nature, or extent of the anxiety state 
          which Dr Dinnen diagnosed.’ [Emphasis supplied.]” 
         
        
        
       The opponent stressed the words which Gummow and Cooper JJ emphasised at the end of the passage quoted from the primary judge.  
        
       
     55 Gummow and Cooper JJ continued (401): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Commonwealth takes issue with the statement by the primary judge to the effect that whilst previously aware of his alleged physical injuries, the respondent was only aware of ‘the fact’ that he had any psychiatric injury after the report by Dr Dinnen in 1993.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the opponent said this was the precise point which the claimant was taking in the present case and which the Full Federal Court rejected in  
       Dinnison’s 
        case. 
        
       
     56 Gummow and Cooper JJ then said (at 401): 
      
       
        
         
         “The submission by the Commonwealth is that given the state of knowledge and awareness manifested by the making of the respondent's claim for compensation and supported by what he later conceded in cross-examination, the order under s 60G was made in error. This is said to be because the primary judge could not properly have been satisfied that the respondent, at the relevant dates before the expiration of the limitation period, or a time before then when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted, (i) did not know that he had suffered personal injury or (ii) was unaware of the nature and extent of that personal injury.  
         
        
        
         
         The Commonwealth submits that the claim by the respondent for compensation in respect, among other things, of ‘anxiety’, the subject of the letter from the Department of Defence dated 23 January 1987, which was passed on to his solicitors before the writ and statement of claim were drawn and filed in 1988, is a significant matter and one not noted by the primary judge in his reasons. The letter recites the claim received as one not only in respect of teeth, eyesight, passing of blood and poor hearing, but also ‘anxiety — troubled, uneasy and concerned from exposure to radiation’.” 
         
        
       
     57 The next passages relied on were as follows (402-403): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is important to appreciate, as did the primary judge, that the personal injury, the suffering of which Mr Dinnison alleged he did not know, or was unaware as to its nature or extent, was a psychiatric illness. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The respondent's oral evidence and the documentary material to which we have referred certainly is capable of supporting the proposition that from aspects of his service at Maralinga, culminating in exposure to the shock of the third atomic blast, the respondent derived a deep seated fear that he had been affected by radiation, which condition of fear manifested itself in dreams and in disturbed sleep. This state of affairs might be accurately described, as it was, in his claim for compensation as ‘anxiety — troubled, uneasy and concerned about exposure to radiation’. But, in our view, the primary judge, in a passage set out earlier in these reasons, correctly emphasised the importance of awareness by the respondent that his anxiety amounted to psychiatric illness.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the opponent stressed the last sentence, said it was the ratio of the case, and said “it was the thrust” of the position advanced on behalf of the opponent.  
        
       
     58 Gummow and Cooper JJ concluded (at 403): 
      
       
        
         
         “There was, in the evidence before the primary judge, in our view, sufficient to support a finding that within the meaning of s 60I(1)(a)(i) the respondent, at the relevant time, did not know that personal injury, being an anxiety state amounting to an illness, had been suffered by him. Even if that be not so, then within the meaning of subpar (ii) there was sufficient support for the finding that the respondent was unaware of the nature or extent of the illness. It should be noted that the paragraph uses the phrase ‘the nature or extent’. The result is that even if there is awareness of the real nature of the personal injury, there may be a lack of awareness as to the extent thereof. Put at its very lowest, awareness of the extent of the illness only followed the diagnosis by Dr Dinnen.” 
         
        
       
     59 In short, counsel for the opponent drew an analogy between Mr Dinnison, who knew he was anxious but not that this was significant – that his anxiety amounted to an illness, and the opponent, who knew he was suffering distress and fear, but not that this amounted to two illnesses.  
      
       
     60 Counsel for the opponent said that Commonwealth of Australia v Nelson was distinguishable for the following reasons. First, Mr Nelson, unlike the opponent, had attempted suicide. Secondly, Mr Nelson, unlike the opponent, had been treated by a psychologist – for almost two years. Thirdly, Mr Nelson, unlike the opponent, had made a claim on the defendant for what were specifically described by him as “anxiety attacks”, had been granted a pension for what he had been told was “generalised anxiety disorder”, and experienced “panic attacks” occurring two or three times and later six or seven times per day. Fourthly, Mr Nelson, unlike the opponent, had mood swings which were bad enough to be noticed by his wife, had bad dreams every night, and was violent to his wife. In short, as the Court in Nelson’s case found, while Mr Nelson was aware he was suffering from an emotional state no different from the “Post Traumatic Stress” later diagnosed, Mr Dinnison was unaware he was suffering from any psychiatric injury until he read Dr Dinnen’s report. Counsel for the opponent submitted that while Mr Nelson, who was aware he had suffered the symptoms described for about sixteen years and had been seeing a psychologist for two years, must have been aware that he had a psychiatric problem, Mr Dinnison and the opponent did not.  
      
       
     61 Counsel for the opponent submitted that when the third incident happened, he screamed: he was thirteen at the time, he was a boarder isolated from his family, and it was a significant and not a trivial event. He was told by the housemaster not to tell anyone about what had happened and bottled it up for nine years until 1997, even though he was “extremely upset”: he did not tell his parents because he was embarrassed and feared they would believe the incident was his fault. He suffered “fear, anxiety and depression”, would wake up screaming, would often be under his dormitory bunk, and was scared he would be assaulted again while asleep. He felt betrayed by the fact that he could not tell his parents.  
      
       
     62 Counsel for the opponent submitted that the emotions which the opponent experienced while thirteen, fourteen and fifteen years of age did not betoken any awareness that he was suffering any kind of illness: he was not to have imputed to him the knowledge of an adult. Counsel for the opponent submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The point I am getting at is whatever happened has just been bottled up inside this young person and its origins are when he is 13 and it’s a bit much to say when you are 22 or 23 you are immediately cathartically released from this when this sort of background has occurred.”  
         
        
       
     63 Counsel for the opponent submitted that a new factor arose:  
      
       
        
         
         “there is apparently another player who may or may not have had anything to do with this, but it’s interesting that the student that he thought was responsible claimed to have been assaulted by this particular master. What that does is no more but no less than this, suddenly what unpleasant and all that was appeared to be fairly straightforward. Now what intrudes on what must have been an extraordinarily distressing event which had been kept within him for years is the fact perhaps I did the wrong thing. So that guilt feeling that I referred your Honours to earlier which affects so often victims of this situation is now added to by the fact perhaps he was innocent, perhaps it wasn’t him. We don’t know whether it was. It doesn’t matter whether it was or not. Now you have got the intrusion I have been unfair, I have done the wrong thing. And that’s imposed on what’s been bubbling away there somewhere unreleased, if you like, for some nine years.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       In fact there was no evidence that the school had played any trick on him, but he believed it had.  
        
        
         
         “Then he finds out that my belief for nine years may not have been correct, there may have been something else going on, and with all the paranoia which is encouraged these days outside, you know, conspiracy theories, there is another player, perhaps my belief was wrong, perhaps the school knew more, perhaps this master was involved. All these things are occurring, they are occurring in his mind but that is just as relevant to this consideration as if they were real.” 
         
        
       
     64 Counsel for the opponent submitted that Dr Morse’s description of the opponent’s agitation, tenseness, tearfulness and distress, and his inability to explain these phenomena, was “very poignant”: the opponent showed no “insight as to the nature and extent of his condition” and “could not “even articulate it”.  
      
       
        
         
         “What he is doing is he is describing his confusion, his upset, these conflicting emotions. It’s a cry for help. It’s not an insightful analysis such as Mr Nelson carried out after 16 years of experiencing the sort of problems he had and seeking expert help. That’s an extraordinarily pithy description of what the problem is here and it is not one which displays or demonstrates knowledge of the nature and extent of the injury.” 
         
        
         
       
     65 Further, counsel for the opponent submitted that the concluding paragraphs of Dr Morse’s report revealed “a maelstrom of emotion, … not insightful knowledge”. Dr Morse found that his “emotional state is difficult both to elicit and to explain”: if so, said counsel for the opponent, how can it be said he’s aware of the nature and extent of the problem”?  
      
       
     66 In reply counsel for the claimant drew attention to the following evidence given by Mr Dinnison in cross-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am not suggesting you were overjoyed at all, Mr Dinnison, all I am suggesting to you is that you knew very well that you had had — because you had told Dr Dinnen, that you had had those various concerns for, according to you, for quite a number of years? — Yes, I also might add too that I was pretty surprised when an appointment was made for me to go to see a psychiatrist.  
         
        
        
         
         It was the first time that this had ever happened to you, had it? — I didn't think I was — I needed psychiatry treatment, you know."" 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the claimant said that that was a point of distinction between  
       Dinnison’s  
       case and  
       Nelson’s 
        case: Mr Dinnison was unaware that he was suffering from any psychiatric injury until he read Dr Dinnen’s report, whereas Mr Nelson was. Counsel for the claimant said that the opponent was in the same position as Mr Nelson, because he told Dr Morse that when he went to see Dr Morse he had already decided to take legal action; he had already consulted solicitors; it was they who had directed him to Dr Morse; the only possible legal action could relate to psychological injury; and hence he cannot have been surprised to have been told that he had a psychological injury. 
        
       
     67 The question whether the opponent was unaware of the nature or extent of the personal injury suffered on 17 December 1998 is a difficult one. The opponent was not cross-examined, and it cannot be inferred, in the absence of any admissions in cross-examination by the opponent, that when he went to Dr Morse he already knew he had suffered from or was suffering from psychological or psychiatric illnesses to an extent sufficient to answer what is meant by the words “personal injury” in s 60I(1)(a)(ii). His visit to Dr Morse is equally compatible with ignorance about that question, but a desire to find an answer to it. His decision to start proceedings could be explained by the fact that one of the cases propounded in the Statement of Claim – though an ill pleaded case, very likely to fail, and very unlikely to produce much in the way of damages -was that the claimant’s negligence permitted the fellow student to commit batteries on him which a careful system would have prevented.  
      
       
     68 The arguments of counsel for the opponent based on the way in which the opponent presented to Dr Morse have considerable force. Putting aside any question of feigned behaviour, of which there is no evidence, the opponent does seem to have behaved like someone who was confused, incapable of articulating his feelings, not having any insight into his symptoms, and unable to explain his emotions of guilt. An adult with those feelings might perceive them to be the symptoms of an illness, or might only perceive them to be the signs of some personal weakness or defect falling short of an illness. While children or young adults can infer a physical injury from physical symptoms relatively easily, it is far harder to infer psychological illness from particular feelings. That is a field well outside ordinary comprehension. An inference is fairly open that the opponent was aware of signs and symptoms in his condition, but not that they revealed any “personal injury”. His very inability to explain his distress and his feelings of guilt suggest that he thought his condition was the result of some personal inadequacy, as distinct from a more serious condition amounting to “personal injury”. There is a close analogy between the opponent and Mr Dinnison rather than Mr Nelson.  
      
       
     69 Hence s 60I(1)(a)(ii) is satisfied. In the present circumstances, it follows that s 60I(2) is also satisfied. 
      
       
        
       The s 60G discretion 
        
       
     70 The claimant submitted, against the background of the lapse of more than eleven years since the alleged incidents, that there were four reasons why the court should exercise its discretion under s 60G against the opponent. 
      
       
     71 The first was that the opponent could have seen an appropriate medical adviser before 17 December 1998. 
      
       
     72 The second was that even if the opponent’s awareness of his condition was not complete, it was so extensive as not to make it just or reasonable to extend the limitation period. 
      
       
     73 The third is that prejudice to the claimant could be presumed from the passing of time – the damage it was likely to have caused to the memories of the school staff and indeed the opponent. 
      
       
     74 The fourth turned on the weaknesses of the opponent’s case. In the claimant’s argument in chief, the weaknesses were said to be of two kinds. The first related to the extremely vague, loose, improbable and exaggerated character of some of the allegations in the Statement of Claim. Particulars (a) and (i) illustrate improbability and exaggeration. Almost every particular of negligence illustrates vagueness and looseness. The second category of weakness relied on centred on inconsistencies between the Statement of Claim, the opponent’s affidavit, and the history as recorded by Dr Morse. Thus the Statement of Claim did not mention the recent discovery of the news about the master who was charged, though the affidavit and the report did. The details about the master being charged differed as between the affidavit and the report. The report said that the feelings of the opponent in part arose because the police were not informed, whereas the affidavit said that they were informed, and had taken a statement from the opponent. The Statement of Claim complained that the fellow student had not been removed. The affidavit and the history suggested vaguely that the opponent felt guilty because the fellow student had been removed. The Statement of Claim appeared to indicate that the opponent had positively identified the fellow student as the assailant; the affidavit did not; the history recorded that the opponent “feels” it was the fellow student. The affidavit, however, suggested that it was the opponent’s present belief that the assailant was the fellow student, even though other material appeared to suggest that the opponent was contending it may have been the teacher later prosecuted. The opponent’s written submissions to this Court contended that in late 1997 the opponent “was given information which led him to believe that he had been tricked by the school into accusing wrongfully a fellow student whereas in fact the perpetrator had been a teacher”. The affidavit is much less specific than this; the Statement of Claim is silent. Yet another proposition suggested by some parts of the material but not other parts was that the teacher’s treatment of the fellow student may have caused the fellow student to assault the opponent. There is force in all these criticisms turning on the contrast between the Statement of Claim, the affidavit and the report.  
      
       
     75 However, the scene changed when counsel for the opponent addressed orally, though the changes had been foreshadowed by one or two remarks made by him while counsel for the claimant addressed. Counsel for the opponent was highly critical of the Statement of Claim. He said it was “appallingly drafted”, was “improperly pleaded”, revealed draftsmanship that could not be defended and was “appalling”. He said it would take talents beyond his “to rehabilitate that document in the form in which it’s currently pleaded”. He said the case based on the theory that the claimant should have prevented the three incidents occurring was abandoned: it was “difficult to see how” the claimant could have stopped them. The real case advanced was that, once the incidents occurred, the claimant had failed to deal with the aftermath in a non-negligent way.  
      
       
     76 One consequence of the changed case was that neither Dr Morse’s report nor the plaintiff’s affidavit nor any other evidence was directed to the following vital questions: 
      
       
        
       (a) What standards would a non-negligent school in the claimant’s position reasonably have adopted in 1988 in dealing with the aftermath of the assaults? Without some evidence of those standards – and it is far from self-evident what they might have been – there would be no evidence of breach of duty.  
        
        
       (b) What different effect on the opponent would there have been if, assuming that the three incidents did take place, he had been treated as he ought to have been treated compared to the way he was treated? Without some evidence of that, which is again far from self-evident, there could be no evidence of causation or damage. 
        
       
     77 Dr Morse did say that counselling and family involvement would have assisted the plaintiff, but the extent of the difference this would have made is hard to estimate. Dr Morse wrote a short supplementary report on 9 November 2001. In it he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not consider that the lack of medical treatment at the time of the assault nor the lack of medical treatment at this time has materially impeded my ability to assess Mr Stanley and the effect of the assault.” 
         
        
        
       In view of the change in the nature of the opponent’s case, that evidence of Dr Morse does not achieve a necessary purpose. It may be presumed, as the claimant submitted, that the claimant will have suffered prejudice from the passing of time in that the recollections of its witnesses will have faded. Another possible type of prejudice is whether the ability of medical experts to assess the effect of the difference on the opponent between the treatment the claimant gave him and that which it ought to have given him has been materially impeded by delay. Dr Morse was not asked to say anything about that. What he did say was not directed to that question. 
        
       
     78 The court’s discretion under s 60G should be exercised against the opponent for the following reasons. 
      
       
     79 First, the deficiencies in the case as pleaded and the evidence filed in support of the application are so great as to suggest that it has little prospects of success, whether it is propounded in the form of the Statement of Claim or in the different form outlined in oral argument. 
      
       
     80 Secondly, there is no evidence to suggest key elements of the rather speculative case which the opponent now desires to advance (namely, what standards of counselling were appropriate in 1988 and whether they would have prevented injury), and considerable prejudice is likely to have enured to the claimant by reason of the lapse of time. In particular, there may be difficulties in assembling evidence now of what standards were appropriate in 1988 which is untainted by knowledge of what the most recent standards are.  
      
       
     81 Thirdly, Dr Morse’s view was that any injury which the opponent has suffered is not so great that he presently needed psychiatric treatment and that some counselling sufficed. 
      
       
     82 Fourthly, the opponent’s own counsel, who is extremely experienced in all types of personal injury litigation, conceded that though his client’s claim was “real” and “serious”, “not by any stretch a hopeless case”, it was “not big” – “it’s a small claim.” In short, even if the claim succeeded, which is highly questionable in view of the contradictory nature of the evidence and the gaps in the way it is formulated, it would not result in damages of any significance. That is supported by the fact that despite the complaints he makes, the opponent has had quite a successful life. He told Dr Morse that he ran “his own legal investigation business”. He achieved an ambition which thousands of young men have but which relatively few achieve, namely playing first grade rugby union football. Though injury has curtailed his career, he is active in coaching. These facts negate the allegations in the particulars that he “has been restricted in a wide range of work, sports, social and hobbying activities” and that he “has been restricted in his ability to earn on the open labour market and claims in respect of a diminution of earning capacity”.  
      
       
     83 In all the circumstances, taking into account the interests of both parties, it would not be just and reasonable to exercise the court’s discretion to extend the limitation period in the manner desired by the opponent. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     84 It follows that leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed, the respondent’s Notice of Application to Commence Proceedings dated 10 August 1999 should be dismissed, and the orders of Gibson DCJ extending the time to commence the proceedings to 14 December 2001 should be set aside. It also follows that the respondent should pay the appellant’s costs of the application for leave to appeal and of the appeal, but should receive a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 if qualified. The draft Notice of Appeal did not seek any order varying the costs orders made in the District Court, and in all the circumstances this Court should not vary them. 
      
       
     85 The following orders are proposed: 
      
       
        
       1. On condition that the appellant files a Notice of Appeal and pays the filing fee: 
        
        
        (a) leave to appeal is granted; 
        
        
        (b) the appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       2. The respondent’s Notice of Application to Commence Proceedings dated 10 August 1999 is dismissed. 
        
        
       3. The order of Gibson DCJ extending the time to commence the proceedings to 14 December 2001 is set aside. 
        
        
       4. The respondent is to pay the appellant’s costs of the application for leave to appeal and of the appeal, but is to have a certificate under the  
       Suitors Fund Act 
        1951 if entitled.  
        
       
     86 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Heydon JA, and substantially with his reasons. 
      
       
     87 The events the subject of the proposed claim occurred in 1988. The present Statement of Claim was filed in November 1999. At the hearing of this application for leave, Senior Counsel for the opponent foreshadowed a new Statement of Claim seeking damages for injury caused by the school’s unsatisfactory response to the assaults on the opponent. No draft Statement of Claim was submitted. 
      
       
     88 As pointed out by Heydon JA, there is no evidence to enable the Court to come even to a prima facie view as to what response to the assaults reasonable skill and care would have required in 1988. If it be assumed that the exercise of such skill and care would have made the difference of providing counselling and family involvement, then Dr. Morse’s report provides some evidence that this would have resulted in a better outcome; but it remains speculative as to whether the exercise of reasonable skill and care would have made just this difference, and more generally as to what would have been the outcome for the mental state of the opponent if reasonable skill and care had been exercised in dealing with the opponent’s complaints. For example, would this have led to some different treatment of the other student at the time, or of the teacher who was later alleged to have assaulted him; and if so, what then? 
      
       
     89 Since this Court is exercising the discretion given by s.60G of the Limitation Act, the opponent bears the onus of showing that it is just and reasonable to grant an extension; and for this the opponent must show not merely that there is a case with substantial merit, but also that the delay has not made the chance of a fair trial unlikely. Having regard to the likely problems in ascertaining the truth about a complicated and highly contentious fact situation occurring in 1988, and in evaluating alternative psychological outcomes for the opponent arising out of different scenarios occurring at that time, in my opinion the presumptive prejudice to the claimant from the delay is high in this case. I am not satisfied that the delay has not made the chance of a fair trial unlikely. 
      
       
     90 Accordingly, the extension of time should be refused.

      REGINA v. WILLIAM CHARLES BOND 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the accused, William Charles Bond, who had pleaded guilty to murder before me on 29 May 2002 to withdraw that plea. 
     
      
    2 In support of the application there has been filed the affidavit of Timothy John Heenan sworn 27 August 2002 and Exhibit 1, a psychiatric report dated 20 August 2002 from Dr. Bruce Westmore. 
     
      
    3 On 29 May 2002, I remanded the applicant in custody for submissions on sentence. Subsequently on the application of the applicant's senior counsel, the matter was adjourned from time to time until it was re-listed before me today for the purpose of this application. 
     
      
    4 The learned Crown Prosecutor informs me that there is no objection to any of the material upon which the applicant relies, nor is there any challenge to any of the matters asserted in that material. Further, that it is the attitude of the Crown that the application is not opposed, although not consented to. I am informed that the Crown accepts there is an arguable basis of defence and at the time of the plea was informed of the accused's counsel's reservations. 
     
      
    5 It is expressly conceded by the learned Crown Prosecutor that the situation with which I now have to deal is not that considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61 or in Regina v. Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97. Both of the those cases were concerned with an examination by a Court of Criminal Appeal of a trial judge's decision not to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty made during a trial. Those pleas necessarily attracted the operation of s.91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which section provides by subsection (1) that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the event of a person wishing to plead 'guilty' to an offence at any time after having been given in to the charge of a jury and the court accepting the plea, the court is to discharge the jury from giving a verdict and the court is to find the accused person guilty of the offence. Section 81(2) provides the finding has effect as if it were the verdict of a jury and the accused person is liable to punishment accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    6 It was held in those decisions that following the formal entry of that finding or verdict the trial judge has no power to permit the plea to be withdrawn. 
     
      
    7 The position prevailing under s 91 is not unlike that which prevailed at Common Law as is referred to in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen v. Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218. See also Regina v. Mitchell (NSWCCA, unreported 25 July 1995). 
     
      
    8 The test to be applied on an application for withdrawal of a plea has been variously expressed. It is referred to in some detail in a series of numbered propositions enunciated by the Chief Justice in Hura (supra). Clearly it is important when considering whether the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt is impugned that there be reference to the necessity for the accused to have the relevant understanding such that the accused is able to reason with some degree of composure concerning his situation and the proper course he might take in relation to the making of the plea and the giving of instructions. That is, of course, a corollary to his having that necessary degree of composure and understanding to enable him to appreciate and make a reasoned decision about the legal advice he might receive. 
     
      
    9 An illustration of a circumstance in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has held that it would be appropriate to allow an accused to withdraw the plea for lack of such understanding is afforded in the decision in Regina v. Iral [1999] NSWCCA 368 in which the Court adopted the views of Badgery-Parker, J. expressed in the Court of Criminal Appeal, views with which the other members of the court agreed in Regina v. David Lloyd Davies (CCA, unreported 16 December 1993). 
     
      
    10 In the present matter, Dr. Westmore refers to a number of matters in the history of the applicant which the applicant told him had operated upon his mind at the time of entering the plea. Dr. Westmore refers to the applicant as being subjected to considerable psychological stress. Dr. Westmore refers to matters which indicate that the applicant was indeed in circumstances at that time such that his will and ability to reason so as to choose rationally the course he might take might well be said to be entirely overborne. That view is borne out by the material contained in the affidavit of Mr. Heenan and in particular where Mr. Heenan gives evidence concerning what the applicant said as to his reason for entering a plea. 
     
      
    11 There is consistency between what was said to the legal advisors and what was said to the psychiatrist. I apprehend, there being no challenge from the Crown, that I can safely proceed upon the basis that those matters are established. 
     
      
    12 In those circumstances I am of the view that the proper order I should make is to permit the applicant to withdraw the plea of guilty to the charge of murder and vacate that plea. That leaves the applicant liable to re-arraignment and in due course for trial, if necessary. It will be necessary then for the matter to return to the arraignment list and I note that the next date for that list is 6 September 2002. 
     
      
    13 I have expressed my reasons for the course that I have undertaken in this way to ensure that the publication of those reasons will not cause the consequence that might otherwise have followed a fuller exposition of the matter and would not embarrass future proceedings. In that regard, I note that I had made an order suppressing publication of the matters referred to in the solicitor's affidavit and the psychiatrist's report. 
     
      
    14 I permit the withdrawal of the plea and re-list the matter in the arraignment list on 6 September 2002.

      R v Stephen Patrick Farrell 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
    1 His Honour: On 26 August 2002, I held an inquiry pursuant to s12 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act) as to whether the accused, Stephen Patrick Farrell, is fit to be tried in respect of a charge pending against him, namely, that on 1 June 2001, at Warrawee, in the state of New South Wales, he did murder Bernadette Farrell.  
     
      
    2 I noted the determination by the Solicitor General as delegate of the Attorney General, made pursuant to s8 of the Act, that an inquiry be conducted as to whether the accused is fit or unfit to be tried in respect of the offence. Insofar as it may have been necessary, I was satisfied pursuant to s10(2) of the Act, that the question of fitness had been raised in good faith.  
     
      
    3 I noted the election of the accused that the question of fitness be determined by a judge alone. In reliance on a report by Dr B Westmore, psychiatrist, dated 8 August 2002, I was satisfied that the accused had the capacity to make the election. I was further satisfied, for the purposes of s11A, that the accused had sought and received advice in relation to the election from his solicitor, Mr Giddy.  
     
      
    4 The reasons for my finding that the accused is unfit to be tried for the offence with which he is charged are as follows. 
     
      
    5 The facts which give rise to the charge appear as follows from a police facts sheet tended in evidence. 
     
      
       
        
        About 5.15am on Friday 1st June 2001 the mother of the Defendant and victim was awoken by the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, “Dad, Bernadette’s in big trouble”. He then left and walked to his own room. The mother then walked to the defendant’s room and asked him what was wrong. He said, “She’s in big trouble”. 
        
       
       
        
        The mother then walked to victim’s room and saw the victim laying on her back on the bed with an amount of blood on the sheets. The victim was pale but still conscious. The victim said, “I’ve rung an ambulance”. The victim then made gasping noises. The mother then returned to the defendant’s room. he looked at his mother and said, “I’m sorry”. 
        
       
       
        
        During this time the father, Allan FARRELL entered the victims bedroom and saw her on the bed. He said, “What happened?”. The victim replied Stephen stabbed me”. 
        
       
       
        
        Alan FARRELL then turned his daughter over and saw a large wound to the right side of her back that was bleeding freely. Both parents then commenced CPR on the victim. The parents saw a kitchen knife of the bed near the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Police arrived a short time later and the defendant was arrested. Ambulance personnel also arrived and commenced treating the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Police asked the defendant where the knife was and he stated, “It is still in the room”. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was conveyed to Hornsby Police station and entered into custody. The victim was pronounced life extinct at Hornsby Hospital at 6.35am. The treating doctor estimated that the victim had lost 2.5 litres of blood as a result of her injury. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant refused to be interviewed on the advice of his solicitor.  
        
       
      
    6 The principles relating to the question of unfitness to be tried are sufficiently stated in two decisions. In Dennison (CCA (NSW), 3 March 1988, unreported), the following was held. 
     
      
       
        
        The question of unfitness turns upon an evaluation of the capacity of the prisoner concerned at the trial to understand the proceedings, to be able to commence instructions, to be able to formulate his plea to the charge against him, and to follow to a sufficient extent what is actually taking place in the trial. 
        
       
      
    7 The test for unfitness to be tried was described as follows in Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. 
     
      
       
        
        It is whether the accused because of mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs … to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand the purpose of all of the various court formality. He needs to be able to understand … the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; he needs to be able to make his defence or answer the charge. Where he has Counsel he needs to be able to do this through his Counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his Counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence but he must … have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his Counsel, if any. 
        
       
      
    8 The onus of proof does not rest on any particular party: s12. The question of unfitness is to be determined on the balance of probabilities: s6.  
     
      
    9 The psychiatric evidence tendered included reports by Dr A Samuels, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the accused, dated 30 January 2002 and 12 July 2002, Dr B Westmore, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the accused, dated 12 December 2001 and 23 July 2002, and Dr Y Skinner, psychiatrist retained on behalf of the Crown, dated 19 March 2002.  
     
      
    10 Dr Skinner’s opinion was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        Stephen Farrell suffers from Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia. It has been suggested that he might have suffered a drug-induced psychosis. However, he has been in the prison hospital where he is presumably unable to access drugs and alcohol, and he continues to suffer severe psychotic symptoms characteristic of a schizophrenic illness. He has no insight into the fact that he suffers from a mental illness or that his beliefs are delusional. 
        
       
       
        
        I consider that he was suffering from severe mental illness at the time that he allegedly stabbed his sister. I consider that he had delusional beliefs about his sister and acted on those beliefs at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Farrell is not fit to plead and to stand trial. He is intelligent and educated and has a good understanding of the functions of the officers of the court and of the legal proceedings. However, I do not think that he would reasonably be able to decide on entering a plea to the charge, because he believes that his sister is not dead and that his actions did not cause her any injury. 
        
       
       
        
        He would not be able to give reasonable and considered instructions to his solicitor with respect to his defence. He does not believe that he suffers from a mental illness; therefore, he would not be able to properly consider the possibility of having a defence of mental illness. He remembers the events surrounding the alleged offences. However, his description of what happened and his explanations are affected by his delusional beliefs. 
        
       
       
        
        He was obviously distressed when talking to me about the alleged offences. He continues to suffer symptoms of mental illness and I believe it is probable that his condition would be aggravated by the trial process. Therefore I believe that he is not fit to plead and to stand trial. 
        
       
      
    11 The opinions of Dr Samuels and Dr Westmore on the question of fitness to be tried were materially to the same effect.  
     
      
    12 Having regard to the psychiatric evidence, and the legal principles which apply, I was satisfied that the accused is unfit to be tried for the offence with which he is charged. 
     
      
    13 Pursuant to s14, I made the mandatory order referring the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. No further order was sought on behalf of the Crown or the accused.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 7 October 1999, the respondent was charged with an offence under s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cwth), namely that she: 
      
       
        
         
         On 7 October 1999, at Sydney, New South Wales did import into Australia prohibited imports to which Section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. 
         
        
       
     2 On that day, she had arrived at Sydney Airport on a flight from Bali, carrying 8,282 tablets of the substance MDMA, commonly known as Ecstasy, amounting to almost double the commercial quantity of MDMA and having a street value estimated to be about $400,000.00. 
      
       
     3 On 22 March 2000, the respondent entered a plea of guilty before Downing Centre Local Court, and was committed to the District Court of New South Wales for sentence.  
      
       
     4 The respondent first appeared for sentence on 4 September 2000 before Woods DCJ, when his Honour was informed that the respondent was five and a half months pregnant. Over objection by the Crown, his Honour adjourned the proceedings to 2 March 2001, and the respondent was released on bail.  
      
       
     5 On 7 January 2001, the respondent gave birth to her daughter Summer.  
      
       
     6 On 2 March 2001, the matter was back before Woods DCJ: and it was then adjourned to 20 March 2001 so that evidence could be given as to whether, in the event of imprisonment, continuity of contact between the respondent and her daughter could be maintained.  
      
       
     7 On 30 March 2001, evidence was given to the effect that, whilst there was a facility within the prison system in which the respondent could care for her daughter if sentenced to full-time imprisonment, acceptance into that facility was dependent on an assessment which would take a number of weeks, during which the respondent would be separated from her daughter. There was evidence from a psychologist that such separation would be absolutely traumatic for the baby.  
      
       
     8 Woods DCJ then sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for three years, and directed that she be released forthwith upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years.  
      
       
     9 The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal against the inadequacy of that sentence, and that appeal was heard on 10 August 2001. In its judgment delivered on 14 December 2001, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the District Court for imposition of an appropriate sentence: R v. Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522.  
      
       
     10 On 28 March 2002, the matter came before Solomon DCJ. There was evidence to the effect that, although some of the assessments for admission to the Mothers’ and Children’s Programme could be carried out prior to a person going into custody, there would still be at least a four-week delay from then until the question of admission could be determined, during which the mother and child would be separated.  
      
       
     11 Solomon DCJ adjourned the matter to 10 May 2002, when evidence was given by a psychiatrist to the effect that any separation for more than one week of the respondent from her child would be very traumatic to the child and very likely to have long-term and significant deleterious effects on the psychological makeup of the child. On 27 May 2002, Solomon DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for five years, and ordered that she be released forthwith upon entering into a recognisance, self in the sum of $5,000.00, to be of good behaviour for a period of five years.  
      
       
     12 The Crown appeals to this Court against the inadequacy of that sentence. 
      
       
        
       EARLIER COURT OF APPEAL JUDGMENT 
       
     13 In the Court of Appeal judgment determining the first appeal in this case, Spigelman CJ agreed with Grove J that the sentence imposed by Woods DCJ was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances. He said that the District Court should have deferred sentencing until the respondent had been assessed for entry into the relevant programme, so that the Court knew whether or not separation of the mother from the child would occur. His Honour pointed out that s.16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwth) authorised consideration of “the probable effect” of the sentence on the offender’s family, and not consideration of what was merely a possible effect; and also that the authorities indicated that such consideration could be given effect to only if exceptional hardship was shown.  
      
       
     14 Grove J stated that Woods DCJ erred in not adjourning the matter, so that the sentence could be decided on the basis of firm evidence of what conditions would pertain in relation to this respondent and her child in the event that an order committing her to prison was made. Grove J considered that the sentence of three years was so far below the lower extreme of the Court’s discretionary sentence as to manifest error, an error compounded by suspension of the entire sentence. His Honour did not indicate what he considered would have been an appropriate sentence, apart from considerations of hardship to the child, although he did set out a number of cases tending to suggest an appropriate sentence in the order of about six years.  
      
       
     15 Grove J also dealt with a submission by the respondent’s Counsel to the effect that periodic detention and home detention were available options, even in respect of a sentence exceeding three years, because of the provisions of s.20AB(1A) of the Crimes Act 1914. Grove J rejected that submission, and Spigelman CJ concurred in that rejection. 
      
       
     16 Einfeld AJ agreed with the orders proposed by Grove J, although his reasons varied to some extent from those of the other judges. 
      
       
        
       DECISION OF SOLOMON DCJ 
       
     17 Having regard to the nature of the Crown’s submissions, it is appropriate to set out at length the substantive reasons given by the sentencing judge for his decision: 
      
       
        
         
         I have had the benefit of closely reading the Court of Criminal Appeal decision and also the analysis by Justice Grove of the schedule of cases which was supplied to the Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time of the appeal. In arriving at the sentence for this prisoner I have considered each of the cases contained in the schedule. 
          
          
         In sentencing the prisoner I have considered each of the matters contained in s 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. I will now deal with a number of those matters. 
          
          
         The prisoner was born on 28 December 1977 and at the time of the commission of the offence did not have any criminal record. I am satisfied the prisoner's involvement in the importation of the prohibited drug was that of a courier. 
          
          
         I have considered the material contained in the three reports of a forensic psychiatrist Dr Roberts. Those reports indicate that the prisoner has had a disturbed background. Her biological father and mother were divorced when the prisoner was four years of age. I am satisfied the prisoner was the subject of abuse by her father. I am satisfied that, as an adult, the prisoner has suffered from depression and that three months prior to the commission of this offence the prisoner attempted to commit suicide. 
          
          
         I am satisfied the prisoner pleaded guilty to the offence at the earliest opportunity. The prisoner is entitled to a discount for the early plea. The early plea also indicates contrition on the part of the prisoner. 
          
          
         The prisoner has attempted to assist police. In this regard I refer to the letter of Federal Agent Smith of 21 July 2000, which is to be sealed with the registry papers. The sealed envelope is not to be opened except by leave of a Judge of this Court or by a Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The prisoner is entitled to a discount on her sentence in regard to the assistance given by her to police, even though the assistance was of little value. 
          
          
         I further take into consideration that this is the third occasion on which the prisoner has been dealt with in relation to this offence. The prisoner therefore faces triple jeopardy. There is material before me which indicates that the uncertainty as to the prisoner's future has caused her physical and psychological harm. In this regard I refer to the evidence of the prisoner's mother Annette Mochan in which she indicated that from the time the prisoner was advised of the intention of the Crown to appeal, the prisoner has suffered from significant weight loss and that she now appears physically to be similar to persons who are inmates of German camps in World War II. Further, Ms Mochan gave evidence that the prisoner, from the time she was advised of the Crown's intention to appeal, became very depressed and indicated at times that she did not wish to live. The anxiety of the prisoner has been aggravated by the delay in the sentencing process. 
          
          
         The prisoner has indicated positive signs of rehabilitation from the time of her arrest. In this regard I refer to the report of Dr Roberts of 22 March 2002 (exhibit O) in which Dr Roberts indicated that since her arrest in 1999 the prisoner has given birth to a child, the prisoner has cared for the child and the prisoner has established a natural foods supplement business with her partner Wayan Subakti. Further, the prisoner has proceeded to a partial completion of a degree in biotechnology at the University of Western Sydney. Further, the prisoner has adhered to all reporting conditions imposed upon her by the Courts involved in her sentence and has adhered to all probation and parole requirements.  
          
          
         Dr Roberts on p 6 of the report of 22 March 2002 (exhibitO) opined: 
          
           
           ""Ms Togias regrets her behaviour in this regard and having regards to the effects upon her of the legal processes including incarceration and her fears of incarceration as set out in my previous reports as well as the fact that she's matured and has achieved a stability in lifestyle, the probability of her reoffending is most remote."" 
           
          
          
         I agree with the doctor's opinion and am of the view that it is unlikely that the prisoner will reoffend. Insofar as the prisoner's rehabilitation is concerned, I further refer to the Probation and Parole report of Margaret Murdoch of 18 March 2002 in which Ms Murdoch opined: 
          
           
           ""Following her appearance in the Sydney District Court on 2 March 2001 the prisoner has complied with the conditions of the order issued by the Sydney District Court on 30 March 2001. She was referred to the Women's Positive Programme (WPP) which was presented by the Probation and Parole Service. Records show she has attended the programme between 23 July 2001 and 19 November 2001 and her participation was assessed as satisfactory.” 
           
          
          
         Ms Murdoch further opined: 
          
           
            “The offender is unlikely to benefit from supervision by this Service as there does not appear to be any further underlying issues that can be addressed by extended supervision or programmes administered by this Service."" 
           
          
          
         I now turn to s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act which provides that I must take into consideration and into account the probable effect of any sentence order under consideration by me would have on any of the prisoner's family or dependants. The prisoner and Mr Subakti’s child Summer is now sixteen months of age and is cared for by the prisoner who resides with her mother. There is evidence from a general practitioner, Dr Hannif (exhibit L) and from a psychiatrist, Dr Marilyn Moore (exhibit K) that the prisoner is breastfeeding Summer. Dr Moore has practised as a child psychiatrist from 1987 and was requested by the prisoner's solicitors to assess the degree of attachment between the prisoner and Summer. Dr Moore's opinion was also sought as to the effect on Summer in the event of there being separation between the prisoner and Summer for a period not less than one month. The prisoner, her mother Mrs Mochan and Summer attended upon Dr Moore's rooms on 17 April 2002. Dr Moore gave evidence in this case in which she indicated the procedures used by her in arriving at her opinions in relation to the degree of attachment between the prisoner and Summer and the effect of a separation of Summer and the prisoner. Dr Moore's report sets out important material which includes the following: Summer has been breastfed from birth and is now breastfed three or four times per day particularly at night. Summer has not been left with any other person including the prisoner's mother for more than a couple of hours from the time of her birth. Summer's father suffers from a condition known as sleep apnoea which causes him to spontaneously fall asleep during the day. The prisoner does not leave with Summer's father as she fears for Summer's safety if she was left in his care. The prisoner and Summer were found to interact extremely warmly. Dr Moore's testing revealed that when Summer was separated from her mother that Summer cried immediately and that she was able to be comforted by her grandmother, whereas when Summer was separated from her grandmother and not from her mother, Summer showed no signs of distress. 
          
          
         Dr Moore opined on p 6 of her report (exhibit K) as follows: 
          
           
           ""In summary, Summer presents as a securely attached child who is developing normally. Her mother's behaviour is sensitive, not intrusive or controlling and is likely to facilitate Summer's cognitive and emotional development. 
            
            
           A disruption in this bond is likely to lead to a regression in Summer's development and to a form of grief in the face of the loss of her most significant attachment figure it is likely to manifest as a form of childhood depression. Because of Summer's cognitive immaturity, she would not be able to understand the reason for her mother's apparent abandonment of her and is likely to be grief stricken. This is likely to have a significant impact on her emotional development and may render her vulnerable to the development of depression and possibly to personality dysfunction in later life. It may alter her secure attachment to an insecure attachment which has an inherent risk of psychopathology childhood and in later life. 
            
            
           Clearly, it is not in the best interests of Summer for her to be separated from her mother. Separation of a week for a young child is likely to be very traumatic. Summer does not have the cognitive maturity to understand the concepts of time or why her mother is absent. 
            
            
           If she is separated from her mother and can only visit her in gaol she is likely to be distressed and protest when she's reintroduced to her mother."" 
           
          
          
         In her evidence before the Court Dr Moore opined that in the event of there being separation of Summer from the prisoner for a period of more than one week it is probable that Summer would suffer psychological harm. The prisoner's mother Annette Mochan gave evidence that insofar as her looking after Summer was concerned that she could not, on a full time basis, care for Summer due to the fact that she was employed by Interlink Roads Pty Limited, a company which has the control of the M5 Motorway in Sydney. Mrs Mochan indicated she works four shifts per week and that she was on call twenty-four hours a day. Mrs Mochan indicated she works approximately thirty hours per week. Mrs Mochan indicated that if she was required to have the full time care of Summer that she may have the assistance of her sister. However, sister's assistance would only be forthcoming if her sister, who was in employment, was not working. Mrs Mochan gave evidence that she had observed Summer's father and was of the opinion that having regard to his condition of sleep apnoea that Summer could not safely be left in his care. Insofar as Summer's father's sleep apnoea is concerned there is material before me from the Sleep and Chest Disorder Centre to the effect that the prisoner's partner Mr Subakti undertook a sleep study on 27 March 2002. 
          
          
         I now turn to the facilities which are available in the New South Wales prison system for the incarceration of mothers and young children. I have heard evidence from Madeleine Loy, the co-ordinator of the Mother's and Children's Programme at the Emu Plains Correctional Centre and from Nicholas Kailis, an employee of the Department of Corrective Services, who has had extensive knowledge as to the classification of female prisoners. The effect of the evidence of Ms Loy and Mr Kailis is that it is not possible for the prisoner to be assessed as suitable to be accepted in the Mother and Children's Programme at Mulawa prior to the prisoner being incarcerated. I comment that I find such a position to be most undesirable. 
          
          
         A number of procedures have to be completed prior to an inmate being accepted into a Mother's and Children's Programme with her child. The procedure takes a minimum of four to six weeks. 
          
          
         The prisoner's mother has indicated her willingness to care for Summer during the initial period of her daughter's incarceration should she be incarcerated while she is being assessed as being suitable for Mother's and Children's Programme. However, I am concerned whether Mrs Mochan will be given the care of Summer during that period of time she would not be able to care for the child on a full time basis due to work commitments. Summer's father would also not be able to care for the child over the period of time due to his sleep apnoea condition. As I indicated earlier, Dr Moore in her evidence was of the opinion that it was probable that even after one week's separation between the prisoner and her daughter Summer, that Summer would probably suffer from psychological damage. 
          
          
         There is a facility available at Mulawa in which a child can visit its mother on a daily basis. However, Dr Moore was of the opinion this facility should not be utilised in the interests of Summer, as Summer would suffer trauma from daily separation from her mother. 
          
          
         I have formed a view that a full time custodial sentence would have the probable effect of causing Summer future psychological damage. I find exceptional circumstances and will not sentence the prisoner to a full time custodial sentence. 
          
          
         I now turn to the sentence. I am aware that this State does not have remissions and that the sentence imposed by me will not be reduced by remissions. I have formed the view that in this case no sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment in some form is appropriate. 
         
        
        
        
       SUBMISSIONS ON APPEAL 
       
     18 Mr. Bugg QC submitted that the sentencing judge’s decision showed an error of principle which this Court should correct, namely that he treated a finding of “exceptional circumstances” as justifying a non-custodial sentence, without weighing this against the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence. Mr. Bugg also submitted that there were errors in giving undue weight to subjective factors, in finding that were exceptional circumstances or exceptional hardship to the child, and in misinterpreting and not having proper regard to the previous judgment of the Court of Appeal.  
      
       
     19 Mr. Bugg submitted that considered objectively the offence called for a full-time custodial sentence. The offence was of the utmost seriousness, reflected in the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The quantity of drug imported was nearly double the commercial quantity. The case was one in which the need for general deterrence carried great weight. The earlier cases referred to by the Court of Appeal in its earlier judgment showed a range of head sentences for this type of offence of five to nine years, with non-parole periods of three to six years. The judgments of the Court of Appeal indicated that a custodial sentence was required in this case.  
      
       
     20 Mr. Bugg submitted that the effect of a sentence on the offender’s family could be taken into account only in exceptional circumstances or cases of exceptional hardship: R v. Edwards (1996) 90 ACrimR 510, R v. Carmody (1998) 100 ACrimR 41. There was nothing unusual in sending to prison offenders who had the care and support of young children, even very young children: R v. Niga NSWCCA 13/4/94, R v. Lux NSWCCA 26/8/88, R v. Capper [2000] NSWCCA 63. Full-time custodial sentences were imposed on pregnant women in R v. SLR (2000) 116 ACrimR 150 and R v. White [1999] NSWCCA 60. 
      
       
     21 Mr. Bugg submitted that the evidence before the sentencing judge was that the respondent’s mother could care for the child in the four to six week assessment period, and Dr. Moore said she would not have any concerns with the child being looked after by the respondent’s mother for this period. Neither the respondent nor the child’s father gave evidence, and the sentencing judge’s finding that the latter suffered from sleep apnoea and so could not look after the child was not supported by evidence. Also, the respondent conceived the child when these proceedings were on foot and the risk of a custodial sentence must have been apparent to her.  
      
       
     22 Mr. Bugg submitted that although this was a case where the proper sentence would have been about five to six years full-time custody, having regard to double jeopardy and the cumulative effect of the several sentencing hearings in this case, the appropriate sentence now would be three years’ periodic detention. Mr. Bugg submitted that s.20AB(1A) of the Crimes Act (Cwth) meant that the Court did not have to find first that three years was an appropriate sentence: it could consider all sentencing options, and if it considered three years’ periodic detention the best option, it could directly impose that sentence.  
      
       
        
       DECISION 
       
     23 Mr. Odgers SC for the respondent concurred in the last submission of Mr. Bugg, and I accept that submission. The Court of Appeal in its previous judgment held that s.20AB(1A) did not mean that periodic detention could be imposed for a sentence longer than three years; but it did not hold that the provision was not effective to take away the necessity of first fixing an appropriate term of imprisonment before considering whether it should be served by way of periodic detention. Thus I accept that, in the case of Commonwealth offences, the Court can consider directly whether a three year sentence of periodic detention is the preferable option. 
      
       
     24 As noted by Spigelman CJ in the previous Court of Appeal decision, s.16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act refers to the “probable” effect of a sentence on family members, not to possible effects. It is plain that a full-time custodial sentence would mean at least a four to six week separation of the respondent and her child, whilst she was being assessed for suitability for inclusion in the relevant programme. Dr. Moore did give the answer referred to by Mr. Bugg in his submissions, to the effect that she would not have any concern with the child being looked after by the respondent’s mother for this period. However, in the context of the whole of her evidence, this does not mean there would be no significant ill-effects from such separation, but rather that the respondent’s mother would be an appropriate carer if there had to be such separation. In re-examination, Dr. Moore assented to the proposition that “there is still the probability that there will be significant psychological damage if the separation is more than one week”.  
      
       
     25 More significantly, evidence from prison authorities as to the process for assessing the respondent for inclusion in the relevant programme did no more than set out in general terms what were the criteria that would be applied. Despite the previous judgment of the Court of Appeal, which contemplated that sentencing should be carried out with reliable information as to whether the respondent would be admitted to such a programme, there had not even been any preliminary assessment of the respondent’s suitability by the prison authorities.  
      
       
     26 Ms. Loy, the co-ordinator of the Mothers’ and Children’s Programme, gave evidence that for admission to the programme a woman had to be of the appropriate security classification, drug-free, stable, not violent, and so on. These are of course appropriate concerns. There are no doubt substantial administrative reasons why it was not possible to carry out even a preliminary assessment of the respondent between 14 December 2001 and 28 March 2002, and why it is not possible to make even a provisional determination of suitability prior to the commencement of full-time custody. However, the result of all this is that the Court has no reliable material on which to base a judgment as to whether the respondent would be admitted to the programme. The respondent is totally unable to assist the Court further on that matter. While as I have said there are no doubt substantial administrative grounds why this is so, the fact remains that the authorities responsible for prosecution and punishment, who could possibly assist the Court further, have not done so.  
      
       
     27 In those circumstances, there is in my opinion material upon which an inference can be drawn that there is a probability, not necessarily a greater than fifty percent probability, but nevertheless a substantial probability, that the respondent will be separated from her child for the whole of her sentence; and in circumstances where the respondent is helpless to take the matter further but the prosecuting and punishing authorities could possibly do so, fairness between the parties makes it reasonable to draw that inference. That is, the Court should proceed from the basis that there is a probability and not merely a possibility that the child will be subjected to separation from her mother for the whole of any full-time custodial sentence. I do not overlook that this is a Commonwealth prosecution, and that the matter of punishment is in the hands of New South Wales State authorities. I do not think this significantly affects the considerations I have given: the Commonwealth has chosen to leave the execution of punishment to the State authorities.  
      
       
     28 There is evidence that such separation from the mother and primary carer of a child of this age is likely to cause long-term and significant deleterious effects on the psychological makeup of the child. The case is different from those of SLR and White, because it was assumed that in these cases the child could remain with the mother in custody. In all the circumstances, in my opinion there was no error in the sentencing judge finding exceptional circumstances, or exceptional hardship to the child. I should add that this view is not based on the lack of availability of another carer, such as the respondent’s mother or her partner; but rather is based on the evidence about the severe effects of separation from the mother and primary carer. 
      
       
     29 Apart from hardship to the child, there were other significant subjective factors referred to by the sentencing judge; but in my opinion, even giving full weight to those factors, the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence, coupled with the consideration of the matter in the previous Court of Appeal judgment, indicate that, apart from the question of hardship to the child, a sentence of less than about five years with a non-parole period of about three years would have been inadequate. 
      
       
     30 Mr Bugg submitted that the sentencing judge was in error in not weighing the objective seriousness of the offence against the hardship to the child. In my opinion, on a fair reading of the judgment as a whole, it should not be inferred that the sentencing judge did not have regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and did not weigh it against the considerations relating to hardship to the child.  
      
       
     31 The question then is whether, in a case otherwise requiring something like a five year sentence with a three year non-parole period, hardship to the child justified suspending the whole sentence. But for considerations of double jeopardy, I believe I would have taken the view that anything less than three years’ periodic detention would have been outside the range of reasonable exercise of discretion. However, this is the second Crown appeal and the fourth sentencing hearing which the respondent has faced, and in all the circumstances, I do not think interference by this Court with the sentence imposed below is now justified. 
      
       
     32 For those reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     33 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     34 SMART AJ: The facts, circumstances and submissions of the parties are set out in the reasons of Hodgson JA. I will supplement that account. 
      
       
     35 On 7 October 1999 Ms Togias arrived at Sydney International Airport on board a flight from Indonesia. She was travelling alone. After a baggage search Customs officers performed a frisk search of Ms Togias and located a bulky item underneath her clothing around her waist. On her incoming passenger card Ms Togias had answered ""No"" to the question, ""Are you bringing into Australia goods that maybe prohibited or subject to restrictions, such as medicines, steroids, firearms, weapons of any kind or illicit drugs?"" When questioned by Customs officers about the nature of the bulky item around her waist Ms Togias stated, ""No I don't know. You know that German guy, you know that he raped me, he put this on."" That story was an invention. 
      
       
     36 Five sealed clear plastic body packs containing small circular off white tablets were taken from her body. There were about 8282 MDMA (or ecstasy) tablets, weighing about 2,1645 grams gross. Their approximate street value was $400,000. The calculated pure MDMA was 967.5 grams. This is nearly twice the commercial quantity. The offence was thus a serious one. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment. She was in custody for a week before being granted bail.  
      
       
     37 On 22 March 2000, having pleaded guilty, she was committed for sentence by the Local Court to the District Court. A Pre-Sentence Report was prepared on 12 July 2000 for a Court hearing on 24 July 2000. Nothing was said in this report about her having become pregnant or the relationship which she had formed. 
      
       
     38 On 31 August 2000 a further Pre-Sentence Report was prepared for a Court hearing on 4 September 2000. It noted that she had been in a stable relationship for the past 18 months (that is, from well before the commission of the offence) and that she had stated that she was about six months pregnant. On 4 September 2000 the sentence hearing was adjourned to 2 March 2001, against the Crown's opposition, by Woods DCJ to enable Ms Togias to have the baby in the meantime. The baby was born on 7 January 2001. 
      
       
     39 The objective seriousness of the offence demanded a full time custodial sentence of five to six years with a non-parole period of three to four years. A suspended sentence could not be contemplated for an offence of this gravity. The question is whether a suspended sentence was permissible because of the baby. There is the further question of the delay which has occurred. 
      
       
     40 One matter which was investigated at the further sentencing hearing before Solomon DCJ in March-May 2002 was whether, if Ms Togias was sent to gaol, she could take her child with her. As at May 2002 the child was 16 months old. In about late 1996 the NSW State Government established the Jacaranda Cottages at Emu Plains Gaol. Those cottages are for prisoners with low security ratings, that is, a C rating. The cottages allow mothers sentenced to prison to have very young children, that is, under 5 years of age, with them. There are 20 places available but no more than about 13 places are usually occupied.  
      
       
     41 To ensure that the Scheme continues to be successful and that the applicant mother will fit in at the cottages and with the mothers there, the Department engages upon an extensive process of assessment. This includes observation of her in a custodial setting. Thus the assessments are made after the mother has entered into custody. The reasons for that are explained in the evidence. The process of assessment and running a custodial unit for mothers with young children are not as simple or straightforward as may appear at first sight. It takes not less than about four weeks after the mother is put in prison before a decision is made whether to place the mother in the Jacaranda Cottages. It may take considerably longer. Meanwhile the mother and the baby are separated. The officers of Corrective Services were unable to say whether Ms Togias would be accepted into the Cottages. There appeared to be no way of avoiding the separation of Ms Togias and her baby for four weeks or a much longer period if she were sent to prison. There were indications that Ms Togias was likely to meet the selection criteria but this was far from certain.  
      
       
     42 It is not possible to say one way or the other whether Ms Togias would have been ultimately admitted to the Jacaranda Cottages but what was clear was that the mother and the baby would be separated for a substantial period and this would probably prove harmful to the child. She was still being breast fed at the time of the hearing before the judge in May 2002, It was Ms Togias' plan to continue to breast feed her daughter until she was about two years of age. 
      
       
     43 The judge was confronted with a very difficult situation and one which was probably not envisaged by this Court in its earlier decision. On the one hand the serious offence warranted a substantial custodial sentence. On the other hand the expert medical evidence was that the separation of Ms Togias from her child for more than a week was likely to cause significant long term psychological damage to the child. There was no evidence to the contrary. 
      
       
     44 Faced with that evidence the judge could hardly impose a sentence of full time custody on the applicant. It is true that Ms Togias fell pregnant about March/April 2000, some six months after the offence was committed. However, this case turns on the likelihood of significant damage to a child which could have long term consequences for her and the community. 
      
       
     45 The Crown was concerned about the creation of a special class of offender who, although she had committed a serious offence (and one for which the maximum penalty was life imprisonment) nevertheless would not be sent to gaol because of a very young baby. Was falling pregnant after committing an offence the way to avoid effective and timely punishment? Much the same question could be asked of a lady who gave birth to a baby shortly before or shortly after the commission of an offence. A suspended sentence of 5 years holds the sword over a person's head for 5 years to be of good behaviour. However, if the offender behaves she does not go to gaol at all. 
      
       
     46 In real and practical terms a sentence of periodic detention of 3 years exceeds the impact on the offender of a suspended sentence of 5 years. Section 20AB(1A) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) enables a Court when dealing with a Commonwealth offence to impose a sentence of periodic detention direct without having to first pass a sentence of imprisonment and then order that it be served by way of periodic detention. In this respect the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) differs from the NSW legislation. 
      
       
     47 The sentence imposed by the judge failed to reflect adequately the objective gravity of the offence. It was manifestly inadequate. In the face of the medical evidence it was open to the judge to take the view that a sentence of full time custody should not be imposed. However, it was erroneous not to impose a sentence of periodic detention of 3 years. No non-parole period should have been fixed. This is not adequate punishment for a serious offence but it was pre-eminently the only solution in this difficult case. Such a sentence goes some way to reflecting the gravity of the offence and avoids significant damage to the child. The appellant's mother and her de facto husband (and the father) could have looked after the child while her mother was serving her weekend detention. The evidence as to the de facto husband suffering disabling sleep apnoea was tenuous. 
      
       
     48 The question remains as to what should now be done. The troubled history of three proceedings has resulted in a delay of about 17 months since Woods DCJ sentenced Ms Togias. The delay prior to that was the result of Ms Togias' application not to be sentenced prior to the birth of her baby. As a result of the delay she has now had the advantage of being able to rear her baby from birth until now, a period of nearly 20 months. It is true that she has had the stress of these proceedings continuing but that is more than offset by the benefit of not going to prison so far and not being separated from her baby.  
      
       
     49 The appellant has suffered jeopardy on four occasions. In addition to the welfare of the baby she has strong subjective features. Nevertheless the gravity of the offence remains as does the need to impose a sentence reflecting that gravity at least in part. Ms Togias should be sentenced to 3 years periodic detention. No non-parole period should be fixed as this is the least sentence that should be imposed. I have proceeded on the basis that Ms Togias would not be able to take her baby with her while she serves her periodic detention on weekends and that her mother and husband would care for the child on those weekends. 
      
       
     50 This case has revealed serious problems in the sentencing of mothers with babies. The medical evidence given in this case could probably be repeated in almost every case where a mother has a baby shortly before or after the commission of an offence and prior to sentencing. The Commonwealth Crown is concerned about drug dealers recruiting women of prior good character, as here, to act as couriers and then being met with the situation which has arisen in the present case. Both Federal and State authorities should anticipate that in the future expert medical evidence will be led to the same effect as in this case with possibly the same result. They may wish to consider whether in the interests of the administration of justice steps should be taken whereby the Court can be assured that a mother will be able to take her baby with her from the date of her sentence or first incarceration except, of course, where that would pose dangers to the mother or the child. 
      
       
     51 I propose that Ms Togias be sentenced to periodic detention for 3 years from a date to be fixed by this Court and that no non-parole period be fixed.

    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender has pleaded guilty to a charge of detaining for advantage (s 90A of the Crimes Act, since repealed) and concealing a serious offence (s 316(1) of the Act). He was sixteen years old at the relevant time and, in accordance with s 11(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, I shall not name him. Almost everyone else involved in this affair, including the victim, was also a juvenile at the time and is entitled to the anonymity afforded by that provision. It is convenient to refer to all of them by their initials. 
     
      
    2 The first charge relates to the offender’s limited participation in events which culminated in the murder of a young man, HHL, in the southwest of Sydney on 7 August 1996. The second charge arises from the offender’s failure to say anything to the police about the murder until he was interviewed about it on 19 December 1996. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 In the afternoon of 7 August 1996 the deceased, HHL, was escorted from a coffee shop at Bankstown by a number of young men, including three to whom I shall refer as MHN, TNT and HLD. He was taken to a station wagon and driven to a nearby park, where he was seriously assaulted. He was then driven to a house at Villawood. The offender and another man, PP, lived at that house and they were there at the time. 
     
      
    4 The deceased was placed into a bedroom and PP directed the offender to guard him. The deceased was obviously injured as a result of the assault perpetrated upon him at the park. The offender kept watch on him for several hours, and during that period he heard MHN say that he was to be killed. From what he said, it appeared that MHN feared reprisals from associates of the deceased if he were allowed to go. What MHN or any of the other men had against the deceased is entirely obscure and it is not suggested that the offender knew anything about that. 
     
      
    5 The deceased was later taken from the bedroom to the garage of the premises, where one or more of the other men attempted to strangle him with a length of wire. At this time the offender went to the garage but, as soon as he saw what was being done, he ran back to the house. HLD returned to the house and told the offender what had happened, saying that the deceased was unconscious but not dead. The other men then drove the deceased to a construction site at Chester Hill. Either there or at some other location MHN stabbed him a number of times in the throat. Early the following morning his dead body was found at that site.  
     
      
    6 MHN was arrested and charged with the murder in November 1996. He later pleaded guilty to that offence and was sentenced by Kirby J. More recently, TNT and HLD were also arrested and charged. TNT pleaded guilty to the murder before me and has been sentenced. For his part in the incident, HLD pleaded guilty before me to attempted murder and is yet to be sentenced. 
     
      
    7 As I have said, the offender was interviewed on 19 November 1996. At that stage he said nothing about his own involvement, but claimed that MHN had told him after the incident what had occurred. However, in a subsequent interview on 21 March 2001, he made admissions consistent with the facts which I have outlined. He told police that, when the deceased was brought to the house, he thought that the other men would release him in due course and it was not until “a couple of hours later” that he became aware that he was to be killed. When he heard MHN say that, he said, he was scared. Asked in evidence before me why he did not try to stop the killing, he said that there was nothing he could do as he was the youngest of the group. He also expressed remorse, which I accept as genuine, for the plight of the deceased and for his own part in the incident. 
     
      
    8 He was arrested on 24 April 2001 and has been in custody since.  
     
      
       
      Assistance to Authorities 
       
      
    9 Significantly, at around the same time as his confession of March 2001, the offender also provided police with information about another unrelated murder which he had witnessed. He gave evidence for the prosecution in relation to that matter, both at committal and at trial, and convictions were obtained. I gather that that evidence was important and he was described by the Crown prosecutor in those proceedings as an excellent witness. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    10 The offender is now twenty two years old. He was born in Vietnam and has two sisters, one older than he and one younger. When he was about three years old his parents left Vietnam, taking the younger sister with them. They made their way to Malaysia and, after some years in refugee camps in that country, arrived in Australia. The offender and his older sister remained in Vietnam with their grandmother. They joined their parents in Australia in 1990, when he was about ten.  
     
      
    11 The family lived at Canley Vale. In evidence, the offender described his father as a devout Buddhist and a very strict man. His parents worked very long hours at a clothing factory on six, sometimes seven, days of the week and they later went into business on their own account. Their industriousness was laudable and, no doubt, was motivated by their desire to provide for their children. Unfortunately, however, they had little free time to devote to the offender. He was unhappy and was not attending school regularly, and at the age of sixteen he ran away from home. It was in these circumstances that he formed his association with the other young men involved in this tragic incident, and came to be living at the house at Villawood. 
     
      
    12 For some years thereafter he appears to have lost direction in his life and to have drifted within a criminal subculture. He began to abuse a variety of illicit drugs. His criminal history includes entries in New South Wales for possessing and supplying heroin, and in Queensland for possessing cannabis. In evidence, he acknowledged having been a street dealer in those drugs. That said, his record is relatively minor and is consistent with his wayward lifestyle. I consider it of little significance for present purposes. 
     
      
    13 Much has changed since the offender was taken into custody in April last year. He has re-established contact with his family. His parents separated in the late 1990’s. They now live apart in Queensland but, apparently, they stay in touch and are supportive of each other. They have maintained contact with the offender through regular visits and telephone calls. He also enjoys contact with his siblings, who live in Sydney, and other members of his extended family. His parents and other family members were present at the sentence hearing. 
     
      
    14 He has been detained at the Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre. He has pursued his education and last year attained the School Certificate. He has also undertaken a number of practical training courses, including cabinet making. He hopes, with the assistance of his teacher at Kariong, to obtain an apprenticeship in that trade upon his release. Finally, he has been undergoing counselling to address his substance abuse and other lifestyle issues. 
     
      
    15 A chaplain at Kariong gave evidence and provided a brief report, which speaks favourably of the offender’s behaviour whilst at the centre, his insight into his previous debased lifestyle and his determination to seize the opportunities for improvement available to him while in custody. I also have the benefit of a helpful background report from the Department of Juvenile Justice. Its assessment of the offender is encouraging and is consistent with my own conclusions from the whole of the evidence. This is a young man who has had a difficult background and whose life became completely derailed during a significant period of his adolescence and early adulthood. The maturity he has achieved whilst in custody is demonstrated not only by his participation in education, training and counselling, but also by his remorse, his insight into his crimes and his willingness to assist the authorities in the prosecution of the other murder to which I have referred. My sentencing order must be fashioned so as to foster his prospects of rehabilitation, which are good. 
     
      
    16 Where he will live upon his release is a matter of some concern. To pursue the apprenticeship in cabinet making it may be necessary for him to live in Western Sydney but, given his assistance to the authorities, he may be in some danger there. He may be able to live in Queensland with one or other of his parents, but his employment prospects there are unknown. This, however, is not a matter which I can resolve. No doubt, those supervising him will give it careful attention. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    17 For the offence of detaining for advantage, s 90A provided for a maximum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment unless the Court was satisfied that the victim had been liberated without substantial injury, in which event the maximum was 14 years. The present offence, of course, carries the higher maximum. (Provision for the offence is now to be found in s 86 of the Crimes Act). I have been supplied with Judicial Commission statistics for sentence under s 90A, derived from a sample of one hundred and twenty seven cases. Of those, eighty six resulted in full time custodial sentences. The sentences ranged from 6 months to 10 years, with a significant number being of the order of 3 to 4 years. No doubt, some of the recorded cases, including some of those which were visited with custodial sentences, involved offences carrying the lesser maximum. 
     
      
    18 For concealing a serious offence, s 316(1) of the Crimes Act provides a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment. Understandably, I was not furnished with sentencing statistics for that offence. Its ambit is so wide that any figures would be of little or no assistance. However, I was supplied with one decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal where the offence concealed was murder: R v Crofts (CCA, unreported, 10.3.95). That case involved an adult offender who was able to make out a strong subjective case. The Court confirmed a sentence of 6 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    19 In the present case, the offence of detaining for advantage is a serious one. The offender kept guard on the victim for some hours knowing, for at least part of that time, that he was to be killed. The offence under s 316, though clearly related to the more serious offence, extended over a period of several months, and I am persuaded by the Crown prosecutor’s argument that it calls for a cumulative sentence. 
     
      
    20 On the other hand, the offender has made out a substantial claim for leniency. Apart from the subjective matters to which I have referred, appropriate weight must be given to his youth at the relevant time, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences: R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at paras 22-5. The sentences otherwise appropriate for both offences must be reduced in recognition of his admissions to the police, belated as they were, his pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. Clearly, there are special circumstances calling for a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period.  
     
      
    21 But for the offender’s plea of guilty and cooperation with the authorities, I would have imposed a sentence of 5 years imprisonment for the offence of detaining for advantage. In the light of those factors, I propose to reduce that sentence by forty percent to 3 years. I shall specify a non-parole period of 12 months. His concealing a serious offence calls for an undiscounted sentence of 6 months imprisonment, and I consider that justice would be achieved by a one-third reduction to 4 months. 
     
      
    22 On the charge of detaining for advantage, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years, to date from 24 April 2001, with a non-parole period of 12 months. On the charge of concealing a serious offence, he is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 months, to commence at the expiration of that non-parole period. Upon the expiry of that sentence he will be entitled to release on parole, and I direct that he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for as much of the remainder of the 3 year sentence as that Service thinks fit. I shall consult the parties about any further order which should be made, given the provisions of ss 48 and 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      (After hearing submissions from counsel, his Honour added:) 
       
      
    23 In accordance with s 48 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I note that the earliest date on which the offender might be released is today and, in accordance with s 50 of that Act, I direct his release today.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (Trial by judge without a jury) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: From time to time cases such as this come before this court. They are immensely tragic, not only for the family and the loved ones of those who have been deprived of the society of their relatives but immensely tragic also for an accused who suffers from some such illness as deprives that person, in law, of the understanding we regard in a civilized society as necessary before a person becomes amenable to punishment for their conduct. 
     
      
    2 On a murder trial such as this, it is necessary to relive what happened in these appallingly tragic circumstances to the deceased and to relive the appalling conduct of the accused when he killed them. It is important to recognize that the court is not insensitive to the tragedy that has affected those that have been left and which has affected and will affect the accused for the rest of his life, as that tragedy will affect the members of the family and the loved ones of the deceased for the rest of theirs. 
     
      
    3 I commence these reasons with those words so that it will be understood that the recognition by both the prosecution and the defence that the accused did perform the acts causing the deaths and did have, at the time of the acts causing death, that mental condition and did perform those acts with that mental condition such as would otherwise make him liable for the offence of murder but for the fact also recognised, after proper investigation by the Crown, that although the accused had that mental condition and did those acts he was at the time suffering from mental illness. 
     
      
    4 This case, it appears to me, having seen the extent of the investigation of whether the accused was at the time affected by mental illness, has been conducted by those police investigating those medical practitioners and those involved as legal practitioners, with a considerable degree of skill and sensitivity. It has been presented to me in a way which enables my task to be performed, hopefully, in a way which shows the court's compassion for all concerned. 
     
      
    5 The accused stands charged with three counts of murder. I am required to try those matters without a jury being satisfied of the necessary formal matters required by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    6 On the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the acts causing the deaths charged, the accused had the intention to kill. I am satisfied, in accordance with the agreement that has been filed, that the accused caused the deaths charged in each count. The material relating to mental illness I shall refer to in a moment. 
     
      
    7 There has been provided to me in evidence a summary of facts. That summary of facts discloses that from the accused's middle teenage years he suffered from schizophrenia and had, from time to time, been treated for it and admitted to hospital because of it. I am satisfied that his parents were well aware of his suffering from the illness. Indeed, on 1 November 2001 his mother told his sister of actions by the accused which were plainly consistent with the symptomatology of the disease. On 2 November other actions were seen by members of the general community to have been perpetrated by the accused which plainly showed, with hindsight one can say, that the disease was affecting him and he was showing symptoms of it. On Saturday 3 November his threat to a child and his statement to Ms. Hill concerning his parents indicated clearly enough that he was suffering from a resumption of his mental illness. The message he left for his sister on the Monday was seen by her to be strange in nature and similarly, after the deaths the messages left for Mr. Newman and Mr. Carr concerning what he said had happened to the parents indicated adequately enough that he was not reasoning with rationality. 
     
      
    8 His subsequent actions indicated that he had some, but limited, insight into what he had done. What he had done was to kill his parents and his brother. At the police station where he referred to his being ""Inca"" from the Amazon or Colombia and in his other responses to the police, he showed a sufficiently bizarre pattern of behaviour as to enable even a lay identification of his being mentally ill. 
     
      
    9 Following his detention in custody, an extensive medical history came to light confirming that the accused had suffered from a treatment-resistant variant of schizophrenia for many years. Dr. Westmore, who examined the accused on behalf of the Crown, concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is evidence on the history he provides and supported by documents in the brief, that Mr. Shew was acutely mentally ill at the time his parents and brother died. He appears to have had command hallucinations directing him to kill his parents and it is possible that he had delusional beliefs regarding family members. 
        
       
       
        
        He suffers from the illness schizophrenia. This is a disease of the mind which would have totally deprived him of his knowledge and understanding that he should not commit the act. He qualifies, therefore, for the defence of mental illness to the charges of murder."" 
        
       
      
    10 That doctor went on to refer to the fact that some insight and understanding had later been gained by the accused into the nature of his illness, he having previously had poor or little insight into that illness and having failed, for that reason, to comply with treatment that had been offered to him. The medical reports and the other material in the brief seem to indicate that he was unable, because he was unwilling, to comply with such regimens of treatment as might have been available. He was unwilling, no doubt, because of the very mental illness it was sought to treat. 
     
      
    11 Dr. Allnutt concluded also that his capacity to think rationally about his behaviour and to contemplate its wrongfulness was so substantively impaired by delusions and auditory hallucinations that he felt irrationally justified to act in the manner that he did. Dr. Allnutt was of the view that, at the time of the acts causing death, the accused did understand the nature and quality of the acts but did not understand that the acts were wrong. 
     
      
    12 Having referred to various factors as operating upon the accused, he said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""All these factors would have had the compounding effect of impairing his ability to judge his thoughts and test their reality in relation to his situation or in relation to how others may act in similar circumstances. He believed, nihilistically, that he would be 'a zombie' and 'nothing' if he did not act that night. Under these circumstances he was compelled to act as the voice intended and his beliefs justified this. It is unlikely that he would have been able to rationally contemplate the wrongfulness of his actions with any degree of sense or composure."" 
        
       
      
    13 Dr. Nielssen concluded that the accused:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Has a severe and disabling mental illness characterised by perceptual disturbances in the form of auditory hallucinations, of voices, delusional beliefs arising from hallucinations, disorganized and illogical thinking and abnormal emotional responses."" 
        
       
      
    14 He concluded with an opinion as to the existence of those matters which constitute the defence of mental illness in law:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""I believe Mr. Shew has the defence of mental illness open to him, as he has a disease of the brain, chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia, that produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognized in law to be a disease of the mind. His mental illness produced a defect of reason, that his family was not his real family and that he should act on auditory hallucinations telling him to kill his family. The severe disorder of thought form and mood disturbance at the time of the offence deprived him of the understanding that his actions were wrong, and also deprived him of the ability to reason with composure about his actions, or to exercise self-control."" 
        
       
      
    15 It is my understanding of all of the opinions of all three of the psychiatrists, that although they express their conclusion in different language, each of them is of the view that at the time of the acts causing each of the three deaths, the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know either the nature and quality of the acts he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. And as to the last, such that he was unable to reason concerning the wrongfulness of his act with any real degree of sense or composure (see The Queen v. M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718 and The Queen v. Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182 and in particular at 188). 
     
      
    16 The evidence and the opinions of the doctors in respect of that evidence all speaks with one voice when analysed. That is, that the defence which is provided for by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 applies in this case. That section provides that if at the time of their actions a person was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law in the sense referred to in M'Naghten (supra) and Porter (supra), for his actions, then the special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, must be passed. 
     
      
    17 The effect of that verdict, by reason of s.39 of that Act, is that the court must order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit, until released by due process of law. It is necessary, when considering whether the special verdict should be returned, for me to bear in mind and indeed, to set out in these reasons, the matters which are the legal and practical consequences of the findings which are open in the trial. 
     
      
    18 If an order is made that the accused be detained in strict custody, the accused comes under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. That body comprises a legally qualified President or Deputy President and two other members, one of whom must be a psychiatrist and the other of whom must be a person of suitable qualifications and experience to so serve. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal commences a review of the accused's case. That review can take more than 14 days but at the conclusion of the review, a recommendation as to detention or release of the accused will be made to the Minister for Health. That recommendation could be for action to be taken that is unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. It is only if the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by the accused that it could make a recommendation to the effect that the accused be released. If it makes a recommendation, that could be considered by the Department of Health and then, if necessary, by the Governor. It is only if the Governor were advised that a release was appropriate that the accused might be released into the community. 
     
      
    19 The Mental Health Review Tribunal can determine and must at least once every six months for the remainder of the time that the accused person is detained, review his case. In each case it could make an appropriate recommendation to the Minister for Health for further detention, care and treatment or for possible release. Again, the accused would only be released if there was advice from the Department to the Governor to that effect, upon the basis that the tribunal had concluded there was no danger to himself or others. If he were released, it might be on conditions to ensure that there are appropriate measures taken to protect him from his illness and to protect others from the consequences of it. The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient detained in this fashion is when released in accordance with the procedure to which I have referred. 
     
      
    20 I have regard to those consequences and I have regard to the statement that the accused has made today, as well as the evidence which has been presented to me, by consent, as a common body of evidence and which has been presented in that fashion simply because the evidence is all to one point. 
     
      
    21 I conclude that I must legally find the special verdict that, at the time of the acts constituting the offence charged, the accused was suffering from mental illness so as not to be responsible for his actions and I so find that verdict. I therefore must order, pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 to which I have referred, that the accused be detained in a place of strict custody until released by due process of law. In this case the appropriate place would be Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
    22 I therefore find the accused, as to each of the charges in the indictment, not guilty by reason of mental illness. I order that he be detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital or such other place as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the processes of law, until released by due process of law.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, who was charged with the murder, on 19 August 1986, of Samantha Terese Knight, has pleaded guilty to her manslaughter. That plea has been accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment, and he now appears for sentence. 
     
      
      FACTS 
      
    2 The present offence needs to be understood in the context of the prisoner’s history of having committed serious sexual offences in relation to a large number of children over a period in excess of 15 years.  
     
      
    3 In early 1996, 2 young children each 7 years of age, complained that the prisoner had been indecently assaulting them and taking nude photographs of them. He was, that the time, employed as a gardener at Royal North Shore Hospital.  
     
      
    4 On 2 and 6 February 1996, searches were made of his work shed and of his residence. Some thousands of 35 mm slides, photographs and negatives, depicting children in indecent poses and in the course of being sexually assaulted were found. Also discovered were a number of pornographic books and articles, children’s underwear and cameras, as well as various texts in relation to child abuse, incest and child photography. 5 When interviewed by police on 6 February 1996, he admitted the offences concerning the two girls which had initiated the investigation, and acknowledged having a problem in his dealings with children, specifically involving an obsession with photographing them and also with collecting underwear. In subsequent interviews on 20 February 1996 and 4 April 1996, he identified, by name, some at least of the children shown in the various photographs and slides, but he did not admit, with one exception, to having behaved indecently in relation to them. 6 As a consequence police operation Jadite was commenced in order to investigate possible further offences on the part of the prisoner, in the course of which he was also interviewed in April and July 1996 concerning the disappearance of Samantha Knight. 7 During the April interview he acknowledged having met Samantha once or twice at Manly, but claimed to have no knowledge in relation to her disappearance. He also acknowledged having kept scrap books which included details of missing children such as Samantha and the Beaumont children, which he said he had thrown away, claiming that he had compiled these books out of his interest in mysteries, but for no other reason. 8 During the interviews on 9 and 10 July 1996 he accepted that he may have photographed Samantha at Manly, although “not in a sexual way”. He insisted that he had nothing to hide. In the course of a discursive and somewhat rambling interview, in which his interest, if not fascination, concerning the disappearance of children was mentioned more than once, he offered some extraordinary suggestions along the lines that the explanation possibly lay in kidnapping by aliens, or by white slave traders.9 In the course of the continuation of the interview on 10 July, he volunteered that he thought that Cooper Park would be the area to search for Samantha, saying that he had been there before her disappearance looking for Aboriginal sites. Once again he specifically denied having anything to do with Samantha’s disappearance and he returned to his theory that aliens or white slavers, or additionally, on this occasion, that Satanists, may have been involved. 10 When he appeared before his Honour Judge Flannery, in the District Court, on 12 September 1996, he pleaded guilty to some 60 counts involving sexual offences in relation to 9 young girls and 2 young boys extending over a period of approximately 15 years between January 1980 and January 1996. In summary, the counts which were before the Court involved the following offences: 
     
      
      (a) 18 counts of indecent assault pursuant to s 61M(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) 1 count of aggravated indecent assault pursuant to s 61M(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) 16 counts of administer stupefying drug (Normison) pursuant to s 38 of the Crimes Act. 
       
       
      (d) 15 counts of sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s 61D(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       comprising acts of penile penetration, penetration with a finger and with objects, and oral intercourse  
      
     
     
      
      (e) 1 count of aggravated act of indecency with a child under the age of 16 years pursuant to s 61O(2)  
      Crimes Act; 
      
     
     
      
      (f) 6 counts of indecency with a child under the age of 10 years pursuant to s 61O(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
      
     
     
      
      (g) 2 counts of indecency pursuant to s 61E(2) of the  
      Crimes Act; 
      
     
     
      
      (h) 1 count of common assault. 
      
     
     
      
      An offence of possession of child pornography was also taken into account on a Form 1. 
      
    11 The victims in these cases had, in most instances, come into contact with the prisoner after he had befriended their mothers. In the remaining cases the victims were friends of other victims. He had been a regular visitor to the homes of the women whom he had befriended, and he had provided gifts and outings for the children. As appears from the reasons for sentence, and from other materials placed before me, in a number of instances the children had been given the drug Normison mixed with Coca Cola, as a prelude to the commission of the sexual offences, and to the taking of photographs of them with their genitals exposed. 12 The offences, his Honour found, were objectively “very very serious”, involving as they did offences extending over 15 years, concerning children between the ages of 2 years and 16 years, the use of stupefying drugs in circumstances which were found to be dangerous, and the betrayal of trust particularly so far as the prisoner had befriended vulnerable families, as well as being offences which had been committed for his own sexual gratification. 13 When appearing before Judge Flannery, the prisoner proffered shame and disgust for what he had done, and claimed to be facing his criminality “head on”. He was unable to offer any excuse for what he had done and said that it was “something that I really didn’t have control over”.14 At that time, the prisoner was aged 45 years and had no prior convictions for sexual offences. His pleas were accepted as having been offered at the earliest possible time. He was also regarded as having had a good work background, and to have had a traumatic childhood.15 The sentences imposed were all backdated to 28 February 1996, being the date on which he had been taken into custody. For the 16 charges under s 38 of the Crimes Act, that is, the administration of a stupefying drug with intent thereby to commit an indictable offence, sentences were imposed of 16 years penal servitude which would have expired on 27 February 2012. Minimum terms of 10 years were fixed, which would have been due to expire on 27 February 2006. In relation to all of the other offences concurrent fixed terms were imposed comprising sentences of 6 years for the s 61D(1) offences, 4 years for the s 61M(2) offences, 12 months for the s 61M(1) offence, 18 months for the s 61O(1), 61O(2) and 61E(2) offences, and 9 months for the common assault offence. 16 In May 1998, a further investigation was conducted into the activities of the prisoner by Crime Agencies which established Strike Force Harrisville.17 In the course of that investigation members of the Task Force became aware that the prisoner also had property stored in a rented storage unit at Girraween. It was searched pursuant to warrant on 16 June 1998, and a substantial quantity of further photographs, and photo transparencies were located, again of a pornographic nature, depicting other young girls, some of whom appeared to be drugged, and who had their genitals exposed. Two further victims were identified through these photographs. Apart from the photographs police also recovered the three scrap books containing newspaper cuttings, concerning the disappearance of Samantha Knight, which the prisoner had previously said had been thrown away. 18 Inquiries showed that that the prisoner had come into contact with the two young victims, who were identified from the photographs, after first meeting the mother of one of them. Subsequently he had been introduced to her friend. He had been a frequent visitor to the home of the first victim, and had often acted as a babysitter for her. The further offences had been committed at the home of this girl, and they followed a similar modus operandi. Apart from the acts of indecent touching, and the taking of photographs of the victims while their genitals were exposed, there were a number of acts of oral intercourse and digital penetration performed by the prisoner.19 These offences were committed between January 1983 and May 1985, while the girls were aged between 5 and 8 years.20 Arising out of these inquiries the prisoner was reinterviewed by police on 19 July 1999, and made a number of admissions in relation to the further offences, and in relation to his practice of photographing girls for his sexual pleasure. Questions were again put to him in relation to the disappearance of Samantha Knight. He repeated that he had only met her two or three times and denied any knowledge of her disappearance. He also denied having assaulted her, or having taken indecent photographs of her. 21 When presented with the scrapbooks which had been recovered from the storage unit during the June 1998 search, he acknowledged that they were his and said that he had been mistaken in believing that they had been destroyed. He then disclosed that he had kept these three books because they were of interest to him. He explained that he did not think that police were looking in the right areas for Samantha, and said that her disappearance was a mystery about which he was determined to find out more, again making reference to other similar cases. 22 In the course of this interview, his attention was drawn to a series of pornographic slides and photographs taken on a night in mid 1985, when admittedly Samantha Knight was present with the 2 girls who were the subject of the offences which came before Judge O’Reilly. One of these photographs, showing the exposed genitals of a girl, was excluded as having related to those girls, and by inference it must have been a photograph of Samantha Knight. Additionally, several slides from this series were missing. The prisoner, when confronted with this, maintained his denial of having taken indecent photographs of her, or of having sexually assaulted her, repeating that he had nothing to hide concerning her. 23 Statements obtained from a number of witnesses were contradictory of the prisoners various accounts to police, both in 1996 and 1999, as to his contact with Samantha having being limited to the two or three occasions which he disclosed. 24 Subsequently he appeared before his Honour Judge O’Reilly in the District Court and pleaded guilty to 8 counts relating to these 2 girls which in summary involved 3 counts of indecent assault pursuant to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act, and 5 counts of sexual intercourse with a victim under the age of 16 years pursuant to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act. Nine other offences involving acts of indecency or incitement of such acts were taken into account on a Form 1. Absent admissions as to the giving of Normison to these two girls, no charges were preferred in relation to that potentially more serious offence.25 In his reasons for sentence, on 11 February 2000, Judge O’Reilly appropriately described these offences as “appalling”. He made reference to the prisoner’s current custodial position which required that he be held on protection, and to his dysfunctional background, the details of which had earlier been noted by Judge Flannery. His Honour found him to be a “compulsive paedophile”, and to have committed the offences while in a position of trust. 26 A conclusion was reached by his Honour, in circumstances where the further offences could have been dealt with by Judge Flannery, that there was little point in increasing the overall additional term.27 As a consequence, for the s 61D(1) offences concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment, each of 6 ½ years, were fixed to commence from 11 February 2000, and to expire on 10 August 2006, effectively extending the earliest date on which the prisoner would be eligible for parole by 6 months. In respect of each of the remaining counts, fixed terms of 12 months were imposed commencing on 11 February 2000 and expiring on 10 February 2001. 28 In the light of that background which I note in order to place the present offence of manslaughter in context, and to make proper allowance for the principle of totality, I return to the specific circumstances of that offence.29 The evidence before me shows that the prisoner first met Samantha Knight, and her mother Tess, in early February 1983 at a birthday picnic for one of the two girls who had been a victim in relation to the offences dealt with by Judge O’Reilly. As I have already observed Samantha had been a visitor to the home of that girl, and while there she had been photographed by the prisoner, during the years 1984 and 1985.30 In 1986 the family of that victim left the Sydney area, and in the same year Samantha and her mother moved to Bondi.31 On the afternoon of 19 August 1986, Samantha walked home after school, changed her clothes and then went out. She did not return by 6.00 pm, the time she was due back. Between 5.30 and 6.00 pm a number of witnesses saw her on Bondi Road near Wellington Street. Some said that she was in the presence of an adult male, who upon the Crown case was the prisoner. It is its case that he then took her to a location which has not been determined, and gave her Normison, most probably with the intention of taking indecent photographs of her. Tragically, she stopped breathing and died. The prisoner then disposed of her body. Samantha was at the time of her death only 9 years old.32 A prison witness, “N”, informed police that in 1996 while discussing the sex offences which had come before Judge Flannery, the prisoner said to him that police had also spoken to him in relation to Samantha Knight. He then added “well, I didn’t mean to do it. I must have given her too much”. He added “I must have put too much Normison in her coke and she wouldn’t wake up”. He also mentioned having photographs of her stored in a factory somewhere with his Aboriginal stones. It was the fact that the prisoner had a long standing interest in Aboriginal sites including burial sites and had a collection of artefacts and relics, some of which had been recovered during the police searches. 33 This witness asked him what he had done with the body, to which the prisoner replied “if the cops looked in Cooper Park they might have found her around the salt bushes in that place.”34 Further admissions were made to another prison inmate, “Witness O”, during 1998. In the course of this conversation , while acknowledging having given the girl a drug in his shed and later having discovered her dead, the prisoner made some observations suggestive of another man having been present and having assisted in burying the victim’s body. He also asserted that at a later time he had returned to the grave site where he had dug up the remains and placed them in a dumpster along with garden refuse near his place of work, which was then taken to a garbage depot. At the time he was working at the Royal Yacht Squadron at Kirribilli, as a gardener.35 Police made a search of the Cooper Park area, and of other areas where the prisoner had been working, but they were unable to find any trace of Samantha’s body.  
     
      
    36 As a result of extensive, and if I may say, dogged and impressively painstaking inquiries by police since the Task Force was formed, a body of circumstantial evidence was gathered in relation to the Prisoner’s involvement in the killing. He was eventually arrested and charged on 22 February 2001, and committed for trial on 29 April 2002. 37 The prisoner has not since his arrest provided any specific information to the police, or to the Court, in relation to the details of the offence, nor has he provided any firm information concerning the whereabouts of Samantha’s body. In particular he has not disclosed whether his meeting with her was a chance meeting or something which he had planned. While he has by his plea, admitted to having killed her, the details of the contact and what followed remain unknown. As I will mention later, I find this particularly disturbing. 38 The plea has been accepted in full discharge of the indictment, in that the Crown accepts that it cannot prove that the prisoner had any of the states of mind required for murder. It may be accepted that in the light of the way in which he had previously used Normison, it would have been impossible for it to show that he had intended, on this occasion, to kill Samantha, or to cause her grievous bodily harm. Nor would it have been possible to show that he had a realisation that the probable consequences of his act was her death. Additionally, it is accepted that the Crown, being unable to prove what he intended to do with Samantha, is not in a position to establish that his offence was one of felony murder. 39 In all of these circumstances, the Crown and the prisoner have acted appropriately in treating the offence as one of manslaughter, comprising an unlawful and dangerous act on his part, dangerousness being determined, for this offence, objectively rather than subjectively. The maximum available sentence available for the offence is accordingly one of imprisonment for 25 years. 40 As I have observed, the prisoner was charged with murder on 22 February 2001, and indicated an intention to plead guilty to manslaughter when appearing for arraignment on 7 June 2002. In the sense that he had a defence to murder, and did not know with certainty, until his arraignment, whether the Crown would accept a plea to manslaughter, that plea can be regarded as one that was offered at an early opportunity. On the other hand, he had been less than forthcoming in relation to the death of Samantha when spoken to by Police in 1996 and 1999, and he had continued to protest his innocence. Additionally he had not confronted the full extent of his criminality when appearing for sentence in the District Court before their Honours Judges Flannery and O’Reilly. On the contrary it was not until he was faced with the possibility of going on trial for the murder of Samantha Knight, that he finally accepted the additional criminality which he had been concealing for approximately 16 years. 41 Viewed objectively, the offence for which the prisoner be sentenced was gravely serious. It was submitted on his behalf that it did not, however, fall into a worst case category of manslaughter, since it was not a case involving an intent to cause harm, which might have been reduced to manslaughter by reason of provocation or substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  
     
      
    42 In that regard it was pointed out that the heaviest sentences passed for manslaughter tended to be those where specific intent, or reckless indifference, had been established, but the offence of murder which otherwise would have been made out, had been reduced to manslaughter by reason of one or other of the “defences” mentioned. 43 I accept that this is so, but it does not provide any basis for diminishing the objective seriousness of the present offence. An attempt to graduate the very many categories of conduct that can constitute manslaughter into descending orders of objective severity, and then to attempt to place a specific offence at any particular point either in the range for the relevant category or overall, would in my view be a fruitless exercise, by reason of the wide range of circumstances, objective and subjective, which this offence encompasses. 44 For similar reasons, the Judicial Commission statistics which were tendered, and which show that only 7% (or 10 cases) have attracted head sentences of 14 years or more, also provide little of assistance, since the statistical population of 173 cases embraces an enormously wide range of objective circumstances. They include events ranging from conduct involving momentary inattention causing death, to the deliberate infliction of death in circumstances of considerable violence or brutality where the offender’s responsibility is significantly impaired or diminished by abnormality of mind, or by reason of provocation: Regina v Maguire NSWCCA, 30 August 1995, and Regina v Alexander NSWCCA, 24 February 1995. 45 Since the offence does cover such a wide range of events, and outcomes ranging from non-custodial sentences to sentences proximate to those passed for some offences of murder, it has been recognised as notoriously posing difficulties for sentencing. Attempts at comparison with other cases are in fact largely unproductive unless substantially similar circumstances are shown to exist. No similar case has been identified. 46 The starting point for any consideration of the offence is that it is one which involves the felonious taking of human life, and for that reason it is a very serious crime: Regina v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value which the community places upon the preservation of life, and particularly that of young children, is reflected by the need to have conduct, which is involved in its taking, denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: Regina v Blacklidge NSWCCA 12 December 1995. 47 In the present instance, the objective seriousness of the offence cannot be assessed by reference to the provisions of the drug Normison to the child alone, as might be the case, for example, where a carer or health professional, in circumstances constituting gross negligence, prescribes or gives inappropriate medication to a child, in the mistaken belief that it will be of benefit. In this case the unlawful act must be understood as the deliberate supply of Normison to Samantha in order to render her unconscious, so that the prisoner could photograph her or possibly touch her in an indecent way.  
     
      
    48 Therein lies the gravity of his conduct, as is evident from his admitted long standing practice of using the drug for this purpose, and from his specific admission to Dr Westmore that he has given his victims Normison to “put them to sleep and I would take happy snaps, pictures of them which I would use for my own gratification later on.”49 There is no reason to suppose that the prisoner was aware of the risks associated with the drug Normison, which Professor Starmer described in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Normison is a commercial formulation of Temazepam. (a 1,4-benzodiazepine)… Temazepam is a sedative, hypnotic drug, which hastens the onset of sleep and increases total sleep time.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         .. 
         
         
        2. The acute side-effects which are commonly encountered after Temazepam administration are sedation, drowsiness, light-headedness, ataxia and lethargy... Less frequent side-effects (usually at higher doses) include confusion, as well as impaired mental and psychomotor function. Other side effects include bizarre behaviour, agitation, and hallucinations. Memory is often impaired and benzodiazepines are used clinically for their amnestic effects. The safety and effectiveness of Temazepam in children less than 16 years has not been established and its use is not recommended” 
        
       
      
    50 As Professor Starmer also noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. Temazepam does not have a pronounced taste and could probably be administered in Coca Cola without detection. It would be expected to produce sedation and, perhaps, poor recall of events which occurred when the individual was under the influence of the drug.” 
        
       
      
    51 In conclusion, he noted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “14. …the general awareness of a child could be readily reduced by the administration of Temazepam in relatively small doses”, and, he added Temazepam has “toxic effects in overdose”.  
        
       
      
    52 It is evident that the prisoner knew of the sedative effects of Normison, namely, that it induced sleep, reduced awareness, and affected memory. Those effects were obviously conducive to the performance of the activities which he found sexually gratifying, and I am satisfied that this was the reason for giving Samantha the drug after meeting her in the street, and taking her to another location. While the act of taking her away does not qualify as a forced abduction, it did involve a significant breach of the trust which she placed in him as a result of their prior association. 53 For the reasons already identified, relating to the wide variety of activities and circumstances that lead to manslaughter convictions, I regard any search for a worst case scenario, against which the present case should be measured, as quite illusory. Mercifully the present case is unique, at least in so far as the researches of counsel and myself are concerned. However viewed, and regardless of any comparison with the moral blame attaching to other killings, I consider that it is one involving an exceedingly grave degree of objective seriousness. It must be sentenced as such.54 The conduct involved was in fact abhorrent to all right thinking members of the community, and the sentence which is to be imposed must reflect a very strong element of general deterrence so as to convey to anyone, who is minded to engage in similar conduct, that he will receive a condign sentence. Equally of course it must reflect significant elements of retribution, punishment and personal deterrence for the prisoner, the latter so far as this was by no means the only occasion on which he has given Normison to young children, while satisfying his deviant sexual urges. 55 Of critical importance for sentencing the prisoner, is an assessment as to whether or not he has insight into his offending and as to whether he poses an appreciable ongoing danger to young children within the community. That turns upon an examination of his personal background and personality state, his history of offending, his own feelings in relation to this offence, the extent to which he has any genuine feelings of remorse, and his prospects of being rehabilitated through some form of therapeutic programme. 56 This is not an easy assessment both by reason of his dysfunctional background which was not of his own making - assuming as I must, in the absence of any contrary evidence, its truth - and by reason of the very limited disclosure which he has made concerning this offence.57 In this latter regard I observe that, notwithstanding the natural concern of the victim’s parents as to her whereabouts, he elected not to give evidence before me. Moreover, when examined by Dr Westmore for the purpose of obtaining a current psychiatric assessment, he claimed not to remember much of the incident because at the time he was “heavily into drugs”. When asked how many tablets he had given Samantha he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I can’t remember back…that day is particularly blank in my mind. I’ve obviously put it out of my mind. I have very vague recollections. I dissociate myself from aspects of my life that I have difficulties with.”  
        
       
       
        
        He went on to say that going to court was difficult for him and he said “ 
        Physically I’m in court but mentally I’m not there, I’m elsewhere, it’s the only way I can cope, I’ve always done this. That period of my life. Much of it’s a blur.” 
        
       
      
    58 Later he added: 
     
      
       
        
        “I never physically harmed the girl, I intended to take her home, it’s a very sad thing. It caught me by surprise that the drug had any effect like that. Naturally I panicked, I went into a, I knew I was in trouble and the other side of me took over, the protective side which tried to find some way out of the problem, disposing of the evidence I guess. I’ve blanked all of this out of my mind. I can’t be much more specific. A few years ago I might have been able to… but since then I’ve suffered a horrendous bashing on the head with an iron bar, I’ve never been the same again mentally, I’ve not been properly assessed and I’m terrified if I’m put into a cell with anyone because I think the same thing will happen.” 
        
       
      
     59 In the light of his obvious preoccupation with the case over the years, as disclosed by the interviews with police, and by the many conversations which other witnesses recalled, I find this part of the history given to Dr Westmore, and his failure to disclose precisely what occurred, to be disturbing. In my view it is indicative of a lack of remorse and of a failure to confront his offence. Additionally it is consistent with the manipulative and deceptive way in which he dealt with police in 1996 and 1999, and with the way in which he obviously disposed of and/or concealed evidence relating to Samantha’s death. 60 Since the clue to this part of his makeup and as to his future dangerousness almost certainly lies in his background, I will turn next to a consideration of his subjective circumstances.  
     
      
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    61 The prisoner was born on 20th October 1950 and is accordingly now aged almost 52 years. His background largely appears from the histories recorded in the various documents which were prepared in connection with the earlier sentencing proceedings, and from the history which he supplied more recently to Dr Westmore.  
     
      
    62 In summary, the prisoner informed the authors of these reports that he had become involved in incestuous behaviour with his mother, who is now deceased, and who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, while in primary school. He claimed to have been asked once by an adult who was a stranger to him to commit an act of indecency for money, and then to have been the subject of sexual abuse by other inmates, and by an approved visitor, after being placed in a boys home at about the age of 11 years. It was his memory that this visitor who took him on an excursion gave him some pills which had left him with only a vague awareness and memory of what had occurred. 63 The experience of being placed in this home, and later in another home, after being abandoned by his mother, was something which he described with some distress. While there he indicated that he also participated in the sexual abuse of other boys. 64 According to him he had no knowledge of his biological father. The man he referred to as his father allegedly had a problem with alcohol and gambling and had been physically abusive towards him. That man’s relationship with his mother, he said, had been difficult, and resulted in a separation at a time when he was 11 years old. His mother, he said, had died in her early fifties, after numerous psychiatric admissions. There was one other son of the relationship who had a prison record. There was another child in the family, whose paternity was uncertain, but who allegedly also had a prison record, psychiatric problems and a tendency to set fire to churches.  
     
      
    65 It was his account to Janet Devlin that before being detained in the boys home he had lived with his mother in various forms of charitable and community service housing as well as living for a time at Granville with the man he knew as his father. 66 He claimed to have enjoyed school until he had been sent to the boys home, but found that his performance then deteriorated. 67 After leaving these premises he worked as a copy boy, a clerical assistant, a storeman and packer, a labourer, a cleaner, and as a gardener. Despite his difficulties at school, he appears to have been quite intelligent and to have involved himself in a range of activities and interests, including the study of Aboriginal sites and culture, writing, reading, acting as an honorary ranger, horticulture, photography, and compulsively collecting articles and books on matters of interest. 68 He claimed to have had some adult heterosexual relationships, usually of a platonic nature, although one, which was more permanent, resulted in him setting fire to the business premises of this partner and her new lover, once his relationship with her broke up. For that offence, sentence was deferred in 1979 upon condition that the prisoner enter into a good behaviour bond for 5 years. He had earlier been placed upon a recognisance and fined for offences of stealing and false pretences. None of these matters however has any relevance for the present purposes due to their antiquity. 69 Notwithstanding his eclectic interests, he appears to have always been something of an introverted, avoidant, loner unable to commit to any long term relationships, regularly moving between various hostels, boarding houses or similar forms of accommodation, in the Sydney region. It was in the course of these moves that he came into contact with the various families whose trust he then abused. Clearly he felt more comfortable in the company of children, and regrettably they appear to have found him entertaining, in the way that reflects the classic modus operandi of a committed paedophile, who is quite unable to see the harm which he is causing and who professes to believe that the children involved are willing if not active participants, whose well being is unaffected. 70 He also claimed to have developed an alcohol and drug habit, using Normison, cough medicines, prescription pills, cannabis and LSD. He has never received any formal psychiatric treatment for his problems, although he has now completed the preliminary assessment required for admission, in due course, to a sex offender program. He has had some history, so he says, of physical illness in the form of cardiac difficulties due to earlier heavy alcohol intake, hepatitis A, and hypertension, for which conditions he is receiving medication. He certainly appears older than his chronological age, although that may well be due to the rigours of prison life, and the dangers to which he has been exposed while in custody and which have seen him assaulted more than once. 71 Two circumstances appear to me to be of direct significance in relation to the question whether the prisoner actually has insight and remorse for what he did to Samantha, and in relation to the further question whether he presents as a continuing risk to young children. 72 The first is the fact which I have already mentioned that the prisoner has kept to himself what in fact occurred in relation to Samantha. This I regard as quite damning and as an unfavourable indicator for the future. 73 The second concerns the circumstance that the agreed facts placed before Judge Flannery show that the prisoner gave Normison to four victims, who I shall refer to by their initials, subsequent to the occasion which led to the death of Samantha. In summary they were AC (Count 48), CH (Count 29), AH (Counts 23 to 25) and RH (Count 40). In the light of the death of Samantha, the continued use by the prisoner of Normison, in association with indecent touching and/or photography in relation to other children, on occasions which were charged as having occurred between 1989 and 1995, I regard as a significant indicator that he continues to present as a danger to children. 74 If he truly felt remorse or contrition for what he had done, then it is inconceivable that he could have exposed other children to the same danger that led to Samantha’s death. 75 These considerations do need to be considered in the light of the reports which were tendered from 2 psychiatrists Drs Westmore and Carne, from 2 psychologists, Janet Devlin and Mr G Farthers, the pre-sentence report prepared for the proceedings before Judge Flannery, and the prison records comprising the Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC) reports and the various certificates in relation to courses which the prisoner has undertaken whilst in custody. 76 Mr Farthers, who interviewed the prisoner on three occasions in February 1996, described him as a man who had maintained a fairly stable lifestyle, albeit on the fringe, with a secretive sexual life and a tendency to fantasy. He was seen as having a depressive style and an ability to meet problems by withdrawal and compartmentalisation of issues and of other people. Mr Farthers described him as a social isolate, whose major feature on personality testing was a thought disturbance reflecting disorganised thinking and confusion. He said that he fitted the typical description of the non-violent paedophile, and was in need of treatment. 77 Of some concern in relation to his insight into the nature of his paedophile tendencies was his observation to Mr Farthers that the girls who had been the victims of the offences then known had joined in his activities, indulged themselves and enjoyed the naughtiness of what they were doing.78 It was the impression, similarly, of the author of the March 1996 pre-sentence report, that the prisoner appeared to minimise his responsibilities, and in addition, mitigated his behaviour by alluding to his own dysfunctional family background. To the author of this report he acknowledged having had a history of being drawn to children over a period of more than 30 years. If that is true, then it underlines the pervasiveness of his deviancy and presents something of an obstacle to effective treatment. 79 Dr Jonathan Carne who saw the prisoner in March 1996, was of the opinion that he was suffering from the disorder of paedophilia which he had developed, on the background of a personality in which he had a reduced capacity for normal close relationships. Treatment, he indicated, was available through regular psychiatric assessment, psychological techniques, and the use of anti-androgen medication. 80 Prior to appearing for sentence in 2000, the prisoner was reviewed by Janet Devlin. It was her conclusion that the prisoner’s 
     
      
       
        
        “family circumstances and experiences during his youth contributed to the development of a poorly adjusted individual, given to a sense of childlike specialness even as an adult by the nature of the relationship with his mother, and simultaneously psychosexually impaired by the experience. It is likely that this played the most significant role in his deviant sexual behaviour and the literature suggests that mother-son incest may have greater emotional and other sequelae than other forms of sexual abuse.” 
        
       
      
    81 She added that he  
     
      
       
        
        “became an introverted, socially avoidant and somewhat depressive individual, who likely felt inadequate in the company of adult women and men. It is possible that the paranoid and schizoid traits he displays which may explain some of his behaviour derives from a genetic vulnerability (given his report of the nature of his mother’s illness), but that the many other risk factors in his history, including various forms of abuse and neglect equally contributed to his distorted world view. There was no evidence of cognitive dysfunction contributing to his failure to control his impulses with respect to child sex offending.” 
        
       
      
    82 As to the future, she identified the following factors as those which may mitigate against successful rehabilitation: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    q “substantial history of adversity and trauma during childhood, including multiple forms of abuseq Personality disorder, especially avoidant natureq Depressive illness and past suicidal ideation and attemptsq History of drug and alcohol abuseq Offence historyq Compulsive sexual behaviour with limited therapeutic intervention.” 
     
      
       
      
    83 The factors which she said may contribute to successful rehabilitation were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    q “Normal intellect and cognitive functioningq Some dysfunctional personality traits but little evidence of overtly aggression (sic)q Currently drug and alcohol free with no reported adversityq Wishes to undertake sex offender programmeq Commenced long term individual psychosexual/educational interventionq Adverse events within prison may constitute a further probative factor against further offendingq Goals and future orientation re studies”84 Dr Westmore suggested that the prisoner’s sexual dysfunction had developed most significantly after his single long term relationship had broken down (in about 1979), and added that there were significant unresolved issues to do with his history of incest and abandonment. 85 His psychosexual disturbance Dr Westmore thought was suggestive of a  
     
      
       
        
        “broad one involving primarily  
        paedophilia 
         but also a  
        fetish 
         and a form of  
        voyeurism 
         (the pictures). In addition he also qualifies for the diagnosis of  
        substance abuse (in remission) 
        .” 
        
       
      
    86 Dr Westmore added: 
     
      
       
        
        “He is presenting as a tearful and depressed man. My provisional diagnosis is that he has an  
        adjustment disorder with symptoms of depression and anxiety 
        . The differential diagnosis would include a  
        major depressive illness 
         although that is less likely I think. 
         
         
        Because of the nature and extent of his psychological and psychosexual problems, his prognosis needs to be considered in a very cautious and guarded manner. Although he appears well motivated to participate in a treatment programme, he has not had the benefit of attending such a programme to date and it is unclear whether or not any impact on his psychosexual problems will be made with such a programme. The other issue of major concern is his history of using drugs to sedate his victims. This obviously placed them at great risk and even further increased their vulnerability and his capacity to abuse them.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    87 Dr Westmore agreed with Ms Devlin’s summary of the points for and against rehabilitation. 88 The various diplomas and certificates tendered do show that the prisoner has used his time in prison as might be hoped, in the case of a prisoner who is serving a long sentence, and who has an interest in intellectual activities, by undertaking a wide variety of courses. None of these courses, with one exception, would seem designed to address his problems which do not relate to educational difficulties, or problems with anger or problem resolution, but rather turn upon sexual deviancy. 89 The SORC documents show that he has never presented as a management or behavioural problem, that he has been consistently keen to advance his education, involving the several external university courses which he has successfully undertaken, that he has engaged in bible studies, and that he has kept in regular contact with psychological services. He has however so far only been able to undertake one preliminary educational course in relation to sexual offending. By reason of his existing sentence, and the sentence now to be imposed, it has not been possible for him to undertake the CUBIT programme so that its potential benefits for him cannot yet be assessed. 90 In the light of the various matters outlined, I am of the view that notwithstanding the positive aspects of his prison record, the prisoner’s remorse and contrition for the offence is very limited, and such concern as he does have is more for his current predicament. I am satisfied, to the criminal standard, by reason of his limited remorse, his personality deficiencies, his capacity for manipulation, his continued use of Normison upon young children, the pervasiveness of his conduct, which can only be categorised as that of a compulsive and committed paedophile who has little, if any, insight into the consequences of his behaviour, that he remains a serious danger to the community.91 While paedophilia is recognised as a disorder, unlike other forms of mental disorder, it does not provide any reason for mitigating the objective severity of the present offence. Similarly while the dysfunctional and troubled background of the prisoner may go some of the way to explain why he became a paedophile, it does not excuse his offending. 92 It is true that the various forms of treatment for paedophilia are available, yet in any given case, it might be expected that moderation or control of offending behaviour will depend upon the pervasiveness and strength of the deviant sexual urges, and upon the commitment and strength of the offender to adhere to the program and/or medication, and to abandon what essentially was for him a matter involving pleasure and the gratification of strong sexual urges. I believe that I am entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that the recidivism rate for such offenders is high.  
     
      
    93 My assessment of the prisoner’s personality, background, and lifestyle to date, as recorded in the experts reports and taking into account the factors identified by Ms Devlin, leaves me with little confidence that he would be able to respond positively to any such program. He is of course entitled to access to it. 94 This then is a case to which the principles in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1968) 164 CLR 465 at 472 to 473 apply. While preventative detention is impermissible nevertheless the need to protect society, where a risk of dangerousness is found to exist, can properly be taken into account in structuring the sentence. 95 The prisoner is entitled to some reduction for the plea of guilty. He is also entitled to have taken into account the fact that he will be required to serve the sentence upon strict protection, and will continue to be subject to the problems which inevitably face those who are convicted of offences involving young children, and which can never be totally eliminated: R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 294. The early plea clearly had a utilitarian value in saving the community the cost of a trial, and as such it can be called in aid by the prisoner in accordance with the decisions in Regina v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and Regina v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142. The case is however one where some moderation of the discount is appropriate by reason of the need for the sentence to take into account the protection of the public – as to which see the observations of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Thomson and Houlton at paras 157-159, and the decision in Regina v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 358.  
     
      
    96 It may also be accepted that by his plea the prisoner has displayed some acceptance of his responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice in the way noted in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6.97 The case clearly is one to which the principle of totality applies, since it occurred within the time span encompassing the other offences in respect of which the prisoner is already serving time: Griffiths v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 372 at 393. The effect of the previous sentencing orders is that the prisoner currently has a maximum existing sentence which is not due to expire until 27 February 2012, and an earliest possible parole release date of 10 August 2006. 98 In accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, I must pronounce a sentence, which is appropriate for the objective and subjective circumstances of the current offence, and then ensure that an appropriate commencement date is fixed which will reflect the principle of totality. In a case such as the present, it is common ground that the appropriate course is to provide a partial accumulation of sentence, by backdating to the date on which the plea of guilty was entered, namely 7 June 2002. 99 Having regard to the length of the sentence, the issues which the prisoner will have to address, the limitations as to rehabilitation options and opportunities which exist in the case of prisoners on protection, and the need for long term supervision, monitoring and support, both in the interests of the prisoner and of the community, I am persuaded that special circumstances exist, in accordance with the principles discussed in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 to justify some small variation of the statutory ratio between the non parole period and head sentence. 100 In the light of these findings, I sentence you, Michael Anthony Guider, for the manslaughter of Samantha Knight, to imprisonment for 17 years to date from 7 June 2002 and to expire on 6 June 2019. I fix a non parole period of 12 years, similarly to date from 7 June 2002 and to expire on 6 June 2014. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will accordingly be 7 June 2014.101 I recognise that statistically this is one of the longest sentences handed down in relation to the offence of manslaughter. I am driven to it by the aggravating circumstances which I have mentioned. However, it is so structured as to ensure long term supervision and monitoring, and to test whether the prisoner is able to respond positively once admitted to the Cubit programme.  
     
      
    102 Before leaving this matter I consider it appropriate to emphasise that the use of stupefying drugs so as to engage an unsuspecting victim, whether a child or adult, in sexual activity, constitutes a particularly serious form of criminality. If the purpose of the offender is to have sexual intercourse with the victim then the available maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. If death ensues from overdose, or adverse reaction, following administration of such a drug, then the offender will have committed at least manslaughter, as occurred in the present case, and possibly murder, depending on his purpose. The offence of murder attracts the penalty of imprisonment for life.

     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 25 March 1999, John Reginald Killick was an inmate of Silverwater Gaol. He escaped from that gaol by helicopter on that day. The helicopter had been flown to the gaol by a pilot who was forced to land by a woman. The principal issue in the trial was whether or not the Appellant was that woman. When Killick was subsequently apprehended he was in the company of the Appellant. Certain pistols were found on that occasion and some of the charges relate to that discovery. 
      
       
     2 The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the five counts with which she was charged. The jury convicted her on all counts. The counts were: 
      
       
        
       Count 1: Rescue inmate in lawful custody by force contrary to s32 of the  
       Correctional Services Act  
       1952 
       . 
        
        
       Court 2: Assault member of crew of an aircraft contrary to s206(a) of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900. 
        
        
       Count 3: Detain for advantage contrary to s90A of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900. 
        
        
       Counts 4 & 5: Unauthorised possession of a firearm, in each case a pistol, contrary to s7(1) of the  
       Firearms Act 
        1996. 
        
       
     3 The sentencing judge imposed the following sentences: 
      
       
        
       Count 1: Imprisonment for a term of ten years with a non-parole of seven years. 
        
        
       Count 2: Imprisonment for a term of ten years with a non-parole of seven years. 
        
        
       Count 3: Imprisonment for a fixed term of five years. 
        
        
       Counts 4 & 5: Imprisonment for fixed terms of three years. 
        
       
     4 All of the sentences commenced on 9 May 1999, being the date on which the Appellant was taken into custody. The maximum penalty for each of Counts 1 to 3 was fourteen years. The maximum penalty for Counts 4 and 5 was ten years. 
      
       
     5 The Appellant commenced a de facto relationship with Killick in late 1997. Killick was taken into custody on 21 January 1999 and remained there until his escape. He had been refused bail in relation to two counts of armed robbery and one count of shooting at a person. 
      
       
     6 The Crown case was that on the morning of Thursday, 25 March 1999, the Appellant attended the office of Helicopters Pty Ltd at Bankstown Airport to partake in a joyflight in a Bell 47 helicopter VH-AET. The flight was booked for 9.15am and the pilot was Timothy John Joyce. It was to fly on what was known as the “Harbour Bridge Track”, which included a flypass of the Olympic Stadium and Village, Sydney Harbour and Manly. The Appellant had also taken a previous ‘practice flight’ on 8 March 1999, along the same Harbour Bridge track with the same company. 
      
       
     7 The Appellant arrived in an agitated state carrying what appeared to be shopping bags that she insisted on taking with her into the helicopter. The flight commenced and proceeded to the Olympic Stadium where the Appellant requested that the pilot fly over the Silverwater Gaol that was to the north of the Olympic Village. She requested the pilot to fly lower over the Gaol and when he refused, pulled a pistol out of her purse, pointed at his head and said: “This is a hijack”. 
      
       
     8 She prevented the pilot from activating the hijack or emergency frequency transponders and switched off all the radios within the helicopter. She then pulled out and assembled a larger gun that the pilot believed to be some kind of automatic weapon and loaded it with an ammunition container. She instructed the pilot to descend into the gaol and land on one of the playing fields in the grounds.  
      
       
     9 As the helicopter landed, one prisoner ran towards the helicopter, stood on the skids and took the larger weapon from the Appellant and pointed it at the pilot. The prisoner was Killick. The Crown relied on the fact that only one prisoner ran towards the helicopter as an indication that the escape was planned in advance. The Appellant then produced a number of pages from the UBD street directory with a line drawn on them from the gaol to the Macquarie University area and directed the pilot to fly to Macquarie University and land on an oval. Mr Joyce was tied up and left in the helicopter.  
      
       
     10 The Appellant and Killick ran from the oval to a nearby car park where they threatened Peter Bax with one of the weapons, got into his car and forced him to drive them to Kurraba Road in North Sydney. After this they forced Mr Bax out of the car and drove away. This conduct was said to constitute the third count of kidnapping.11 A search of the premises of Gloria Killick where the Appellant had been residing was conducted on 25 March 1999 as part of police inquiries into Killick’s escape. At the flat detectives seized various videos which depicted escapes from prison, a straw hat which resembled one worn by the Appellant during the rescue and pages from brochures that included pictures of a helicopter and Sydney Harbour Bridge. 12 The Appellant and Killick were on the run until they were arrested at about 2.00am on Sunday, 9 May 1999, in Cabin 14 of the Bass Hill Tourist Park. The police found within the cabin two pistols, one a Derringer style and the other a Luger style. The Derringer was cocked and loaded with two bullets. Hats and a wig were also found along with a lady’s handbag containing identification papers bearing the name Dudko. The presence of the two firearms in the cabin gave rise to Counts 4 and 5 on the indictment.13 The Appellant’s case was primarily directed to the issue of identification. It was the Appellant’s contention at trial that a professional hijacker had been involved in rescuing the prisoner Killick and that her first contact with Killick on 25 March 1999 was when he collected her from a roundabout in Milsons Point. She had been aware of his intention to escape and pursuant to instructions that he had given her had booked a room in a motel for two nights and left Killick’s mobile phone in a park at about 8.00pm on the night before the escape.  
      
       
     14 The Appellant gave evidence that Killick had spoken to her on a number of occasions about escaping, the last time being on 24 March 1999, i.e. the day before the escape. She said that she did not take him seriously. Nevertheless when he asked her on 24 March to undertake the various tasks, she performed them because she had promised to do so. She gave evidence that on the following morning she waited at a roundabout in North Sydney for about thirty to forty minutes as he had requested her to do. However, when Killick arrived driving a motor vehicle with no other passenger, she claimed to have been shocked. 
      
       
     15 After he collected her from the roundabout, they drove to North Sydney train station where they purchased train tickets and she travelled alone back to the motel. At this point she said, she saw her face on television heard the report asserting that she had assisted Killick to escape from the prison. She felt that she could no longer return home because of her implication in the event.16 The Appellant’s case was that thereafter the two of them were on the run, travelling through various country towns and staying in motels, before arriving in Melbourne. They eventually obtained a lift back to Sydney with a man named John whom the Appellant claimed was the owner of the two guns and of the wig found with the Appellant and Killick at their cabin at Bass Hill. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        
        
         
         “The profuse amount of pre-trial publicity with me as the subject matter was so distorted, biased and disparaging that it justifies a conclusion that it created prejudice in the minds of at least some of the jurors, thus causing a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     17 There is no doubt that the requirements of a fair trial are a paramount consideration in the administration of criminal justice. The Appellant relied on a volume of publicity which was supplied to the Court. The publicity was plainly prejudicial in the sense that it proclaimed her guilt in no uncertain terms. On numerous occasions her photograph was published in a context clearly identifying her as the woman in the helicopter. As would be expected, the publicity was most intensive in the immediate wake of the escape itself. However, there was continuing reference in the media which, over time became increasingly sporadic and generally less prominent. It continued as late as December 2000 when Killick was sentenced for the offences associated with his escape, although references to the Appellant were not prominent and by that time often accompanied by terminology such as “alleged accomplice”. Nevertheless she was named in some media reporting in a period proximate to her trial in March 2001. 
      
       
     18 An application was made to the trial judge for a permanent stay of proceedings on the basis of the pre-trial publicity. Her Honour rejected the application. She referred to authorities in the High Court on this matter, particularly Glennon v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 592 and Murphy v The Queen (1988) 167 CLR 94. Her Honour acknowledged the principle that there may be an exceptional case in which a permanent stay was appropriate. However, she reached the conclusion that, with proper directions to the jury, the Appellant would receive a fair trial. Her Honour rejected the application. 
      
       
     19 Issues of this character have arisen on many occasions in which extensive publicity had been given to particular cases involving clear implications of guilt. Glennon involved a Roman Catholic priest who was convicted of sexual offences against a girl. Murphy involved the Anita Cobby murderers. Other cases include the case of Ivan Milat (see R v Milat, NSWCCA, 26 February 1998 (unreported)), the “Mr Bubbles” child sexual abuse case (see R v VPH, NSWCCA, 4 March 1994 (unreported), the paedophile Phillip Bell (see R v Bell, NSWCCA, 8 October 1998 (unreported)), the child sexual assaults committed by a former member of the Queensland parliament (see R v D’Arcy [2001] QCA 325) and the Childers backpacker fire (see Long v R [2002] QSC 54). None of these cases satisfied the test of exceptionality, despite the intensity of the media publicity involved. 
      
       
     20 The scope and intensity of the publicity in the present case was of a similar order of magnitude to those considered in these cases. The assertions of guilt in the present case were, particularly in the early publicity, perhaps more consistent and forceful than in the other cases to which I have referred. However, those assertions were particularly prominent in the immediate wake of the escape and became more sporadic and less prominent over time. The worst of the publicity occurred almost two years before the trial itself. 
      
       
     21 The authorities to which I have referred establish that even in circumstances of a crime of a high level of notoriety, where it would probably not be possible to select a jury panel who had not heard about the case and indeed who may have a tentative opinion, the trial must still proceed. Jurors who may have formed an opinion are not necessarily biased in the relevant sense. There is now a substantial body of judicial statements of the opinion that jurors accept their responsibility to perform their duties by differentiating between the evidence and what they may have heard before the trial. 
      
       
     22 Her Honour gave clear and forceful directions to the jury in this regard. Inter alia she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “No doubt, you may well have a recollection of this matter when it was in the media, either television or newspapers or magazines. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to receive a fair trial that you will consider therefore this case on the material before you and the material before you alone. You must not bring to consideration in this matter any preconceived views or ideas about the matter from what you may recall hearing or seeing at or around that time of March through to May of 1999 or even later if you [have] any recollection of any other matter touching this particular case appearing in the media. I cannot stress that more strongly than I have. You must not allow any outside influences [to] affect your consideration of the matter because you have sworn to return a verdict in accordance with the evidence and as I say, the evidence will come from witnesses and any other material tendered as exhibits.” 
         
        
       
     23 In my opinion in the light of these directions, and other observations to similar effect that her Honour made, the Appellant was not denied a fair trial. This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
        
         
         “Her Honour failed to exercise her discretion in a fair and proper manner by choosing not to question juror panels as to media-created bias, thus placing me in jeopardy of being tried by jurors unable to exercise their property duty due to being influenced by impermissible knowledge.” 
         
        
       
     24 The Appellant referred to other occasions on which a trial judge had interrogated a jury panel concerning their knowledge of the circumstances of the offence. Nothing of that character was sought in the present case. The Appellant was represented by experienced Counsel who made an application for a stay and otherwise made submissions to the trial judge on the subject. 
      
       
     25 In the present case it seemed quite likely that every member of the jury panel would have heard something about the incident. The circumstances of the escape were dramatic and such as to attract maximum media publicity. No application was made for a process to be conducted of the character, the absence of which is now complained of. It would require leave to raise this question. In my view leave should be refused. In any event her Honour, after submissions, made clear and forceful directions and as I have said there is no reason to think that a process of the character for which the Appellant now contends would have had any greater effect. Even if leave were granted this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
        
         
         “The learned judge at trial failed to direct jury as to the elements required to be established beyond reasonable doubt to constitute the offence charged. Therefore the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory because on the evidence no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt about the appellant rescued the prisoner by force because there is no evidence to support these allegations.” 
         
        
       
     26 The relevant offence was created by s32 of the Correctional Centres Act 1952: 
      
       
        
         
         “32 Any person who, by force, rescues or attempts to rescue from lawful custody any inmate shall be guilty of a felony and shall be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding fourteen years.” 
         
        
       
     27 It is material to compare this provision with s33 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “33 Any person who: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) aids an inmate in escaping or attempting to escape from lawful custody, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) conveys anything or causes anything to be conveyed into a correctional centre or correctional complex or to an inmate with intent to facilitate the escape of an inmate 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         shall be guilty of a felony and shall be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years.” 
         
        
       
     28 The significance of the reference to “by force” in s32 is found in the maximum penalty of fourteen years, in contrast with the maximum of seven years for aiding escape for which s33 provides. 
      
       
     29 There is no doubt that her Honour directed the jury that it had to be satisfied as an element of the offence that the accused had “forcibly rescued” or “forcibly liberated” Killick. The word “force” is an ordinary English word. It is used in that sense in s32. The Appellant’s complaint that her Honour failed to direct the jury “on the legal meaning of the word ‘force’” should be rejected. No such direction was called for.  
      
       
     30 In the course of the trial the element of “force” was not an issue. The trial concentrated on the question of whether or not the Appellant was the woman. The Appellant referred to cases such as Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 for the proposition that there are circumstances in which a trial judge must direct a jury with respect to matters, even though Counsel for the accused does not raise the issue and even if counsel refused to do so for good reason. Nevertheless, the directions a trial judge should give must depend on the issues at the trial.  
      
       
     31 The Appellant seeks to contend, under this ground of appeal, that it is a necessary component of the offence under s32 that the “force” to which that section refers must be applied in some way towards an employee or to the property of the prison. 
      
       
     32 There was evidence in the trial that the escapee Killick dissuaded prison officers who were approaching the helicopter by pointing a gun at them and that that gun had been handed to him by the woman in the helicopter. (See transcript 178-183, 184-185 and 191-193) It may very well have been contended that the act of giving the gun to Killick and her continued participation satisfied the requirement of “force” on the part of the Appellant within the meaning of s32, even though she did not point the gun at this point. If this legal issue had been raised at the trial, the Crown could very well have contended that the requirement of “force” on the part of the Appellant was satisfied on the facts. 
      
       
     33 However, the trial was conducted on the basis that the relevant force was that applied to the helicopter pilot. Her Honour said (at p18 of her summing-up): 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no doubt that you might think, and which has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, that someone forcibly rescued John Killick from that Correctional Centre. The issue that must be decided by you is, was the accused the person who was in the helicopter holding a gun at the head of the pilot and forcing that pilot to land so Mr Killick could climb aboard and be flown away. Now those are the two elements that must be proved and proved beyond reasonable doubt. As I say it would seem that the only issue for you on that charge is, was that the accused who forcibly rescued Killick.” 
         
        
       
     34 Section 32 directs attention to a causal relationship between the application of the “force” and either a “rescue” or “attempt to rescue”. Nothing in s32 directs attention to the person or persons to whom the force is to be applied. No doubt, the usual case of a prison escape will involve force applied to prison officers. In this respect the present circumstances were unusual and perhaps unique. The causal relationship between the application of the “force” and the “rescue” was, in the special circumstances of this case, the application of force to the helicopter pilot. It was that force which led to the “rescue”. There was a sufficient causal connection for purposes of s32. 
      
       
     35 In my view this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     36 The Appellant made some submissions pursuant to this ground of appeal in the context of the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” submission concerning an issue of double jeopardy between Counts 1 and 2. This is a matter that is also raised in the submissions on sentence and it is convenient to consider it separately at that point. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
        
        
         
         “Her Honour misdirected the jury in replying to a question regarding in court identification and again later regarding a question from the jury concerning direction of identification, this causing a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     37 The relevant question asked by the jury was: 
      
       
        
         
         “… Under what circumstances can a barrister direct attention of the witness to the accused and ask is that the person that you saw?” [Transcript p402] 
         
        
       
     38 There was a lengthy debate about how this question should be answered. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that telling the jury anything at all in answer to the question would put the accused in a worse position than if the identification evidence had in fact been admitted. Her Honour informed the jury that the rules of evidence and procedure concerning in court identification had been followed in the case and that the jury should not be concerned with what those rules are or to speculate about them. She emphasised that the jury had to have regard to the evidence before them. The reasons advanced by counsel for the Appellant for not answering the jury’s questions were understandable. Nothing in the Appellant’s submissions cause me to have any doubt that it was the appropriate stance and her Honour’s direction was entirely appropriate. The submissions to this Court are based on the possibility of the jury speculating on these matters which is, of course, precisely what her Honour told them not to do. 
      
       
     39 Pursuant to this ground the Appellant also objected to the reply to another jury question which was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defence raised in the summing-up that no-one was able to directly identify Dudko as the hijacker or abductor of Bax. Why was no other witness called to give direct identification. Your Honour advised us that this was a matter of law and should not be subject to our speculation, however the defence did specifically raise this point and we would like direction as to how we should regard the defence claim.” [Summing-up p129] 
         
        
       
     40 With respect to this question counsel for the Appellant submitted that the judge should direct the jury that evidence of identification is only permissible in situations in which the law regards the identification as reliable and fair to the accused. He noted that in the course of the summing-up the trial judge had reminded the jury that there was no identification evidence before them. He asked that the jury be directed to the effect that, there being no identification evidence, their obligation was to reach a verdict looking at the evidence and nothing else.  
      
       
     41 The Crown Prosecutor identified the error which appeared on the face of the jury’s question, namely that “The defence raised … that no-one was able to directly identify Dudko”. The Crown Prosecutor said that that was an interpretation by one or more members of the jury of the submission made by defence counsel. However, that submission was: there had not in fact been any identification evidence. No submission had been made in terms that “no-one was able to directly identify” the Appellant. Further submissions were made by both the prosecution and the defence on the difficulty that had arisen in this respect. The Crown insisted that the answer to the question should correct the mistaken assumption reflected in the questions.  
      
       
     42 During the course of the submissions the following transpired: 
      
       
        
         
         “Her Honour: That what Mr Stratton has said is that there was no – well indeed I don’t think Mr Stratton ever said there was no-one able to identify the witness -  
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton: Your Honour I specifically didn’t say that. 
         
        
        
         
         Her Honour: - and identify the accused, I’ll just check and see what exactly the way I have it. 
         
        
        
         
         Crown Prosecutor: I’m equally confident with your Honour and my friend that was not said. 
         
        
        
         
         Her Honour: Right I’m just looking just to – what I understood to happen was that the – you have not heard a single witness was identified in truth, that was it not able, I don’t think you ever said able. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton: I didn’t say able to, my memory was that there was no evidence of identification and that’s why in the draft which I’ve now reduced to writing and I’ve just handed it to my friend, I’ve attempted to as it were correct that and it may be that the draft which I’ve prepared even would leave it open to the jury to infer that the witnesses might have been able to identify the accused but makes it clear that the law wouldn’t permit it. Could I hand up, it’s produced into writing what I think I’ve already put to your Honour verbally but could I hand up something that I’ve just written out.” 
         
        
       
     43 This Court does not have before it the document that was handed up. It appears that the first paragraph of the direction proposed by defence counsel was accepted. Then her Honour indicated (at 126 of the summing-up) that she would direct the jury in accordance with that paragraph. The first paragraph of what her Honour actually said in this respect to the jury is the matter now complained of. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, what the defence submission was, was that there was no evidence of identification of the accused in the case. The defence did not say that no-one was able to directly identify the person. The submission was simply that there was no evidence of identification of the accused in this case, and that is correct, because this is a case which has been conducted by the Crown as a circumstantial evidence case.” [at 129 of summing-up] 
         
        
       
     44 That this was the passage which was handed to her Honour by defence counsel is, in my opinion, confirmed by the reference her Honour made at 126 of the transcript: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think I’m going to say, really, that I’m quite happy with that first point that Mr Stratton’s made or say that Mr Stratton was entitled to say that, but this is a case in which it has been run on the basis of circumstantial evidence. I’ve told them that time and time again, it is not an identification case.” 
         
        
       
     45 Even if I were wrong and counsel for the Appellant had not proposed the very formulation now complained of, this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     46 The Appellant submits that the comment could give rise to speculation in the minds of the jurors to the effect that there were other witnesses or evidence of which they were unaware. Such speculation would have been contrary to the directions her Honour had given on a number of occasions. The passage objected to, namely the statement that “the defence did not say that no-one was able to directly identify the person”, did not involve any element of unfairness by reason of the fact that it was responsive to the incorrect assertion of fact contained in the jury question itself. It was the jury that had asserted: “The defence raised in the summing-up that no-one was able to directly identify Dudko …” and that assertion was wrong. A fair trial includes fairness to the Crown. Her Honour was entitled to point out the error in the question and remind the jury of the actual submission made by the defence.

         “The evidence of MRRC telephone records, a photograph of a Luger pistol with butt attached and evidence of Mr Ayad were received in error and should have been excluded.” 
         
        
       
     47 The evidence of the telephone records tendered by the Crown had two aspects. Both were documents produced from a computer. First, there was an inmate audit trail in which was recorded the names and telephone numbers on a prisoner’s autodial card. The card was issued to inmates who were then required to complete a form nominating up to six numbers to be encoded on the card. Those telephone numbers were allocated codes 1 to 6 respectively on the card. An inmate wishing to contact one of those telephone numbers would enter a booth at the Remand Centre, enter his inmate number and then a PIN to access his autodial card. The destination number was selected by pressing the corresponding code number and the system would then dial the appropriate telephone number. Inmates could not independently dial telephone numbers. 
      
       
     48 In order to change one of the coded numbers, an inmate would complete a form nominating the new names and numbers which were then entered onto the telephone system by an officer of the Remand Centre. The inmate audit trail identified the names and numbers nominated by the inmate and any changes made to the card since the inmate was admitted. The names and numbers were not checked by Centre officials nor was there any verification that, when a certain number was dialled, the person nominated was the one who took the call. 
      
       
     49 The second set of documents was a record generated by computer of the destination numbers and duration of calls made by a particular inmate, Killick, on the autodial system. The cost of calls was charged to inmates. 
      
       
     50 The admissibility of this evidence was challenged by counsel for the Appellant and determined on a voir dire. Counsel’s only objection was to the inclusion of the names supplied by Killick as corresponding to the numbers entered on the system. The Appellant seeks to challenge the admissibility of the whole of this evidence on the basis that it does not meet the exception to the hearsay rule for business records in s69 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
      
       
     51 The documents tendered contain two kinds of evidence. The first kind is direct evidence that certain calls were made by the inmate Killick to certain telephone numbers on certain dates for a specified duration. The evidence is the record in the computer system which monitors the phone calls at the Remand Centre. 
      
       
     52 Section 48(1)(d) of the Evidence Act provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A party may adduce evidence of the contents of a document in question by tendering the document in question or by any one or more of the following methods: 
         
        
        
         
         …. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) if the document in question is an article or thing on or in which information is stored in such a way that it cannot be used by the court unless a device is used to retrieve, produce or collate it---tendering a document that was or purports to have been produced by use of the device,” 
         
        
        
       s48(1)(d) thus permits the tendering of a document produced by a computer as evidence of the contents of the computer record. 
        
       
     53 Section 147 of the Evidence Act provides that evidence of this character, which forms part of the records of a business or is kept for the purposes of a business, is presumed to have been accurately produced by the device which makes the record. 
      
       
     54 The definition of a business is in Clause 1 Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act and includes: 
      
       
        
         
         “(b) an activity engaged in or carried on by the Crown in any of its capacities,” 
         
        
        
       The MRRC is thus relevantly a “business”, and the records within the Centre computer, created for the purpose of charging inmates for outgoing calls, are records kept and produced for the purposes of that business, so defined. 
        
       
     55 The second kind of evidence is the record of representations made by Killick that when he dialled certain telephone numbers through the autodial system, he was contacting the people nominated as corresponding to those numbers. The records of that information were maintained for the purposes of the “business” of the MRRC. 
      
       
     56 The evidence of that record, produced through a document pursuant to s48(1)(d) as described above, infringes the hearsay rule in s59 of the Evidence Act. Section 69 provides an exception for a document containing a business record in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “(2) 
           
          The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact.” 
         
        
       
     57 The representation in the record adduced by the Crown at trial was that of Killick. It was either a representation made by him, as a person who might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the identities of those people who belonged to the numbers which he had nominated for his autodial card. Alternatively, the representation was made by the officer who entered the information into the computer, in reliance on the information directly supplied by Killick who might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the names. 
      
       
     58 The Appellant submitted that the evidence was produced in breach of s69(3) of the Evidence Act which provides: 
      
       
        
        
         
         “(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the representation: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) was prepared or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, an Australian or overseas proceeding, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) was made in connection with an investigation relating or leading to a criminal proceeding. 
         
        
       
     59 The proceedings were those in relation to the armed robberies for which Killick had been remanded. The reference in s69(3) is to the making or obtaining of the representation contained in the record. It does not refer to the production of the record for the proceedings in which it is sought to be used as evidence. The record itself was created for the purposes of logging and charging inmates for the telephone calls made on their autodial cards. The representation was thus obtained for that purpose. In my opinion, it was not made in contemplation of any criminal proceedings nor in connection with any investigation, but rather for the administration of the Remand Centre telephone system. 
      
       
     60 The evidence adduced by the Crown formed part of a matrix of circumstances, including evidence that a mobile phone number to which calls were made was in the possession of the Appellant at about the time of the escape. The evidence was relevant and admissible for the purpose of establishing, with other evidence, that Killick made calls to the Appellant before the hijacking, including at 8.51am on the morning of the hijacking. 
      
       
     61 The second matter objected to was a photograph of a Luger pistol. The Crown noted that the trial judge in fact rejected the tender of the photograph. It was merely marked for identification. (See transcript 437-438) 
      
       
     62 The third matter objected to was the evidence of Mr Ayad who was a taxi driver who picked up a man and a woman in Bay Road, Waverton, and drove them to bushland near Mona Vale. He identified the woman in the journey as one whom he had collected on a previous occasion and taken from Strathfield to Bankstown Airport. The Crown said that Mr Ayad’s evidence was called even though it was inconsistent with other evidence for purposes of fairness and completeness. The evidence was given without objection and the Crown correctly submitted this aspect of it did not prejudice the applicant. As will be seen from other grounds of appeal, the element of inconsistency between Mr Ayad’s evidence and some aspects of the Crown case was such that counsel did not, for tactical reasons, object to the evidence even though its probative value for the Crown was slight. 
      
       
        
       Ground 6 
        
        
         
         “Her Honour misdirected the jury on the issue of the timing given by Mr Ayad regarding to the alleged rehearsal flight on 8 March 1999.” 
         
        
       
     63 Mr Ayad’s evidence placed the earlier journey to Bankstown Airport at about the same time as the rehearsal flight which, according to the Crown’s case, had been conducted by the Appellant some two or three weeks before 25 March. However, Mr Ayad agreed in cross-examination with a suggestion that the journey had occurred some two or three months before the 25 March journey. 
      
       
     64 In the course of the summing-up the trial judge summarised Mr Ayad’s evidence in chief. She said that he had picked up that same woman some two or three weeks prior to 25 March from Strathfield station and had taken her to Bankstown Airport. Counsel for the Appellant pointed out that her Honour had not referred to the concession in cross-examination about the incident being two to three months before the time. In her redirection to the jury her Honour set out the precise evidence that Mr Ayad had given in chief and also the precise question and answer in cross-examination. She recited in full that answer of “Yes” to the question that he thought the incident had happened two to three months before. 
      
       
     65 The Appellant submitted that this did not correct the original misdirection. This submission should be rejected. Her Honour directed the jury’s attention to the relevant evidence by quoting it in full. (See summing-up transcript 81) Her Honour correctly indicated at summing-up 81 and 86, that resolving the factual issue of whether the event occurred as stated in the evidence in chief or in accordance with the timing suggested in cross-examination, was a matter for the jury. This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 7 
        
        
         
         “Her Honour invited the jury to speculate on some important matters of evidence.” 
         
        
       
     66 Under this ground the Appellant referred to the evidence of Gerard Nicholson, some statements attributed to Killick and references to the second weapon.  
      
       
     67 Mr Nicholson was present at the office of the helicopter company when the female hijacker arrived to take the flight. He gave evidence about the appearance of the woman and the clothes she was wearing. A number of other witnesses had also given such evidence at the trial. Her Honour said in the summing-up (at p41): 
      
       
        
         
         “That is the only sighting that Mr Nicholson had of the woman whether that is the same woman that has been described by Mr Lawton, Mr Wieland and Mr Joyce is a matter for you ladies and gentlemen, but he does not see that woman going on to a helicopter and he does not see her with anything in her hands, so that is something for you to consider ladies and gentlemen, but the two other men, Mr Wieland and Mr Lawton, see the woman that they have described get on to the helicopter with Mr Joyce and fly away.” 
         
        
       
     68 The complaint is made that by the turn of phrase “whether that is the same woman that has been described” by the other witnesses, her Honour introduced a new element into the case. It was submitted that it had never been suggested by the Crown that anyone other than the female hijacker was at the premises. The turn of phrase used by her Honour is not such as to involve any element of speculation of a character which is material to the course of the trial. The thrust of the direction was simply to remind the jury that it was a matter for them to determine what evidence they accepted or rejected and what use they made of the evidence. The jury were told on more than one occasion that the facts were a matter for them. 
      
       
     69 Her Honour had also said in her summing-up (at p93) that the Crown:  
      
       
        
         
         “… then referred to the suggestion made by the accused in her evidence that Killick had said in effect ‘Don’t ask about the escape because the people involved were professional, there was a woman involved, albeit she might look a bit like you, she was still involved but don’t ask because she’s a professional person.” 
         
        
       
     70 The submission was that Killick had never said anything to the effect “she might look a bit like you”. It was submitted that this somehow invited the jury to speculate. The Crown accepted that the turn of phrase “she might look a bit like you” was not used by the Appellant in her evidence. The Crown submitted that this was a minor error of no significance in the context of the trial. The relevant passage of the evidence indicated that it was the Crown Prosecutor in cross-examination who suggested to the Appellant that Killick had said words to the effect that the woman who was involved in the escape was about the same height as the Appellant. The Appellant denied that he had said anything of that character rather that he had said “These people are professionals don’t ask them questions”. This was a minor error of no account in the circumstances of the trial. 
      
       
     71 The third matter raised under this head was the assertion that her Honour misdirected the jury on the issue of the second weapon produced by the female hijacker. One of the weapons found in cabin 14 of the caravan park, where Killick and the Appellant were arrested, was a Luger pistol. The Crown case was that the Luger was the same weapon used by the female hijacker. There was evidence that one of the weapons used by the hijacker was a pistol but there was various evidence about the second weapon. It would appear it was a larger weapon which needed to be assembled in some manner. The complaint is that on a number of occasions during the course of her Honour’s summing-up she refers to the existence of two “pistols” in the helicopter. There are such references at 20.6, 33.10-34.3 and 66.2-66.4 and 67.9. Reading the summing-up as a whole it is clear and, in my opinion, would have been clear to the jury, that her Honour’s various references to “guns”, “pistols” and “weapons” were not intended to be precise. 
      
       
     72 In the context of summarising to the jury the evidence of the helicopter pilot her Honour referred to the second weapon as “the other pistol” at 67.9 and went on to say (at 68): 
      
       
        
         
         “He said that the passenger then pulled out another larger weapon. He believed it was folded and clasped in two, but she very quickly assembled it and pointed it at him. He said that he was struck by how quickly she had done it. It obviously been well rehearsed and had come out in two pieces from one of the bags, in two pieces all folded and then clipped together very very quickly … He believed it was a much larger automatic weapon and he said that she reached into the bag and pulled out a large curved ammunition container and put that into place and kept on pointing at him and you will recall that she handed that gun over to Killick when he got into the helicopter.” 
         
        
       
     73 She went on to say that the helicopter pilot had “said it was definitely a rifle rather than a pistol” and gave a further description of the second weapon. 
      
       
     74 In this, and in other passages, her Honour summarises the evidence given about the nature of the weapon. It is correct that on some occasions she refers to “two pistols”. However, considering the evidence as a whole her Honour does leave the issue of the identification of the weapon to the jury in a manner which would not have confused the jury when making any pertinent findings about whether or not the second weapon used in the hijack was in fact the Luger pistol found in the cabin. The relevant evidence was properly summarised with an occasional reference which may have suggested some common identity between the two weapons, by reason of describing them both as “pistols”, but would not in the context of the summing-up as a whole have misled the jury in any material respect. 
      
       
     75 The Appellant submitted that the trial judge had impermissibly removed a matter from the jury when she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “But in any event on that 9 May, she was in possession of that particular gun in the way in which I have directed.” 
         
        
       
     76 In the previous sentence, her Honour had been concerned with what “the Crown says here”. The sentence objected to was a reference to the Crown case. The reference to what her Honour had “directed” was a reference to her earlier directions on the meaning of possession. 
      
       
     77 This ground should also be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 8 
        
        
         
         “The jury’s verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     78 In this regard the Appellant relied on variations in the evidence of the various witnesses describing the female hijacker. It is true that there were such variations. Indeed such variations are to be expected. In a case in which persons who have only a fleeting glimpse of an individual are required to recall many months later aspects of that person’s appearance, accent and dress, it would be the absence of variation that would arouse suspicion. The differences were not such as to suggest anything out of the ordinary. These were quintessentially jury issues which were properly left to the jury. The divergences were identified in the course of her Honour’s summing-up. None of the matters raised in this respect are of a character which would suggest that the jury was not entitled to conclude that the Appellant was the female hijacker. 
      
       
     79 The Appellant also relied on the evidence of Mr Ayad the taxi driver who suggested he picked up a male and female and drove them to Terry Hills at about 9.00am that morning. The Crown accepted that the helicopter flight hadn’t started until 9.39am. Again it is never the case that all witnesses are entirely consistent as to matters such as time. Nothing in the nature of the difference would suggest that the Appellant suffered any prejudice from the calling of this evidence. Whether or not the taxi driver was mistaken about the time of the journey was properly a matter for the jury. The Crown correctly felt obliged to call this evidence notwithstanding the inconsistency with the Crown case in this and other respects. 
      
       
     80 The Appellant also referred to a brochure which included a photograph of a helicopter that was found on a refrigerator at the home of Mrs Killick, the escapee’s estranged wife with whom the Appellant was staying at the time. The evidence was not irrelevant. Its prejudicial value was slight. It is not a matter that supports the particular ground of appeal, namely that the jury’s verdict cannot be supported. 
      
       
     81 The Appellant also referred to evidence of a mobile phone call on 25 March. This was a call made by Killick to his own mobile phone, which the Appellant admitted she had been in possession of. Her evidence that she had delivered it to a park and left it there could be and was rejected by the jury. The use to which the occurrence of the call was to be put by the jury was very much a matter for them. This matter does not support this ground. 
      
       
     82 The final matter referred to was a discussion about the nature of the second weapon produced by the female hijacker and whether or not it could have been the Luger pistol found in cabin 14 of the caravan park. There was evidence consistent with the proposition that the Luger pistol may not have been the second weapon produced by the hijacker. That evidence was properly left to the jury. There was a basis for inferring that the Luger was the weapon used by the hijacker albeit with a butt stock attached to it. That would have been the nature of the assembly that occurred and gave the helicopter pilot the appearance of a rifle. The evidence in this regard was properly left to the jury. 
      
       
     83 Considering each of the matters referred to above together, even accepting them at the full force for which the Appellant contended in her submissions, the cumulative effect is not such as to cast any doubt on the jury’s verdict or to suggest a miscarriage of justice. The evidence against the Appellant was very strong and her explanation of her own conduct in making arrangements for Killick’s escape, which she did not actually believe was going to occur, beggars belief. The particular matters to which she directed attention on this ground are trivial in comparison with the strength of the Crown case against her. 
      
       
        
       Ground 9 
        
        
         
         “Her Honour erred in her summing-up in that after graphically outlining the Crown’s circumstantial case she failed to adequately put the defence case which provided a rational hypothesis other than the accused’s guilt and would have entitled the jury that the presumption of innocence had not been displaced.” 
         
        
       
     84 The trial judge instructed the jury correctly both in respect to a circumstantial case and no complaint is made in that regard. Her Honour specifically directed the jury that it had to be satisfied that the finding of guilt was the only reasonable finding it could make and that there was no other reasonable explanation consistent with innocence. The Appellant relies on various matters, such as inconsistencies amongst the witnesses and her own assertions, and submits that there must have been a reasonable explanation. These matters were all properly left to the jury to assess. 
      
       
     85 The trial judge dealt with the Appellant’s case in relation to each of the circumstances upon which the Crown relied and outlined in some detail, the submissions of the Crown and of the Appellant’s counsel. In my opinion the trial judge put the Appellant’s case to the jury in a fair and balanced way. There were inconsistencies amongst the witnesses on issues relating to identification. Her Honour did indicate the nature of those inconsistencies in the course of the summing-up. The Appellant’s submissions in this respect consisted of no more than a recitation of the defence case on the various aspects of the circumstances on which the Crown relied. In the context of the submissions made by counsel on her behalf and by the trial judge in the summing-up, the case was properly left to the jury.

         “By refusing the application of Mr Stratton re no prima facie case in relation to Counts 4 and 5 her Honour was in error.” 
         
        
       
     86 Counts 4 and 5 related to possession of the weapons at the time of the arrest. Counsel for the Appellant had submitted that in the absence of evidence from Mr Killick it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had exclusive possession of the guns.  
      
       
     87 In this regard the Appellant relied in her submissions on the discrepancies with respect to the identity of the weapon between the evidence of the helicopter pilot and other evidence. This appears to me to be entirely irrelevant. The two counts of unauthorised possession of the pistol were said to have been committed on 9 May 1999. The issue of the identity of the guns found on that occasion with those used in the course of the hijackers was relevant for the purposes of the Crown case that the Appellant was the hijacker. This ground of appeal appears to me to be misconceived. 
      
       
        
       Ground 10.1 
        
        
         
         “The learned judge at trial failed to direct the jury as to the elements required to be established beyond reasonable doubt to constitute the offences of possession of a Derringer style pistol and a Luger pistol I was charged with. On the evidence no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant was in the possession of these pistols. Therefore the verdicts on Counts 4 and 5 are unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
       
     88 Pursuant to this ground the Appellant submitted that the judge failed to direct the jury as to the elements of the offence; that there was no evidence that she “knew about the pistols” and that she had not been asked and, finally, that Killick was not called to give evidence on the issue of weapon possession. 
      
       
     89 As one would expect the trial judge did direct the jury on the elements involved in all of the offences. She gave directions to the effect that the elements were that the Crown had to prove that the accused possessed the firearm and that she was not authorised to do so by licence or permit. No request was made for any further directions in this regard.  
      
       
     90 The other matters raised under this ground were briefly put. It was submitted that there was no evidence of knowledge of the existence of the pistols and that Killick was not called. As her Honour indicated it was not necessary to call Killick in this regard. He was plainly a witness that the Crown was entitled not to call. The whole of the evidence before the jury served as a proper basis for an inference that the Appellant knew of the existence of the pistols on the premises that she was occupying together with Killick at the time that the pistols were found. The evidence pointing to her as the hijacker, which the jury plainly accepted, reinforced the conclusion with respect to possession of the pistols, albeit more clearly in the case of Count 4 relating to the Derringer pistol, about which there was no issue as to identification. In my view this ground should be rejected.

         2 She did not mention whether the witness had previously known the person described; how good an opportunity the witness had to get a clear picture of the person described and what were the circumstances and nature of that description. 
         
        
        
         
         3 She did not draw attention of the jury to numerous discrepancies between evidence of witnesses who were a sign of unreliability of the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         4 She failed to give specific warnings about features of the evidence of some witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         5 She failed to point out the discrepancies between evidence of description and the appearance of the accused.” 
         
        
       
     91 In this regard the Appellant relied on both s116 and s165 of the Evidence Act 1995. The former refers to identification evidence and the latter refers to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, specifically, identification evidence in s165(1)(b). 
      
       
     92 Section 165 is only applicable if a request has been made. There is no suggestion that there was any such request in the present case. Section 116 relates to identification evidence, a term which is defined in the dictionary in terms of, relevantly, “an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was or resembles (visually or otherwise) a person …”. These submissions on the part of the Appellant proceed on the misconception that the evidence to which he refers was “identification evidence” in this sense.  
      
       
     93 None of the witnesses to whose evidence she refers in this respect purport to assert that the Appellant was the person. The various descriptions given of the female hijacker were tendered as circumstantial evidence. They were not identification evidence. The trial judge correctly left the entire body of evidence of these witnesses, in the various ways in which they described the female hijacker to the jury. The particular warnings and emphases said to be required in a summing-up, for the which the Appellant contended under this ground of appeal, were not required. Her Honour did draw the jury’s attention to aspects of the evidence, including the discrepancies between different versions, in a manner which was of assistance to the jury. She was not obliged to go further and warn the jury with respect to such evidence. 
      
       
        
       Ground 12 
        
        
         
         “Non-disclosure of the material which had been in the possession of the police at the time of my trial was prejudicial to the presentation of my defence at trial and amounted to an abuse of the process, therefore the miscarriage of justice occurred.” 
         
        
       
     94 In this respect the Appellant relied on an assertion that there had been a record of interview with another prisoner who was in the gaol at the time of Killick’s escape. The Crown informs the Court that there is no such record of interview. There is no evidence of it. This ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Ground 13 
        
        
         
         “Here Honour should have directed the jury to disregard Mr Ayad’s evidence after the total evidence was given, as being unreliable, irrelevant, inconsistent, misleading and, in parts, not possible.” 
         
        
       
     95 There were difficulties with Mr Ayad’s evidence. Some of them have been referred to under other grounds of appeal discussed above. They were not, however, such as to require a direction of the character for which the Appellant now contends. The Appellant was represented by experienced trial counsel. No such application was made. The Appellant requires leave to raise this issue. In my opinion leave should be rejected. Even if leave were granted I would reject this ground of appeal. The inconsistencies involved in Mr Ayad’s evidence could very well have been regarded by trial counsel as advantageous to the Appellant. 
      
       
        
       Ground 14 
        
        
         
         “In view of the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, a decision of the Prosecutor not to call Mr Killick as a witness gave rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice, therefore the verdicts on all five counts were unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
       
     96 Killick was a co-offender in all five offences with which the applicant was charged and convicted at trial. He had been charged and sentenced for the offences relating to the escape and to possession of the firearms on 21 December 2000. Killick had a lengthy criminal record and was serving a sentence at the time of his escape.  
      
       
     97 Obviously Killick could have given evidence about every pertinent matter in the trial. There will be circumstances in which the failure to call a witness will be found to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. (See eg Queen v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 363.) This is not such a case. 
      
       
     98 It would not be often that the Crown must call a co-offender, even one who had pleaded guilty and been sentenced for the offences. Killick was so obviously a biased and unreliable witness with respect to the involvement of the Appellant that there was no obligation on the Crown to call him. 
      
       
        
       Ground 15 
        
        
         
         “The verdicts on all five counts are unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
       
     99 The Appellant makes her submissions in this regard on a count by count basis. She repeats with respect to each count each of the relevant matters already considered above. Under the subheadings Grounds 1 to 14 I have rejected each of those grounds. Accordingly, neither taken alone, nor cumulatively, could they establish a basis for a conclusion that the jury’s verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory with respect to any counts. 
      
       
        
       Double Punishment 
        
       
     100 As I have noted above, in the context of Ground 3, the Appellant relied on what she referred to as “double jeopardy” with respect to Counts 1 and 2. She did this in the context of submitting on Count 1 that: 
      
       
        
         
         “The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory because of the evidence no reasonable jury could find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant rescued the prisoner by force because there is no evidence to support these allegations.” 
         
        
       
     101 She submitted that there were two limbs to this argument. The first I have already rejected, namely, that the force had to be applied towards an employee or property of the prison. However, what she described as the second limb was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “… if the charge Rescue prisoner by force is to stay then it brings double jeopardy because according to the evidence the only force which was applied during the actual escape was the force towards helicopter pilot and I already was charged with assault of the member of aircraft crew.” 
         
        
       
     102 She stated that the essential part of the offence under Count 1, namely the element of “force”, was the actual element of the other charge, namely assaulting the member of an aircraft crew. 
      
       
     103 This is an issue that has also arisen in the context of the submissions made by counsel who appeared for the Appellant on the sentence appeal. Counsel submitted that there was error when the sentencing judge imposed concurrent identical sentences on Counts 1 and 2, on the basis that the two offences contained common element. Relying on Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 esp at pars [42] and [43]-[49] Mr S G Odgers SC submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Approached as a matter of common sense … a single act was an element of both offences. The wholly concurrent and identical terms of imprisonment imposed indicate that the applicant was doubly punished for the one act and the sentences were accordingly flawed.” 
         
        
       
     104 The case was conducted, as I have noted above, on the basis that the element of “force” was the same as the conduct that constituted the “assault”. To repeat, in her summing-up to the jury the trial judge said, with respect to Count 1: 
      
       
        
         
         “The issue that must be decided by you is, was the accused the person who was in the helicopter holding a gun at the head of the pilot and forcing that pilot to land so that Mr Killick could climb aboard and be flown away.” 
         
        
       
     105 With respect to Count 2 the trial judge directed the jury on the meaning of an assault and said that it extended beyond striking or touching to a threat of striking or touching her Honour said at summing-up 19: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this case I can tell you ladies and gentlemen that the pointing of a pistol at a person would be, at law, regarded as an assault and that is what was alleged here that the person in the helicopter pointed a gun at the head of the pilot and if you found that a gun was pointed at the head of the pilot, that would amount in law to an assault.” 
         
        
       
     106 I have set out above the provisions of s32 of the Correctional Centres Act 1952. In s32, “force” is a mechanism by which the ultimate injury to the public interest is committed, i.e. the “rescue” of an inmate. In s206 of the Crimes Act the assault is an act committed which has a particular consequence, i.e. the interference with the functions or duties in connection with the safe operation of an aircraft.  
      
       
     107 The Crown submitted that by reason of the different effects the Appellant’s acts ought to be regarded as separate offences, despite their common element. In its submissions on sentence the Crown noted that, although there was a common element of using a firearm to threaten the pilot this occurred at different points of time. With respect to Count 2, the threat caused the pilot to deviate from his planned route and land the aircraft within Silverwater Gaol. With respect to Count 1 the threat caused the pilot to take off and fly the applicant and Killick out of the gaol. This is not the way the Crown case was put at trial as indicated in the passages of the summing-up I have set out above. It appears that the way the case was left to the jury was on the basis that the “force” of the Appellant for purposes of the s32 offence was applied prior to landing. It was not the Crown case that it was the Appellant who was holding a gun to the head of the pilot forcing him to take off. 
      
       
     108 In Pearce, supra, the High Court dealt both with the issue of double conviction and double punishment. That case involved two charges under s33 and s110 of the Crimes Act which, respectively, applied to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm and breaking and entering a dwelling house and, while therein, inflicting grievous bodily harm. As can be seen the gravamen of both these offences is the same, i.e. the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Accordingly in Pearce it was held that the single act founded both convictions. As Gleeson CJ put it in Environmental Protection Authority v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 502 at 509: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the conviction for conspiracy is not a legal bar to the conviction for the substantive offences; the gist or gravamen of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement.” 
         
        
       
     109 So here the gist or gravamen of the offence under s32 of the Correctional Centres Act is the rescue, whereas the gist or gravamen of the offence under s206 of the Crimes Act is the diversion of a pilot from his functions and duties, i.e. the hijack. That the element of force in one and the element of assault in the other was, apparently, said to be constituted by the same conduct, does not detract from the proposition that there were two quite distinct offences. In my opinion, there was no double conviction or double punishment. 
      
       
        
       Appeal on Sentence 
        
       
     110 The submissions on sentence raised three distinct issues: double punishment, parity and manifestly excessive sentence. 
      
       
     111 As noted above, counsel for the Appellant relied on Pearce on the issue of double punishment. Counsel referred to par [42] and referred to the single act, i.e. the infliction of grievous bodily harm as “an element of each of the offences under s33 and s110”. In Pearce, as in the present case, the trial judge sentenced the Appellant to identical terms of imprisonment on the two counts and made those sentences wholly concurrent. Their Honours said at [43]: 
      
       
        
         
         “We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act.” 
         
        
       
     112 The Court went on to consider the question of whether or not that matter was of concern by reason of the fact that the sentences were made wholly concurrent. The Court said that focusing only on the total effective sentence may “mask error” [45]. A sentencing judge is required to fix appropriate sentences for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as totality. Their Honours concluded at [49]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, we consider that the individual sentences imposed on counts 9 and 10 were flawed because they doubly punished the appellant for a single act, namely, the affliction of grievous bodily harm. Further, to make the sentences imposed on those two counts wholly concurrently may also be said to reveal error in that to do so failed to take account of the differences in the conduct which were the subject of punishment on each count.” 
         
        
       
     113 As I have indicated above, the gravamen of the two offences in this case was quite distinct. Although both offences carried maximum penalties of 14 years, in one case the focus was on a rescue by force and in the other case, on a hijack by threat. Even though the force and the threat was constituted by the same act, it cannot be concluded in this case, unlike Pearce, that the Appellant has been “doubly punished for a single act”. In Pearce, the single act was the infliction of grievous bodily harm. That was much more than simply an element of the offence, it was the gist or gravamen of the criminal behaviour. In the present case the gist or gravamen of the criminal behaviour was not the same in the two offences. In my opinion it is not correct to say that there was a double punishment on the facts of this case. 
      
       
     114 In any event it is not apparent to me that even if there was a double punishment that this could lead, subject to the Appellant’s other submissions, to a reconsideration which would result in any alteration to the sentence on either count. Nothing in her Honour’s remarks on sentence suggest that her Honour failed to assess the matters separately when determining the respective sentences for each of the offences. Her Honour made all of the sentences concurrent including those which occurred much later, i.e. the firearms offences. Considerations of totality were clearly of significance in this regard. There were two distinct, albeit interrelated, significant offences that stood out for their gravity, i.e. Counts 1 and 2. It was appropriate for her Honour to impose the longer sentences for those offences and, in view of their length, and considerations of totality, to make the sentences entirely concurrent. 
      
       
     115 Issues of parity arose in this case by reason of the fact that Killick was also sentenced for similar offences. This was a matter that her Honour considered. In the course of her remarks on sentence she noted that Killick was sentenced at the same time on the two counts of armed robbery and the count of discharging a firearm, which were the matters upon which he had been remanded in custody for sentence at the time of his escape. She noted that with respect to those matters the sentencing judge had imposed a head sentence of thirteen years with a non-parole period of seven years to date from 9 March 1999.  
      
       
     116 Her Honour then turned to the four charges for which Killick was sentenced that overlapped with the matters involving the Appellant that were before her Honour. The sentences imposed on Killick with respect to these charges were cumulative on the earlier charges. Her Honour noted that for the offence of escape from lawful custody his Honour imposed a head sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years; with respect to the hijacking charge, his Honour imposed a head sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of three and a half years cumulatively upon the escape charge; on the charge of detaining a person for advantage his Honour imposed a sentence of three years with a two year non-parole period, in her Honour’s words, “again to be cumulative upon the previous two charges”. Her Honour then noted that the sentence for the larceny of a motor vehicle charge was to be served concurrently. The two possession of firearms offences were not the subject of separate charges in Killick’s case but were taken into account on a Form 1. Her Honour then drew the following conclusion: 
      
       
        
         
         “Accordingly, in respect of the charges on the indictment which related to the offences which were committed with the Offender, his Honour imposed a total sentence of fifteen years with a non-parole period of eight years.” 
         
        
       
     117 All the sentences, except the sentence for larceny of a motor vehicle, were to be served cumulatively upon each other and cumulatively upon the sentence imposed on the armed robbery matters.  
      
       
     118 The Appellant notes that her Honour’s reference to “a total sentence of fifteen years” for the overlapping offences was in error. That is so. It is easy to see how the error occurred. Her Honour had referred to the respective sentences as being five years, seven years and three years and had added them up. It was submitted that the total effective sentence imposed was nine and a half years and her Honour was wrong in that respect. The error appears to have been that her Honour calculated the sentences cumulatively upon each head sentence, rather than each head sentence being cumulative upon the previous non-parole period. Her Honour was correct to compute the non-parole period as eight years. 
      
       
     119 Killick appealed (see R v Killick [2002] NSWCCA 1) with respect to all of the sentences, including for the earlier armed robbery. On appeal this Court restructured the sentences in such a way that, by reason of a different interconnection between the armed robbery offences and the four offences that are relevant for present purposes, the total head sentences for the current four sentences, it was submitted, became fourteen years, i.e. only one year less than her Honour had erroneously referred to in her remarks on sentence. 
      
       
     120 The relevant sentences were retained at the same length, as had originally been imposed but their dates were varied, albeit without effect on the relevant non-parole period. In the event the relevant comparison is between a head sentence of ten years with a non-parole period of seven years, in the case of the Appellant, and a head sentence of fourteen years with a non-parole period of eight years, in the case of Killick. 
      
       
     121 There are matters which make the assessment of parity considerations complex. The sentencing structure for Killick raised many considerations which make any direct comparison difficult. 
      
       
     122 For present purposes I find it pertinent to treat the sentences imposed on Killick for the charges of assault and escape together and make a comparison with the two concurrent long sentences imposed on the Appellant in the present case. If they had been the only two charges upon which Killick had been sentenced then, on the assumption that the assault charge commenced at the expiration of the non-parole period for the escape charge, Killick would have had a total sentence of eight years and six months with a non-parole period of six years. This is a pertinent comparison with the sentence imposed on the Appellant, namely a head sentence of ten years and non-parole period of seven years. Killick had a lower sentence, but only marginally so. If the equivalent charge for Count 3 is included then Killick, in whose case that sentence was cumulative, had an effective non-parole period of eight years, compared to the Appellant’s seven years. 
      
       
     123 Of particular significance for the sentencing of Killick was the principle of totality. That principle requires the Court to take into account not only the multiple offences which overlap between the case of Killick and the Appellant. The Court in Killick also had to take into account the principle of totality with respect to the sentences Killick was serving and the sentences for the armed robbery offences for which Killick was sentenced at the same time. The principle of totality would suggest that the sentences for the parallel offences imposed on Killick were lower than they otherwise would have been. 
      
       
     124 The Appellant acknowledged that as Killick had pleaded guilty this was a material consideration in the sentencing exercise in his case. Furthermore, with respect to Count 1 the Appellant conceded that the charge carried a maximum of fourteen years compared to ten years for the equivalent charge in the case of Killick. Nevertheless it was submitted that this did not justify the end result in which the head sentence was double that imposed on Killick. Similarly, with respect to the charges that did coincide. For Count 2, the head sentence was ten years compared to seven years and the non-parole period at seven years was double that imposed on Killick. In the case of Count 3, the head sentence imposed on the Appellant was a five year fixed term, compared to three years with a two years non-parole period imposed on Killick. 
      
       
     125 There were elements on parity for which the Appellant was entitled to favourable consideration. Her good character must be compared to Killick’s long record. Her prospects of rehabilitation were better. 
      
       
     126 The Appellant placed great reliance on what it submitted was the “inescapable” conclusion that Killick was the dominant figure in the criminal enterprise. Counsel submitted that the Appellant in this case was motivated by her love for Killick and that she committed the offences at a time of emotional vulnerability and under the influence of Killick who was described as “a persuasive and dangerous man”.  
      
       
     127 Her Honour made no findings of fact that the Appellant was as weak and submissive as the submissions on her behalf suggest. The planning involved in the escape may very well have been devised to a significant degree by Killick. However, its execution required a degree of care, attention to detail and boldness which does not suggest a weak woman hopelessly besotted by a domineering male. The two counts which carry the longest sentences both involved the threat of physical violence with a firearm. The level of criminality was of a high order. 
      
       
     128 Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the effective total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Her Honour did not regard the circumstances as constituting an offence in the worst category. The head sentence she imposed of ten years was significantly below the maximum sentence of fourteen years. However, it was a substantial sentence reflecting in the case of each of Counts 1 and 2 the level of violence implicit in the threat against the helicopter pilot. For the reasons her Honour gave, the offences were very serious. Her Honour was entitled to regard them as being in the higher range of seriousness. The sentences she imposed were, in my opinion, within the range of a reasonable exercise of discretion. This Court should not interfere. 
      
       
     129 The appeal should be dismissed.

       FACTS 
        
        
       Edward John Russell, now deceased, was the victim of unlawful racial discrimination and racial vilification perpetrated by a group of New South Wales police officers. A question of law was referred to the Supreme Court by the Appeal Panel of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. 
        
        
       HELD 
        
        
       Per Spigelman CJ, Davies AJA agreeing. 
        
        
       A  
       The Administrative Decisions Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine issues of vicarious liability under the  
       Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act, 
        1983. 
        
        
       Proceedings for unlawful discrimination pursuant to the  
       Anti-Discrimination Act 
        1977 are probably not a tort for purposes of the  
       Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal from a judgment of Sully J. His Honour answered certain questions of law referred to the Supreme Court by an Appeal Panel of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) pursuant to s118 of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997. Two questions of law answered by his Honour are no longer in issue. The question of law which remains in issue is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether the provisions of the  
         Anti-Discrimination Act 
          1977 extend to the Commissioner of Police or the New South Wales Police Service such as to make the Commissioner of Police or the New South Wales Police Service liable as ‘employer’ or ‘principal’ of constables acting in that capacity who are otherwise found in breach of the provisions of the  
         Anti-Discrimination Act 
          1977.” 
         
        
       
     2 Mr Ted Russell and Mrs Helen Russell are the parents of Edward John Russell, now deceased. Their son was alive at the time a complaint was lodged under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977. Upon his death his parents were entitled to continue the prosecution of the original complaint. The complaint was heard by the Equal Opportunity Division of the Tribunal in July and October 2000. The member conducting the inquiry upheld the complaint of unlawful discrimination and made certain orders. The Respondents appealed to an Appeal Panel of the Tribunal. The Panel referred the questions of law to this Court. 
      
       
     3 Sully J answered the question I have set out above: 
      
       
        
         
         “No; but the State of New South Wales is so liable.” 
         
        
       
     4 The Appellants contest his Honour’s answer. By way of cross-appeal the estate of Mr Edward Russell contests his Honour’s rejection of the proposition that the Commissioner of Police was liable. 
      
       
        
       Background Circumstances 
        
       
     5 The Equal Opportunity Division of the Tribunal held that six police constables, one sergeant and a detective, who are Respondents in this appeal, unlawfully discriminated against and unlawfully racially vilified Mr Edward Russell on the basis of his Aboriginality. The background facts found to exist by the Tribunal related to an incident in December 1993. The deceased was driving a stolen utility vehicle and was being pursued by a number of police vehicles. There was a collision between a police vehicle and the utility. Ultimately the deceased was arrested and taken into custody. In the process the passenger window of the utility which the deceased had been driving was broken. The deceased was hit on the arm with a police baton. He was dragged out of the utility. He was forced to the ground by four police officers. The deceased’s hands were handcuffed behind his back. He was carried or dragged up a steep embankment onto the road by his arms. Police officers deliberately trod on the deceased while he was on the ground. He was punched several times by at least one of the police officers. A number of the police officers bashed the deceased’s head against the back of the police vehicle. The deceased was subjected to abusive, foul and racist language.  
      
       
     6 The Tribunal found that there was excessive force and abusive language, and that that conduct was causally connected with the deceased’s Aboriginality. It was held to constitute unlawful discrimination on the grounds of race contrary to s7(1)(a) of the Anti-Discrimination Act. The Tribunal further found that the conduct constituted racial vilification contrary to s20C of that Act because it incited hatred towards, serious contempt for and severe ridicule of the deceased, on the grounds of his Aboriginality. 
      
       
     7 The Tribunal ordered that the New South Wales Police Service and the eight police officers pay, by way of compensation for the unlawful act, an amount of $30,000 to the estate of the deceased. The liability was to be joint and several. It was further ordered that an apology to the deceased and his parents be published in the local newspaper and that the Police Service and each police officer write a letter of apology to the parents of the deceased. The final order was that the Police Service cause a record of the Tribunal’s findings to be made on the employee management record of each of the relevant police officers. 
      
       
        
       Parties 
        
       
     8 Before the Tribunal both the Commissioner of Police and the New South Wales Police Service were parties as well as the individual police officers. These remained the parties before the Appeal Panel and in the proceedings before Sully J. By a Notice of Motion the Respondent sought an order that the State of New South Wales be added to the proceedings before Sully J. Sully J dismissed the Notice of Motion on the basis that there was a lack of utility in changing the parties before the Court in proceedings solely concerned with a referred question of law. His Honour said at [57]: 
      
       
        
         
         “If there is any need to reconstitute the proceedings before the Appeal Panel, then some proper application should be made to the Appeal Panel.” 
         
        
       
     9 The appeal to this Court identified the Appellant in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “Commissioner of Police/New South Wales Police Service/The State of New South Wales”. 
         
        
       
     10 The State of New South Wales has never been joined. The estate of Mr Russell in the cross-appeal states that his Honour erred in failing to consider whether the State of New South Wales should have been joined as a party.  
      
       
     11 It is common ground that, pursuant to the provisions of the Police Service Act 1990, the “New South Wales Police Service” has no legal personality. One of the orders sought by the cross-appellant was an order that the “New South Wales Police Service” should be identified as the State of New South Wales. 
      
       
     12 The Appellants, including the State of New South Wales, accept that it is the appropriate party. 
      
       
     13 The jurisdiction of this Court under s118 of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act is to “hear and determine” a question of law referred to it. That question, as set out above, refers to the Commissioner of Police and the New South Wales Police Service, but does not refer to the State of New South Wales. This appears to be a case of misnomer in the way in which the proceedings have been described. The terminology used was based on the incorrect assumption that the New South Wales Police Service was a body with legal personality and capable of being an “employer” for purposes of the Act. 
      
       
     14 In view of the conclusion to which I have come, it is not necessary to resolve this issue. 
      
       
        
       The Relevant Statutes 
        
       
     15 These proceedings involve the interrelationship of three separate statutes: The Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, the Police Service Act 1990 and the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983. 
      
       
     16 The Anti-Discrimination Act consists of a series of Parts which are concerned, respectively, with discrimination on the basis of a number of different characteristics: race, sex, transgender grounds, marital status, disability, responsibilities as a carer, homosexuality and age. Each Part of the Act comprises a number of Divisions identifying the spheres of conduct with respect to which discrimination is prohibited. In each Part there is a Division with respect to “Discrimination in work”. In most cases there is provision in a separate Division for discrimination in other areas, generally encompassing education, provision of goods and services, accommodation and registered clubs. In a number of Parts there is separate provision making vilification on the relevant ground unlawful. 
      
       
     17 Some sections of the Act create offences which, with the approval of the Attorney General, may lead to criminal proceedings. The remedial provisions relevant to the present case require a complaint which, after the performance of functions by the Anti-Discrimination Board, culminate in a hearing before the Equal Opportunity Division of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. 
      
       
     18 Section 7 of the Act provides, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “7(1) A person (the perpetrator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of race if, on the ground of the aggrieved person’s race or the race of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person, the perpetrator: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) treats the aggrieved person less favourably than in the same circumstances, or in circumstances which are not materially different, the perpetrator treats or would treat a person of a different race or who has such a relative or associate of a different race …” 
           
          
         
        
       
     19 Section 19 of the Act provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “19 It is unlawful for a person who provides (whether or not for payment) goods or services to discriminate against another person on the ground of race: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) by refusing to provide the person with those goods or services, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) in the terms on which the other person is provided with those goods or services.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     20 By s4(1) of the Act services includes: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “(e) services provided by a council or public authority”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     21 It was common ground before the Tribunal that the Police Service was a public authority. In some manner, not precisely articulated in the judgment of the Tribunal, the police were found to provide a relevant “service” to Mr Russell. The Tribunal noted that Mr Russell suffered injury during his apprehension and arrest and his property was damaged. It was, apparently on that basis, that the Tribunal concluded that “services” had been provided by the police and that they had been provided on terms which were discriminatory in the relevant sense. This is not a matter before this Court.  
      
       
     22 It is pertinent to note that in the course of reaching that decision the Tribunal relied on a statement of mission and functions and the definition of “police services” contained in s6 of the Police Service Act. In s6(3) of that Act, “police services” is defined inter alia to extend to: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “(b) the protection of persons from injury or death, and property from damage, whether arising from criminal acts or in any other way”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     23 The other contravention of the Anti-Discrimination Act which was before the Tribunal was based on s20C of that Act, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “20C(1) It is unlawful for a person, by a public act, to incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person or group of persons on the ground of the race of the person or members of the group.” 
         
        
       
     24 A critical section for these proceedings is s53 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “53(1) An act done by a person as the agent or employee of the person’s principal or employer which if done by the principal or employer would be a contravention of this Act is taken to have been done by the principal or employer also unless the principal or employer did not, either before or after the doing of the act, authorise the agent or employee, either expressly or by implication, to do the act. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) If both the principal or employer and the agent or employee who did the act are subject to any liability arising under this Act in respect of the doing of the act, they are jointly and severally subject to that liability. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Despite subsection (1), a principal or an employer is not liable under that section if the principal or employer took all reasonable steps to prevent the agent or employee from contravening the Act. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the principal or employer of a volunteer or unpaid trainee who contravenes Part 2A is the person or body on whose behalf the volunteer or unpaid trainee provides services.” 
         
        
       
     25 Section 123 was relied on and it provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “123(1) A contravention of this Act shall attract no sanction or consequence, whether criminal or civil, except to the extent expressly provided by this Act.” 
         
        
       
     26 Section 113 is important. 
      
       
        
         
         “113(1) After holding an inquiry, the Tribunal may: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) dismiss the complaint the subject of that inquiry, or 
           
          
         
        
       
     (b) find the complaint substantiated and do any one or more of the following: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) except in respect of a representative complaint or a matter referred to the Tribunal for inquiry as a complaint pursuant to section 95, order the respondent to pay the complainant damages not exceeding $40,000 by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered by reason of the respondent’s conduct, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
     (ii) make an order enjoining the respondent from continuing or repeating any conduct rendered unlawful by this Act or regulations, 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iii) except in respect of a representative complaint or a matter referred to the Tribunal for inquiry as a complaint pursuant to section 95, order the respondent to perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress any loss or damage suffered by the complainant, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iiia) in respect of a vilification complaint, order the respondent to publish an apology in respect of the matter the subject of the complaint or order the respondent to publish a retraction in respect of the matter (or order both) and, as part of the order, give directions concerning the time, form, extent and manner of publication of the apology or retraction (or both), 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iiib) in respect of a vilification complaint, order the respondent to develop and implement a program or policy aimed at eliminating unlawful discrimination, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (iv) make an order declaring void in whole or in part and either ab initio or from such other time as is specified in the order any contract or agreement made in contravention of this Act or the regulations, or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (v) decline to take any further action in the matter. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The power of the Tribunal to award damages to a complainant shall, in the case of a complaint lodged by a representative body, be taken to be a power to award damages to the person or persons on behalf of whom the complaint is lodged and not to include a power to award damages to the representative body. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) In making an order for damages under this section concerning a complaint lodged on behalf of a person or persons, the Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit as to the application of those damages for the benefit of the person or persons. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) If 2 or more vilification complaints are made in respect of the same public act of the respondent and those complaints are found to be substantiated, the Tribunal must not make an order or orders for damages under this section that would cause the respondent to pay more than $40,000 in the aggregate in respect of that public act.” 
         
        
       
     27 The power to award “damages” by way of compensation under s113(1)(b)(i) is a power to order such payment by “the respondent”. The word “respondent” is defined by s87 to mean: 
      
       
        
         
         “respondent, in relation to a complaint means the person or each of the persons against whom that complaint is lodged.” 
         
        
       
     28 Section 88(1) makes provision for lodging of complaints: 
      
       
        
         
         “88(1) … a complaint in writing in respect of any contravention of this Act or the regulations which is alleged to have been committed by a person … may be lodged with the President …” 
         
        
       
     29 By s96, the Tribunal is obliged to “hold an inquiry into each complaint … referred to it …”. 
      
       
     30 Recovery of amounts ordered to be paid is the subject of provision in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act: 
      
       
        
         
         “82(1) For the purposes of the recovery of any amount ordered to be paid by the Tribunal (including costs, but not including a civil or other penalty), the amount is to be certified by the Registrar. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A certificate given under this section must identify the person liable to pay the certified amount. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) A certificate of the Registrar that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is given under this section, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) is filed in the registry of a court having jurisdiction to give judgment for a debt of the same amount as the amount stated in the certificate, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         operates as such a judgment. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) A party to proceedings in respect of which an amount has been certified by the Registrar under this section may apply to the Tribunal for a review of the decision to certify that amount.” 
         
        
        
       and 
        
        
         
         “82A A civil or other penalty ordered to be paid by the Tribunal may be registered as a judgment debt in a court of competent jurisdiction and is enforceable accordingly.” 
         
        
       
     31 It was common ground that, notwithstanding the date of the conduct complained of, these proceedings are to be determined on the basis that s4B of the Anti-Discrimination Act applies. Section 4B was introduced by the Anti-Discrimination Amendment Act 1997. Section 4B was inserted by a 1997 amendment Act and it provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “4B(1) A reference in this Act to an employer: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) in relation to employment in a Department, is a reference to the relevant Department Head, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) in relation to employment in the Police Service, is a reference to the Commissioner of Police, and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) in relation to employment in the Education Teaching Service, is a reference to the Director-General of the Department of School Education. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) Anything determined or done with respect to any matter concerning any such employment by an officer or employee in any Department, in the Police Service or in the Education Teaching Service who is authorised to determine and do things in that respect is taken to have been determined or done by the Department Head, Commissioner of Police or Director-General of the Department of School Education, respectively. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Subsection (2) includes anything determined or done with respect to: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) any offer of employment, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the terms and conditions on which employment is offered, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the opportunity afforded for promotion, transfer, training or other benefits associated with employment, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) dismissal from employment.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     32 This section was introduced, in part, to overcome doubts that had been expressed about the application of the Act to statutory office holders in Director-General of Education v Breen (1982) 2 IR 93. In that case Hutley JA said, obiter, that only the “legal employer” could be guilty of discrimination (at 103). Hope JA found this proposition to have “considerable substance” and, in view of the authority of the Director-General of Education under the relevant statute, recommended legislative amendment (98-99). 
      
       
     33 The purpose of s4B is to ensure the application, in the circumstances of employment to which it refers, of the various duties imposed upon employers by the Act. As I have indicated above, each of the different Parts has a Division relating to discrimination in work, providing that it is “unlawful for an employer” to discriminate on the relevant ground in the respects identified in the respective sections. However, an employer may also become liable by reason of the application of s53. 
      
       
     34 There is no definition of employee. However, s4 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         employment  
         includes work under a contract for services.  
         
        
        
         
         employment agency 
          means a person who, for profit or not, provides services for the purpose of finding work or employment for others or for supplying employers with workers or employees.” 
         
        
       
     35 The Police Service Act establishes a body known as the “Police Service of New South Wales”. As indicated above this body is not a separate legal personality, but an unincorporated body said to be comprised of members. Section 5 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “5 The Police Service comprises the following members: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) The Commissioner; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) members of the Police Service Senior Executive Service. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) all other police officers and administrative officers employed under this Act; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) temporary employees”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     36 In s6 the mission and functions of the Police Service are set out. By s7 certain values of the members of the Police Service are outlined. Section 8 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “8(1) The Commissioner is, subject to the direction of the Minister, responsible for the management and control of the Police Service. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The responsibility of the Commissioner includes the effective, efficient and economical management of the functions and activities of the Police Service. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The Commissioner may classify the various duties that members of the Police Service are required to perform and allocate the duties to be carried out by each such member. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The Commissioner may issue (and from time to time amend or revoke) instructions to members of the Police Service with respect to the management and control of the Police Service. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) This section is subject to the other provisions of this Act and the regulations.” 
         
        
       
     37 Section 10 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “10(1) In addition to the position of Commissioner, the positions in the Police Service consist of such positions as the Commissioner may determine in accordance with this Act. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         (4) Police officers of the rank of constable (or such of those police officers as the Commissioner determines) are to be appointed to that rank or to a grade within that rank, and not to a separate position in the Police Service. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) Temporary employees … are members of, but do not hold positions, in the Police Service.” 
         
        
       
     38 Section 11 relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “11(1) The Commissioner is required to designate the positions in the Police Service which are to be held by police officers. 
         
        
       
     39 Section 12 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “12(1) The ranks of police officers within the Police Service are (in descending order) as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) Commissioner. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) Member of the Police Service Senior Executive Service. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) Superintendent (other than a member of the Police Service Senior Executive Service). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) Inspector. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) Sergeant. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) Constable.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     40 Part 4 of the Act concerns the appointment, term and removal of the Commissioner of Police. By s27 the employment of the Commissioner is to be governed by a contract of employment. 
      
       
     41 Part 5 of the Act makes provision for the Police Service Senior Executive Service. By s33, that service comprises persons holding the positions contained in the Schedule to the Act. Section 41 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “41(1) The employment of an executive officer shall be governed by a contract of employment between the officer and the Police Board. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A contract of employment may be made before or after the appointment of the executive officer concerned. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The executive officer is not appointed by, nor is an executive officer’s term of office fixed by, the contract of employment. 
         
        
        
         
         …” 
         
        
       
     42 Part 6 of the Act is concerned with non-executive officers of the Police Service. Division 2 is concerned with appointment of non-executive officers. Section 64 provides that such appointment is to be made, in the case of commissioned police officers, by the Police Board and in any other case, by the Commissioner. There is no reference in this Part to a requirement that employment be pursuant to a contract of employment. 
      
       
     43 Division 4 of Pt 6 is concerned with the appointment of constables and sergeants. Section 73 empowers the Commissioner to make appointments of persons to the rank of constable. Section 77 regulates appointments by the Commissioner of appropriate persons to the rank of sergeant.  
      
       
     44 Part 8 of the Act was referred to but only for its heading which was: “General provisions relating to employment of all members of the Police Service”. The sections in this Part make provision for members of the Police Service resigning to contest elections, requirements of citizenship, and certain other matters. They apply to all members of the Police Service. 
      
       
     45 The Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act, 1983 is described in its long title as: “An Act with respect to the vicarious liability of masters and of the Crown in respect of the commission of certain torts.  
      
       
     46 The relevant section is s8: 
      
       
        
         
         “8(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable in respect of the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is in the course of his service with the Crown or is an incident of his service (whether or not it was a term of his appointment to the service of the Crown that he perform the function) or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to or in respect of a tort committed by a person in the conduct of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity which is: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) carried on by him on his own account; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) carried on by any partnership, of which he is a member, on account of the partnership.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     47 It is pertinent to note s7 which provides, in parallel terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “7 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a master is vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by his servant in the performance or purported performance by the servant of an independent function where the performance or purported performance of the function: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is in the course of his service for his master or is an incident of his service (whether or not it was a term of his contract of service that he perform the function); or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of his master.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     48 Section 5 of the Act contains definitions including:  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
          ‘independent function 
         ’, in relation to a servant or a person in the service of the Crown, means a function conferred or imposed upon the servant or person, whether or not as the holder of an office, by the common law or statute independently of the will of his master or the Crown, as the case may require; 
         
        
        
         
         ‘

       The decision of Sully J 
        
       
     50 Sully J held that the Commissioner of Police was not the employer of the police officers for purposes of s53 of the Anti-Discrimination Act. His Honour’s conclusion was based on an analysis of the Police Service Act. His Honour was concerned to determine whether or not that Act had altered the common law position that police officers are not employees. The basic authorities in Australia for this proposition are Enever v the King (1906) 3 CLR 969 and Attorney General for New South Wales v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited (1954) 92 CLR 113. After careful consideration of the provisions of the Police Service Act, his Honour concluded that the Act did not disclose a legislative intention to abrogate the longstanding position of the common law with respect to the position of police officers. 
      
       
     51 The approach of Sully J on this issue is reflected in the paraphrase of s53 with which his Honour commenced this section of his reasons. His Honour proceeded on the basis that s53 could have incorporated within it the definition of “employer” in s4B, so that it read: 
      
       
        
         
         “An act done by a person as the employee of the Commissioner of Police which if done by the Commissioner of Police would be a contravention of this Act is taken to have been done by the Commissioner of Police also unless the Commissioner of Police did not, either before or after the doing of the act, authorise the employee, either expressly or by implication, to do the act.” 
         
        
       
     52 As can be seen, his Honour deleted the reference to “agent” and “principal” as irrelevant and substituted for the word “employer” the “Commissioner of Police”. This transliteration is based on the assumption that s4B has no implications for the concept of an “employee”. The word “employee” is not the subject of any definition. Subsequent to the judgment of Sully J, a similar issue was considered by this Court in Police Service of New South Wales v Honeysett [2001] NSWCA 452. 
      
       
     53 His Honour also considered s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act. His Honour held that proceedings under the Anti-Discrimination Act were an action in tort within the meaning of that section. His Honour referred to s6 of the Vicarious Liability Act, which deems a police officer, for purposes of vicarious liability, to be a person in the service of the Crown. In this respect, his Honour said, the traditional common law position had been altered. By reference to s5(1) the Crown Proceedings Act 1988, his Honour concluded that the right of action asserted against the Crown should be brought against the “State of New South Wales”. He accordingly answered the question set out in par [1] above; “No; but the State of New South Wales is liable”. 
      
       
     54 The issue that Sully J posed for his consideration was whether or not the proceedings before the Tribunal under the Anti-Discrimination Act were proceedings in “tort”, within s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act. Sully J referred to the obiter observations in this regard made by McHugh JA in Australian Postal Commission v Dao (1985) 3 NSWLR 565 at 604, where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I am of opinion that an action under the  
         Anti-Discrimination Act  
         1977 is an action in tort (see  
         Halsbury, 
          4th ed, vol 45 para 1201 at 558)…” 
         
        
       
     55 This opinion was adopted by Lee J in Allders International Pty Ltd v Anstee (1986) 5 NSWLR 47 at 65.  
      
       
     56 The relevant passage from the fourth edition of Halsbury upon which McHugh JA, Lee J and Sully J all relied is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Rights of action in tort. Those civil rights of action which are available for the recovery of unliquidated damages by persons who have sustained injury or loss from acts, statements or omissions of others in breach of duty or contravention of right imposed or conferred by law rather than by agreement are rights of action in tort. The proposition thus formulated shows that the nature of tort can, perhaps, best be approached by way of distinctions. The principal distinctions to be drawn are the distinction between an action in tort and an action in contract, and the distinction between a civil wrong and a crime, although the same circumstances may give rise to actions for breach of contract or in tort and although many tortious acts are also crimes.” [Footnotes omitted] 
         
        
       
     57 Sully J applied this definition and found that proceedings instituted by way of complaint under the Anti-Discrimination Act are proceedings which “[exhibit] the characteristics of a tort as defined, in particular, by the passage … cited from Halsbury”. 
      
       
     58 His Honour went on to say that the contravention of the Act by the individual police officers was done in the purported performance of a function in the course of service with the Crown. His Honour accordingly concluded that the Crown was liable for the conduct and that the State of New South Wales: 
      
       
        
         
         “… is liable to be proceeded against by a complainant who alleges that serving police officers have carried out their functions in a manner contravening the  
         Anti-Discrimination Act 
         .” 
         
        
        
       The Appeal 
        
       
     59 On the appeal Mr R Kenzie QC, who appeared with Mr J Pearce for the Appellants submitted that his Honour erred in holding that a contravention of the Anti-Discrimination Act was a tort for the purposes of the Vicarious Liability Act.  
      
       
     60 Mr J Basten QC who appeared with Mr S Beckett for the deceased, submitted that his Honour was correct in characterising contravention of the Anti-Discrimination Act as a tort. On the cross-appeal he submitted that, on the proper construction of the Act, the Commissioner of Police was also liable under s53. Mr Kenzie contested this submission. 
      
       
     61 Ms C Ronalds appeared for the police officers. She filed an outline of submissions. She adopted Mr Basten’s submissions on both the appeal and the cross-appeal. 
      
       
        
       Application of the  
       Vicarious Liability Act 
        
       
     62 The Appeal Panel of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal has a specific statutory jurisdiction. This Court’s jurisdiction is determined by the existence of a “question of law arising in the appeal” to an Appeal Panel, pursuant to s118(1) of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act. The parties in this Court proceeded, as apparently they had done before Sully J, on the basis that any issue of vicarious liability on the part of the State should be determined in these proceedings. However, this court cannot be given jurisdiction by consent. In my opinion, the contention that led his Honour to answer the question in the way he did, is not capable of arising before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal or, on appeal, before the Appeal Panel or, upon reference under s118, in the Supreme Court. 
      
       
     63 Section 113(1)(b)(i) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, as set out above, empowers a Tribunal to order a “respondent” to pay “damages … by way of compensation”. “Respondent” is defined in s87 to be a person or persons “against whom” a “complaint is lodged”. No complaint was lodged against the Crown or the State of New South Wales. The Crown or the State could, of course, be the subject of a complaint directly. In the present case the relevant allegation was of an indirect liability by reason either of vicarious liability under s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act or liability as an “employer” within s53 of the Anti-Discrimination Act. The latter is plainly a provision which would justify a party being joined as a respondent before the trial. The former in my opinion, is not. 
      
       
     64 In my opinion the Vicarious Liability Act has nothing to do with the relevant regime. If the State of New South Wales, or some manifestation of it, is merely joined as a respondent then an award may be made against it by the Tribunal pursuant to s113. However, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to inquire into, or to make any orders based on a finding of vicarious liability pursuant to the Vicarious Liability Act.  
      
       
     65 The following is the relevant statutory regime: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) Complaints may be made about alleged contraventions of the Act (s88(1)). 
          
          
         (ii) The person “against whom” a complaint is lodged is the “respondent” (s87). 
          
          
         (iii) An act by an agent or employee is, in certain circumstances, “taken to have been done by the principal or employer” (s53(1)). 
          
          
         (iv) Where s53 applies a “principal or employer” can be a respondent. 
          
          
         (v) The Tribunal is empowered to hold an inquiry “into each complaint” (s96). 
          
          
         (vi) A Tribunal may order the payment of “damages … by way of compensation” by a “respondent” (s113). 
          
          
         (vii) An amount ordered to be paid by a respondent may be registered as a judgment debt in a court of competent jurisdiction and enforceable accordingly (s82A of the  
         Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act). 
         
        
       
     66 Save insofar as s53 can be so described, there is not, in my opinion, any room in this scheme for the application of principles of vicarious liability, whether at common law or by statute. The obligations of a person, other than the person whose conduct is contrary to the Act or who is deemed to have committed the conduct of that person, may neither be the subject of an inquiry by the Tribunal nor be determined by the Tribunal. There may be issues of contractual obligation to meet certain payments. There may be issues of vicarious liability at common law. There may be issues of vicarious liability under a statute. Whilst the attention in this case is focused on s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act, that section performs the same function as s7 performs with respect to all other employers. The determination of issues of this character lies with the ordinary courts. Neither the Tribunal, nor an Appeal Panel on appeal from the Tribunal, has jurisdiction to inquire into such matters.  
      
       
     67 The Tribunal may make an order against a respondent only. Employers who become respondents by reason of s53 may have orders made against them. Section 53(2) has the effect that an employer and employee are jointly and severally liable. Vicarious liability makes the employer entirely liable, subject to rights of indemnity, if any. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to inquire into or determine such issues. 
      
       
     68 The Vicarious Liability Act issue does not arise on the question as posed by the Appeal Panel. It arises only because of the acceptance by Sully J of submissions made to him on behalf of the deceased. To answer the questions in the way his Honour did, in effect authorises the Tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction. It ought not be answered on this basis. Furthermore, the question is not a question capable of arising in the appeal to the Appeal Panel. It should not be answered. In my opinion the appeal should be allowed. 
      
       
     69 Although it is not necessary for purposes of the decision, I should indicate that I do not share the opinion expressed by McHugh JA, and adopted by Lee J and Sully J, that a complaint leading to an order of payment of “damages … by way of compensation” under s113(1)(b)(i) constitutes a “tort” within the meaning of s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act. 
      
       
     70 There is no doubt that statutes can create new torts and have done so. There is no simple definition of a tort. The elements that can be said to characterise torts are able to be stated at different levels of generality. The fact that all or most torts can be described in a particular way does not mean that everything that can be described in that way constitutes a tort. Even s52 and s82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) have been said not to create liability in tort for purposes of contribution under s5(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (Hampic Pty Ltd v Adams [1999] NSWCA 455 at [61]). 
      
       
     71 I note that the definition of tort in Halsbury, relied on in the prior authorities, refers to “civil rights of action” and “rights of action in tort”. In my opinion, it is not accurate to describe proceedings by way of complaint before a Tribunal as a “right of action”. That terminology is reserved for proceedings in a court of law. 
      
       
     72 A similar conclusion has been reached by Menhennitt J in Philip Morris Limited v Ainley & Incorporated Nominal Defendant [1975] VR 345. The issue was whether an action under the Workers Compensation Act 1958 (Vic), in which costs had been awarded, was an action in tort within the meaning of the relevant Rules of the Supreme Court. His Honour held that it was not. His Honour said at 349: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … an action of tort is one in which the remedy is a common law cause of action although the right being enforced in the action may be a right created by either the common law or statute.” 
         
        
       
     73 His Honour went on to characterise the right in that case in the following way (at 349): 
      
       
        
         
         “In essence, the action is one to enforce a statutory right by a statutory cause of action. This is made clear by the section itself. Whereas claims for damages for breach of statutory duties which create civil rights and liabilities are, without express provision, enforceable by common law actions, in the case of s62(1)(b) of the  
         Workers Compensation Act  
         it is provided expressly that ‘all questions as to the right to and amount of any such indemnity shall in default of agreement be settled by action or if the parties consent by the Board’. 
         
        
        
         
         This provision not only expressly provides for a statutory cause of action but, by implication, proceeds on the assumption that no common law cause of action would otherwise be available.” 
         
        
       
     74 His Honour’s reasoning was adopted and applied by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Esso Australia v Victorian Workcover Authority (2000) 1 VR 246. That case involved proceedings for an indemnity by an insurer who had paid compensation benefits under the Accident Compensation Act 1985 (Vic). One of the issues was the award of interest, specifically whether the proceedings were for the recovery of “debt or damages” within s60(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic). Winneke P referred to the statutory entitlement to indemnity from negligent third parties against compensation which had been paid. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[27] The person who is seeking to enforce his entitlement is not bringing proceedings to recover ‘debt or damages’. Rather he is enforcing a statutory right which is sui generis and which, if established, will have as one of its incidents a right to call for payments already made in partial satisfaction of those rights. … 
         
        
        
         
         [28] … the statutory right of indemnity conferred by the Act upon the person who has paid the compensation is not to be equated to the cause of action which the worker would, but for the Act, have had against the person liable to pay damages to him. This is notwithstanding the fact that it is an ingredient of the statutory right, sought to be enforced, that the person from whom the indemnity is sought was liable to pay damages to the worker. The claim to enforce the entitlement to indemnity is not a claim in tort. It is a cause of action created by statute for an indemnity against the person liable to pay damages to another. … Nor is the action to enforce the right of indemnity to be confused with, or characterised as, a right to recover a debt or damages from the person liable to indemnify.” 
         
        
       
     75 In my view such reasoning is applicable to the Vicarious Liability Act. The word “tort” in that Act is concerned with causes of action that can be enforced in courts. It may be the case that racial discrimination constitutes a tort at common law (see Constantine v Imperial Hotels [1944] KB 693). 
      
       
     76 Furthermore, in my opinion, the purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Act are not well served by permitting recovery from employers to whom s53 does not apply. Vicarious liability serves the tort law purpose of shifting the burden of a loss to a person who is a more efficient distributor of the loss. The purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Act are better served by focussing that burden on the actual perpetrator or perpetrators of the unlawful conduct. I do not believe that loss distribution is a purpose of the Anti-Discrimination Act. Denunciation, punishment and deterrence appear to be the primary considerations. These objectives are better served by joint and several liability under s53(2) than by shifting the entire burden of an award of damages to the employer, subject to such rights, if any, of indemnity that the employer may have. 
      
       
     77 The usual situation is one in which there is no doubt about a person’s status as an employee. In such a case, on the Respondent’s contention, both s53 of the Anti-Discrimination Act and s7 or s8 of the Vicarious Liability Act may apply. In the former case an employer is not liable under s53(1) if it did not authorise the act and under s53(3) can establish a defence that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee from contravening the Act. No such exclusion from liability is available under the Vicarious Liability Act. This factor highlights the widely differing purposes of the two Acts.  
      
       
     78 In my opinion, the balance between deterrence, denunciation and punishment on the one hand, and compensation on the other hand, is so widely disparate – s113 damages have been restricted to $40,000 since 1982 - that proceedings for unlawful discrimination should not be regarded as a “tort” for purposes of the Vicarious Liability Act. However, it is not necessary to finally determine this matter in these proceedings. 
      
       
        
       The Construction of s53 of the  
       Anti-Discrimination Act 
        
       
     79 Counsel for the Appellants supported the approach to construction of s53 adopted by Sully J. As I have indicated above, his Honour read the words “Commissioner of Police” in place of the word “employer” in s53. This left the word “employee” unaffected. In this Court, the Appellants supported his Honour’s assumption that the word “employee” in s53, and elsewhere in the Anti-Discrimination Act, is to be understood as a legal concept identifying a particular common law relationship. It is extended to encompass independent contractors, by the definition of “employment” to including “work under a contract for services”, but the statute did not, it was submitted, otherwise affect the common law concept. 
      
       
     80 As indicated above, there are a number of categories of members of the Police Service of New South Wales. Some of the categories are expressly stated to be employees. All members of the Senior Executive Service must enter into a contract of employment. The Police Service Act, notably, does not treat police officers as being subject to a contract of employment. It was this differentiation which, to a substantial degree, caused Sully J to conclude that the traditional common law position has not been altered by the Police Service Act. 
      
       
     81 The issue, however, is not one of construction of the Police Service Act directly. The issue is the meaning of the word “employee” in the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, particularly after its amendment in 1997 to include s4B. Whether a word such as “employee” is used in a technical legal sense depends on the construction of the specific statute in which it appears.  
      
       
     82 The word “employee” has a legal meaning in the sense of a person who has a contract of employment with another. However, the word is capable of being used in a more general sense to encompass a person who is paid for performing work on a regular basis at the request, and at the direction, of another. In particular statutes the word “employee” will often be construed to extend to an independent contractor, even in the absence of an express statutory extension of a character contained in the Anti-Discrimination Act. The issue turns on the proper construction of the word in its context, in which process the scope and purpose of the statute under consideration plays an important part. 
      
       
     83 Subsequent to the decision of Sully J, a similar issue arose in this Court in Police Service of New South Wales v Honeysett, supra. The Police Service paid workers compensation to a passenger of a car driven by a police officer. It brought an action against the officer for indemnification. Pursuant to s3 of the Employees Liability Act 1991 the police officer would have been liable to indemnify the Service if she was not an employee. That section commences with the words: “If an employee commits a tort for which his or her employer is also liable …”. 
      
       
     84 Priestley JA, with whom Ipp AJA and Sperling J agreed said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[22] The  
         Police Service Act 
          in my opinion shows a use of the idea of employment in its ordinary sense running in parallel with a recognition of the continuing office of constable as an office that can be exercised simultaneously with an employment relationship existing between the Police Service and the police officer. This seems to me to be a realistic recognition of the fact that the range of duties a police officer may be required to fulfil pursuant to the  
         Police Service Act 
          appears to be at least potentially and I would think almost certainly in practice, much wider than the range of duties required by the office of constable.” 
         
        
       
     85 His Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[30] The  
         Police Service Act 
          shows that in many ways the conditions of service of police officers had been substantially assimilated to those of ordinary employees; the  
         Workers Compensation Acts 
          have shown the same development as have various Acts regulating industrial relations. The fact that some of these Acts, preceding the  
         Police Service Act 
         , only apply to police officers by virtue of deeming provisions does not detract from the factual situation that has now been reached that in virtually every way police officers are treated statutorily as employees and, in the  
         Police Service Act 
         , in 1990, were treated as employees in an undefined sense. 
         
        
        
         
         [31] When those considerations are taken into account with the strong purpose behind the Employees Liability Acts of ensuring that persons in the position of employer should not be able to pass on to persons in the position of employees liabilities incurred by the employers as a result of things done by employees in the course of their employment, it seems to me that the word employee in s3 of the  
         Employees Liability Act 
          1991 should not only be read as including police officers working (to use a neutral term) for the Police Service pursuant to the  
         Police Service Act 
          but in fact means a class of persons including police officers working pursuant to that Act.” 
         
        
       
     86 A similar conclusion was reached by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Konrad v Victoria (1999) 91 FCR 95 where the issue is whether a member of the Victorian Police Force was an employee for the purposes of Div 3 Pt VI A of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth). The scope and purpose of the Act there under consideration led to the result that police officers were held to be employees for purposes of that legislation (see especially at [13]-[15], [59], [100] and [104]). The intent of the legislation was that it applied to “all workers” (at [14] and see [59] and [104]). 
      
       
     87 In the statute presently under consideration, the word “employee” appears in each of the provisions of the Act rendering it “unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee” on the relevant ground, in the present case, race. For beneficial legislation, such as the Anti-Discrimination Act, a liberal interpretation is appropriate. This is reinforced by the purposive approach required by s33 of the Interpretation Act 1987. (See IW v City of Perth (1997) 191 CLR 1 esp at 11-12, 18, 22-23, 58.) 
      
       
     88 Nothing in the scope and purpose of the Act suggests that it should be limited to persons subject to contracts of employment, even with the specific statutory extension to include work under a contract for services. Insofar as persons do “work” in a context closely analogous to “employment”, the purpose of the legislation would be better served by extending the protection of the Act to such a relationship. There must be some element of regularity and permanence in the relationship, and also an element of direction and control of work, for it to fall within an extended sense of the word “employment”. But where such context exists, the Court should be slow to hold that the Act has no application. 
      
       
     89 The construction for which the Appellants contend would result in the exclusion of all police officers from the benefits of the legislative scheme. Mr Kenzie QC accepted that the implication of the construction for which he contended was that the only members of the Police Service who could complain against discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, disability, homosexuality, age, etc. were those persons who were expressly made the subject of a provision in the Police Service Act that they have a contract of employment, e.g. members of the Senior Executive Service, or those who in fact had such contracts, e.g. administrative officers. Accordingly, on the submissions for the Appellants in this case, the only members of the Police Service who would not be covered by the protection of the Anti-Discrimination Act, in the sense that they could complain about discrimination against them in work, are police officers. This is a most unlikely result, particularly after the enactment, in 1997, of s4B. 
      
       
     90 Appointments to the Senior Executive Service and appointments to non-executive positions of commissioned police officers are made by the Governor on the recommendation of the Police Board. (See s36(1) and s64(1)(a) of the Police Service Act.) Appointment of constables, sergeants and administrative officers are made by the Police Commissioner. (See s64(1)(b).) It is the Commissioner who is denoted as the relevant “employer” by the 1997 amendments of the Anti-Discrimination Act. This is no doubt a reflection of the Commissioner’s authority over the whole of the Service, established by s8 of the Act, quoted above. It would be an extraordinary anomaly if, as the Appellants contend, the Commissioner was deemed to be the employer under s4B for the purposes of the Senior Executive Service, whom he does not appoint, but is not such an employer for purposes of the non-commissioned officers, whom he does appoint. 
      
       
     91 Counsel for the Appellants also accepted that it was a necessary consequence of the construction for which he contended that if a member of the Senior Executive Service committed a discriminatory act against a third party, the Commissioner of Police could be held liable under s53. However, no such consequence would flow in the case of police officers. This is another anomaly which is unlikely to have been intended. 
      
       
     92 There are a number of textual indications that the word “employee” should not be read in a narrow sense. The word appears most frequently in the context of references to “work”. Accordingly, the Division in each of the Parts which refer to discrimination in employment is headed “Discrimination in work”. The definition of employment is expressed to include “work under a contract for services”. Similarly the definition of employment agency refers, disjunctively, to the conduct of “supplying employers with workers or employees” in the context of “finding work or employment for others”.  
      
       
     93 Of particular significance for present purposes is the reference in s4B(2) to “such employment by an officer or employee”. Each of the paragraphs of s4B(1) relate to an employer “in relation to employment” in, respectively, any government Department, the Police Service and the Education Teaching Service. The reference to “employment” in the phrase “in relation to employment” in subs (1) was intended to encompass persons who were both “officers” and “employees”. This is a strong textual indicator that the word “employee”, where otherwise appearing in the Act, should not be given a narrow definition.  
      
       
     94 In my opinion the purpose served by the various sections in which the word “employee” appears, including s53, is such that the word “employee” should not be confined to situations in which there is a contract of employment, but extend to the situation of a police officer. 
      
       
     95 The question before the Court should be answered: 
      
       
        
         
         “Yes, with respect to the Commissioner of Police.” 
         
        
       
     96 The Respondents should pay the Appellants’ cost of the appeal. The First Cross-Respondent should pay the costs of the Cross-Appellant and of the Second to Ninth Cross-Respondents in the cross-appeal. In the appeal the Respondents should have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act, if entitled. 
      
       
     97 STEIN JA: I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with his Honour that the cross-appeal should be allowed and the question before the court answered ‘Yes with respect to the Commissioner of Police’. 
      
       
     98 Counsel for the cross-appellant, Mr Basten QC, accepted that if the cross-appeal succeeded, it would be unnecessary for the court to deal with the appeal. While I generally agree with what the Chief Justice has said on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983, I would prefer, in the circumstances that the cross-appeal should be upheld, not to determine the issue. 
      
       
     99 Spigelman CJ has made some obiter remarks on whether an order for payment of damages under s 113 of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 constitutes a tort. I would prefer to leave comment on this issue to another case on another day. 
      
       
     100 Accordingly, it is my opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed with costs. 
      
       
        
       
     101 DAVIES AJA: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES, JA: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Greg James, J. in draft. I respectfully adopt them as a statement of my reasons for concluding that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
     2 DUNFORD, J: I've had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgment of Greg James, J. I agree with the reasons given by his Honour for dismissing the appellant's appeal against his conviction. 
      
       
     3 GREG JAMES, J: The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him for an offence of robbery in company, an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The conviction was entered in consequence of the appellant being found guilty by a jury following his trial in the District Court of New South Wales at Campbelltown on 6 September 2001. 
      
       
     4 The appellant was sentenced on 26 September 2001 to imprisonment for three years to date from 28 August 2001. A non-parole period of 18 months was imposed. 
      
       
     5 The appeal came on for hearing on 28 June 2002. On that day, this court determined that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed, but the application for leave to appeal and the appeal against sentence should be allowed. Leave was granted; that appeal was upheld; the sentence of the trial judge was quashed and a new sentence passed: see Regina v. Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 267. 
      
       
     6 On that occasion, the formal order of the court disposing of the conviction appeal was made, but the reasons were reserved due to the commitments of various members of the court at that time. These are now the reasons which, in my view, required the making of the order dismissing the conviction appeal. 
      
       
     7 The short facts giving rise to the offence are set out in paragraphs five to eight of the judgment delivered on 28 June 2002. Taken from that judgment, they are as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The short facts of the offence, of which the applicant was convicted, were that he, in the company of two other Asian boys, at the Bankstown bus station in Bankstown Square at about 8.00 am robbed a 15 year old Year 10 high school student asking him for his money, his wallet and his pin number. 
         
        
        
         
         The three robbers approached a group of students and then just as the victim was about to join a bus queue, one of them asked for his money and wallet. The boys appeared to the victim to be aged about 16 or 17 years old, that is a couple of years older than he was. He identified the applicant as one of the three boys and the one that grabbed him by the blazer and told him, in Vietnamese, to sit down, pushed him back down into a seat and stepped on his left foot immobilising him. It was the applicant, he said, who demanded his money or wallet.  
         
        
        
         
         The applicant removed $20 from the wallet. The key card contained in the wallet was identified but the victim gave a false number when asked for the pin number. He was asked if he had money in his key card account and said there was just under $10. The card and wallet were thrown back to him and the boys left. 
         
        
        
         
         Subsequently he identified the applicant on another occasion some eight days later at Bankstown Plaza."" 
         
        
       
     8 The grounds of appeal as amended were:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. His Honour was in error in that he failed to withdraw the evidence of identification of the appellant from the jury's consideration. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour was in error in not properly warning the jury as to all of the evidence of identification of the appellant about which the jury should have exercised great caution. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour was in error when he directed the jury that the exculpatory statements by the appellant in his ERISP were not 'evidence in the same sense as the testimony of a witness given on oath. The accused's statements in the ERISP are not subjected to any test by way of cross-examination. You should regard those statements as one possible version of the facts giving them such weight as you think they should receive having regard to all of the evidence in the case'. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         4. The evidence identifying the appellant was so frail and dangerous that no jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty."" 
         
        
       
     9 An additional ground 3A was added. It is:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour was in error in failing to direct the jury that there may be many reasons why an accused does not give evidence."" 
         
        
       
     10 A summary of the evidence of the complainant of the circumstances of the robbery has been provided to the court in the Crown submissions. For the purpose of considering these grounds, it adequately and succinctly refers to the relevant matters. I set out the relevant portions of it below. 
      
       
        
         
         ""The robbery occurred at Bankstown Bus Station which is pat of Bankstown Square in Bankstown where there is quite a large Asian or Vietnamese community (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.14). 
         
        
        
         
         At about 8.00 am, Le approached Bankstown Bus Station and he saw a few students in front of him waiting for the bus. He saw three Asian boys talking to the students and watched the Asian boys walk off (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.1-2). 
         
        
        
         
         Le sat a few metres down from the other students and the Asian boys approached him. Just as Le was about to get up and join the queue because the bus had arrived, one of the three Asian boys asked for Le's money and wallet (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.2). 
         
        
        
         
         Le identified the first Asian, the appellant, as being 16 to 17 years old, 165 cm to 170 cm tall, shorter than Le (172 cm tall) and stocky with long black hair to his shoulders. He was wearing cream coloured pants and a pale green jumper (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.2-3, 23-34). Le said that the second person had his back to him but he described the second person as Asian, around 16 or 17 years old with short black hair, wearing creamy coloured trousers and a black jumper (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.3-4, 24-25). Le described the third Asian boy as being 16 or 17 years old, stocky and wearing a sports jacket, like a Nike tracksuit jacket (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.4, 25-26). 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant, the first Asian boy identified, grabbed Le by the blazer and told him in Vietnamese to sit down. The appellant pushed him back down into the seat and stepped on his left foot, immobilising him. He told Le to give him his money or wallet. Le took out his wallet, gave it to the appellant and the appellant searched through the wallet and removed $20 (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.2, 4-5). The appellant saw Le's key card and one of the other boys or the appellant asked Le for his PIN. Le gave him a false number. The third boy then asked in English if there was any money in the key card account and Le replied that he had just under $10. The appellant then threw the key card and wallet back at Le and walked off behind the bus shelter with the other two boys (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.5-6). 
         
        
        
         
         Le then joined the queue for the bus and got on the bus to go to school. While at school, he spoke to Year 11 student about what had happened. After school at 3.30 pm, he went to his mother's (Mrs. Nguyen) workplace and told her that he had been robbed at the station on his way to school (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.6-7, 14) and had been grabbed and pushed (Le, extract 4.9.01, t.8)."" 
         
        
        
       Grounds one, two and four 
        
       
     11 Grounds one, two and four overlap to a certain extent, being all concerned with the evidence of the identification of the accused by the complainant at Bankstown Mall some eight days after the robbery. It will be convenient to consider ground one first, recognising that the submissions on ground one incorporate much that was put in support of those other two grounds. 12 A summary of the evidence relating to that identification occasion is set out in the appellant's submissions and is as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""… 
         
        
        
         
         7. Eight (8) days later, on 7 June 2000, at dusk (about 6.00 pm), the victim was leaving a building at Bankstown where he had just attended a tutorial. He observed three young men at a telephone booth on the opposite side of the road about 20 metres from where he was standing. The victim gave conflicting evidence about what he then observed and thought. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'Well they were – when I first stepped out they were looking at me and then I started walking to my mum's workplace they started to go towards me – come towards me … so when I noticed they were starting to come near – towards me, and I recognised one of them, I felt scared because there was no-one around at that time and it was getting dark …' (t.116 examination in chief) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ""I was diagonally when I stepped out and I saw them, that was the first thing I saw near the phone booths were the three males and then I continued on and I glanced at them and then they came towards me so that I recognised one of them.' (t.28.1 cross-examination) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'Q. And is it the case that what drew your attention to one of the three was the long black hair, the long shoulder length hair, that is what you noticed particularly? A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And you didn't notice anything else about that person with the shoulder length hair near the phone booths or the telephones other than the fact that he was a person with that long black hair, you didn't notice anything else about him straight away, is that right or wrong? A. That's wrong. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What else did you notice about him on the first time? A. Well sir from the previous incident I recognised his face because he was the one who was doing all the talking. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. … Do you say that you saw his face straight away as soon as you stepped out of the tutorial? A. Yes.

           Q. From about 30 metres away on the other side of the road? A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Was he looking in your direction or away from you? A. He was looking at my direction. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And when you glanced after you (sic), you then stepped away and started walking down the street and you glanced again is that right? A. That's right. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. It was only a quick glance? A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           q. And had already concluded at that point had you that this person was the person who had robbed you on 30 May? A. Yes."" (t.29 cross-examination) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         8. The victim was frightened and he went into a newsagency and lost sight of the three males. While he was waiting in the newsagency one of the young men, wearing a black beanie walked by outside. He telephoned his father and his father understood him to say (in Vietnamese) that the boys who robbed him the previous week were following him. (t.291.1) The father noticed that his son's voice was trembling when he spoke to him on the phone (t.29.3) 
         
        
        
         
         9. The father drove to the newsagency and picked up the victim. There was no evidence from the victim that while he was waiting for his father, other than on the occasion when he saw a young man wearing a black beanie, he saw the three males. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The father drove his son to the Bankstown Plaza. The father then left the car to look for some police. While the father was absent, the victim's mother happened across the car and joined her son in it (evidence of the father t.30.4, which contrasted with the evidence of the mother who said at t.17.4-18.6 that she joined the car when her husband was driving it). 
         
        
        
         
         11. The mother gave evidence that when she got in the car her son told her that he was followed earlier by three boys one of whom had robbed him the week before (t.17.7). That evidence was in conflict with what she had told the police when she made her statement and the evidence she had given at the committal both of which were to the effect that her son had told her that the three males who had robbed him earlier were following him (t.22.9 and 25.1) 
         
        
        
         
         12. Some time after the husband had left the car, the victim told his mother that he saw the three males again (mother's evidence t.26.2 and victim's evidence t.12.3). The mother got out of the car to find her husband, she was apparently gone for some time because she went to the bus station and the train station (t.19.), failed to find her husband and on her return to the car, she saw the boys who had been earlier pointed out by her son talking to some men. She then saw her husband, she reported to him what she had learned from her son. The mother returned to the car, told her son that her husband was talking to two men (it is not clear whether the mother told her son that her husband was talking to two police officers, t.12.5 and t.19.5). The mother asked her son if the males talking to the two men were the boys who had followed him. The victim turned to look and said yes (t.19.9). The victim gave evidence that the closest he had got to the three males on the night of the arrest was about 10.-15 metres. At the time of the trial the victim was wearing glasses because he was short sighted. Objects about 20 metres distant appeared blurry. His eyes had deteriorated to the point that he needed glasses at the end of 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The father approached the police who were talking to three young men and reported what he understood his son to have told him, viz., that the three young men to whom the police were already speaking (and independently of his incident), had earlier robbed him. The three were arrested and taken back to the police station where two of them were released. One of the young men was released because he was Caucasian. A second young man wearing a black beanie was released when the police were told by the victim that the man in the black beanie was not one of the robbers. The third man was the appellant and he was charged. There was evidence that the police were told at the police station that the young man with long black hair was one of the men who robbed him. There was no evidence of the precise sequence of exclusion and identification at the police station. 
         
        
        
         
         14. The police officer who spoke to the victim at the police station, after the arrest of the three young men, recalled that he had been told by him that four (4) boys robbed him the previous week (t.5.6)  
         
        
        
         
         15. The appellant, who was 19 at the time of the incident, was interviewed by the police and in an ERISP he told them that it was possible that he could have been at the bus stop at 8.00 am on 30 May seeing his girlfriend before he went to TAFE but he didn't know. He denied that he was involved in the robbery or that he was following the victim on 7 June. He was offered a line-up but declined."" 
         
        
       
     13 Although the Crown does not accept a number of the criticisms explicitly and implicitly included in that summary, it provides a convenient basis for considering the appellant's submissions. 
      
       
     14 Ground one contends that the trial judge erred in failing to act in accordance with the procedure outlined by Chief Justice Gleeson in Regina v. R (1990) 18 NSWLR 74 at 76E-G (see Doney v. The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212 and The Queen v. Tugaga (1994) 74 A. Crim. R. 190) by withdrawing the evidence of the identification from the jury and directing a verdict of acquittal. It was contended that there were features of the evidence such that it should not have been admitted initially or, at least, that its dangers were such that it should have been ultimately withdrawn. In the argument on ground one, substantial reliance is placed on those features as being frailties of the evidence of identification posing dangers to proper appreciation of the evidence by the jury incurable by any directions and particularly by those directions which were given. 
      
       
     15 Ground two relates to the asserted inadequacy of the directions which were given on this evidence and particularly to those features of the evidence, referred to as ""frailties"", it is asserted affected the identification which were also referred to in the argument on ground one. Ground four refers to those same frailties as so undermining the value of the evidence as to render the verdict unsupported by it. 
      
       
        
       Ground One 
        
       
     16 It was contended in support of ground one that, although the evidence of the identification was admissible, the application of s.137 of the Evidence Act 1995 required the rejection of it. It was submitted that when regard was had to the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995, notably s.137 and s.165, and to those aspects of the identification evidence, which it was submitted were required to be taken into consideration in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Domican v. The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555, it became incumbent on the trial judge to reject or withdraw the evidence. It was submitted that the trial judge erred in refusing the application that this evidence be withdrawn and did so because he failed to afford sufficient weight to what was asserted to be prejudicial aspects of the evidence. It was submitted he erred in considering that any prejudice was limited to the accused ""being deprived of the opportunity of testing any initial description given by [the victim] to the police at the station against the observation which he [the victim] made on the night [of 7 June]"". It was contended that he erred when considering whether such prejudice as there might have been was unfair by limiting his consideration of that matter to whether there was found to be positive conduct on the part of the prosecution contributing to or causing that prejudice. 
      
       
     17 It was submitted that the identification evidence was such when analysed and when regard was had to the various matters said to effect its reliability, as to have almost no probative force and a great deal of prejudicial impact, only one, albeit, an important aspect of which, was the denial of the opportunity to which I have already referred. 
      
       
     18 The danger of unfair prejudice, it was correctly submitted, is to be identified from the risk that the jury might misuse the evidence or attach to it a probative weight disproportionate to its probative value, notwithstanding such appropriate directions as the trial judge might give. It thus becomes necessary in considering whether the trial judge erred to have regard to the matters which it is submitted would undermine the complainant's positive identification and to have regard to the appropriateness of the directions to the jury. As I have already noted these are the matters to which grounds two and four respectively relate. 
      
       
     19 It was contended that the requirements of s.137 of the Evidence Act 1995, as elucidated by the decision of this court in Regina v. Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61, were that in the event of a trial judge finding there was a danger of unfair prejudice, it was not for the judge to exercise any discretion, as the judge was required to exclude the evidence unless finding that its probative value outweighed that danger. It was further submitted it was not open to the trial judge here to make that latter finding.  
      
       
     20 In his judgment, his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The first question is whether the evidence should be rejected under s.137. If it is to be rejected under that section it would be because the accused has been deprived of the opportunity of testing any initial description given by Joseph Le to the police at the station on 3 May against the observation which he made on the night in question. 
         
        
        
         
         I am not satisfied that there is unfair prejudice to the accused arising out of a deficiency in police records which is not due to any positive act on the part of the prosecution. The probative value of the identification evidence is substantial and although no positive prejudice was identified, I have taken into account the prejudice that does arise because of the inability to test Joseph Le's evidence against his initial description, but find that that does not outweigh the probative value of the evidence and I do not intend to reject it on that ground."" 
         
        
       
     21 Section 137 provides:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 
         
        
       
     22 In Blick (supra), at paras.13 and 19-20, it was held by Sheller, JA., with whom James and Dowd, JJ. agreed:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""13. The comment has been made (see for example Ritchie's Supreme Court Practice, para.4235.2) that at common law, a trial judge in criminal proceedings had a discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice that could follow from its admission. In contrast, s.137 made it mandatory to exclude such evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         19. When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s.137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion: see the cases referred to by Priestley, JA. in  
         Morgan v. McMahon 
          (1985) 3 NSWLR 700 at 716 and following, particularly  
         Lee Transport Co. Limited v. Watson  
         (1940) 64 CLR 1 at 13 and  
         Miller v. Jennings 
          (1954) 92 CLR 190at 197. In the second of those cases, Dixon, CJ. and Kitto, J., in an appeal against damages awarded by the trial judge, said of the sum awarded that it was 'reached after a very full and careful examination of the facts of the case and it represents an informed judgment upon a matter which must largely be one of opinion and must be governed to a not inconsiderable degree by an estimate formed of the witnesses and in particular the appellant'. Translated to the task set by s.137, a trial judge's estimate of how the probative value should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice will be one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge's own trial experience. In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment: see Heydon, 'A Guide to the Evidence Acts', 2nd ed., para.3.725. 
         
        
        
         
         20. Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected."" 
         
        
       
     23 It was contended on appeal that the reliability of the evidence was adversely affected by the following matters:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""(a) the opportunity for the identification of the offenders at the time of the robbery on 30 May was extremely limited; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the offenders were complete strangers to the victim; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the victim's state of mind at the time of the offence was such that his observations may have been unreliable; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) the victim was a youth; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) the victim's eyesight was probably defective; 
         
        
        
         
         (f) there was no evidence of any contemporaneous description of the offenders given by the victim to anyone; 
         
        
        
         
         (g) there was no evidence of any descriptions of the offenders by any of the other persons present at the scene; 
         
        
        
         
         (h) the only descriptions given by the victim (at any time) of the offenders were of the most general kind and they were quite incapable of supporting an inference that the appellant was one of the offenders; 
         
        
        
         
         (i) those descriptions were given many days later and after he had seen the appellant; 
         
        
        
         
         (j) there was no physical or other evidence which supported the identification; 
         
        
        
         
         (k) the victim told the jury that there were three offenders but he initially told the police that there were four; 
         
        
        
         
         (l) the identification of the appellant was made eight days after the offence on 7 June; 
         
        
        
         
         (m) the identification of the appellant on 7 June was first made by the victim from a distance of about 20 metres in less than perfect lighting conditions at dusk from across the street; 
         
        
        
         
         (n) the evidence of the circumstances of that identification was equivocal as to precisely when it was made. 
         
        
        
         
         (o) whenever that identification was made it was made when the state of mind of the victim was one of fear; 
         
        
        
         
         (p) the evidence was that the victim told his father and may have told his mother that when he first identified the offender on 7 June, the offender was in a group of three males all of whom were involved in the robbery; 
         
        
        
         
         (q) that identification of the group as being responsible was apparently wrong as one of the group was Caucasian and the victim asserted that the offenders were all Asian; 
         
        
        
         
         (s) sic the identification was in part concluded by a process of eliminating two of the group of three; 
         
        
        
         
         (t) the evidence suggests that confirmation of the identification was made when the victim saw the appellant being spoken to by police officers; 
         
        
        
         
         (u) the identification was confirmed by his mother asking him to confirm that the appellant was the offender. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) from the time of the first identification outside the tutorial to the confirmation when the appellant was being spoken to by the police the victim had lost sight of the appellant and the group he was with on at least two occasions for some time; 
         
        
        
         
         (w) the closest the victim was to the appellant during the dusk of 7 June when he identified him was about 10 – 15 metres; 
         
        
        
         
         (x) the victim estimated the age of the offender as 16 or 17, whereas the appellant was aged 19."" 
         
        
       
     24 It was for those reasons submitted the probative value was low and the prejudice so high it was incurable by the directions. Those considerations were advanced on this appeal. At trial, the following matters (which to my mind were not, in their totality, substantially different to the totality of those now referred to) were put forward as matters relevant to an appropriate direction under s.165 of the Evidence Act 1995:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""(a) the accused was a stranger; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the identification was made at dusk seven days later at a distance of 20 to 30 metres initially; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the observation was for a short period of time, measured in seconds, followed by a momentary glance; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) only one witness is available to give evidence of identity; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) the opportunity to observe the perpetrator on the date of the robbery was short in time, although the observation took place at short range; 
         
        
        
         
         (f) the identification was not corroborated or able to be measured against an initial description; 
         
        
        
         
         (g) Joseph Le may have been mistaken because initially he thought the three men outside the phone box in the vicinity of the place where he had left his tutorial on 7 June were the three men who robbed him; and 
         
        
        
         
         (h) his assertion there were three men or boys involved in the robbery is contradicted by the evidence of Senior Constable Bird, who later recalls four being mentioned as the number involved. 
         
        
        
         
         It is conceded that the requirements of s.114 of the Evidence Act 1995 are complied with and that the visual identification evidence is not excluded by that section because in the ERISP the accused declined to participate in the line-up and the provisions of s.114(2)(c) are met."" 
         
        
       
     25 These matters referred to at trial and those referred to here were what were said at trial and here respectively to amount to frailties in the identification evidence. 
      
       
     26 The trial judge set out his reasons for the refusal in the judgment of 5 September 2001 in which he referred to the appropriate test as enunciated by Hunt, CJ. at CL. in Tugaga (supra at 196). In that judgment, at least, the trial judge identified and considered the general effect of the asserted frailties of the evidence. 
      
       
     27 His Honour did not accept that the lack of the opportunity to test the description or any deficiency of police records amounted to unfair prejudice or that the inability to test, so far as it occasioned prejudice, occasioned such prejudice as outweighed the high probative value of the evidence. That latter process undertaken by his Honour was predicated on his Honour's earlier concluding that he was not satisfied there was unfair prejudice. As will appear, his Honour was of the view that the asserted frailties could be dealt with by appropriate directions and gave directions in the summing up to that end. Thus, his Honour concluded that the evidence should be left to the jury. 
      
       
     28 Although his Honour did not express his approach to the application of s.137 to the prejudice he detected in accordance with the requirements of the section (see Blick (supra)), his Honour's, refusing to reject the evidence on the basis of his finding that the prejudice he detected did not outweigh the probative value, does not display any material error, since his Honour did not find any unfair prejudice and it is with unfair prejudice that s.137 is concerned. I therefore do not consider he fell into any error of substance. Indeed, having regard to the asserted frailties, for myself, I would not conclude that it was incumbent on his Honour to find any unfair prejudice nor would I conclude that any prejudice there might have been would not be outweighed by the probative value of the evidence, particularly having regard to the directions which were given on this topic to the jury. 
      
       
     29 On the question of appropriate directions, his Honour, in the judgment said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The next question is whether the frailty or frailties are such as they cannot be cured by appropriate caution to the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         There are uncertainties surrounding Joseph Le's identification of the accused. He made a positive assertion to his father that the three boys who robbed him were in the plaza. That is inconsistent with the fact that two of the boys in the plaza were not boys who robbed him on 30 May because one was Caucasian and the other was excluded by Joseph Le during the course of the investigations at the police station. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused was not identified as a result of that elimination. He had already been identified by Joseph Le as the person who robbed him at the bus station. 
         
        
        
         
         There was an issue as to whether Joseph Le told his mother when she came to the motor car after his father had picked him up from a newsagency that the three boys who robbed him were in the plaza or one of the three boys who robbed him was in the plaza. Ultimately that would be a matter for the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         I have come to the conclusion that the evidence of identification made seven days after the events took place in the circumstances which I have outlined should not be withdrawn from the jury. The frailties are such that they can be covered by a direction in accordance with the authorities since  
         Regina v. Domican 
          and in accordance with s.116 and s.165 of the Evidence Act 1995."" 
         
        
       
     30 His Honour gave the jury the following general directions:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The next matter in which I will give you a direction of law concerns identification evidence. And it is, in the context of this case ladies and gentlemen, a very important direction of law. Evidence that the accused has been identified by a witness as doing something must, whenever it is disputed by the accused, as it is in this case, be approached by you with special caution before you accept it as reliable. That caution is necessary even though you may be satisfied that the witness has been giving completely honest evidence when saying that he or she identified the accused. That is even if you are satisfied that Joseph Le has been giving completely honest evidence when saying that he identified the accused. These particular directions relate to the reliability of the identification evidence given, not to the honesty with which it was given. Special caution is necessary before accepting identification evidence because of the possibility that even completely honest witnesses may have been mistaken in their identification. I am not suggesting that the evidence of such a witness must be regarded as unreliable. My task is no more than to draw your attention to the possibility that the evidence of such a witness may be unreliable and to explain why that is so, so as to enable you to exercise the special caution which is required in determining whether to accept that evidence as reliable and what weight is to be given to it. The common experience of the criminal courts over the years, both here in Australia and overseas, has demonstrated that identification evidence, however honestly given, may turn out to be unreliable. There have been some notorious cases over the yeas in which completely honest evidence of identification has been demonstrated to be wrong after innocent people have been convicted. The reliability of an identification of a person depends upon the circumstances in which the witness observed the person whom he or she has identified as the accused and any one of those circumstances may possibly lead to error. For example, how long was the period of observation? In what light was it made and from what distance was it made? Was there anything about the person observed which would have impressed itself upon the witness? Was there any special reason for remembering the person observed? How long afterwards was the witness asked about the person seen? How did the description given then, compare with the appearance of the accused? Each of those matters must be considered in every identification case and I will shortly be drawing your attention to some particular matters raised in this present case. It is perhaps easier to understand the possibility of error when evidence is given by someone who has not previously known the accused, but errors may also occur when the witness has previously known the accused. Mistakes have been known to be made by friends and even by relatives of a person who thought that it was their friend or relative whom they had seen. Because the witness who gives evidence of identification, that is Joseph Le in this case, honestly believes, you remember he said he was 100% certain, that his or her evidence is correct, that evidence will usually be quite impressive, even persuasive. The issue at this stage, however, is not whether the evidence is honest, the issue is whether the evidence is reliable. This warning of the need for special caution before accepting the evidence of identification is one which is given in every case in which such evidence is disputed by the accused. It is not given because of any particular view which I may have formed concerning the reliability of the identification evidence in the present case, the weight to be given to that evidence is a matter for your decision, not mine and I have nothing to do with that decision which you have to make. You should not interpret these directions as indicating any particular view which I may have formed, one way or the other. As I have said, you must approach all identification evidence with special caution. There are, however, a number of matters in this case to which I propose now to draw your attention, which are relevant to the reliability of the evidence of identification that has been given in this case, and my direction is that you are bound to consider those matters in determining whether you will accept that evidence as reliable. I do not say that you must regard all or any of them as necessarily undermining the reliability of the identification evidence and I repeat, that I do not express any opinion myself as to whether they should lead you to reject that evidence as unreliable. My purpose in referring to these matters is only to assist you in your task by pointing them out as warranting your attention and by directing you that you are bound to give them careful consideration.""  
         
        
       
     31 He then particularly directed the jury on a number of matters including the absence of a recorded description on the night of the offence; the effects of the lapse of time on the reliability of the description given eight days later; the paucity of the description then given; the fact it was given after the identification occasion, the circumstances of that robbery and the identification occasion eight days later; the apparent mistake concerning the identity of at least one of the three boys seen at the Bankstown Mall as being one of the robbers. His Honour then said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Ladies and gentlemen, the directions I have given you on the identification evidence have contained matters which I have brought to your attention which you are bound to consider in deciding whether you will accept the identification evidence in this case as reliable. I remind you again of the warning I gave you of the need for special caution before accepting the evidence of identification and that evidence that the accused has been identified by a witness as doing something must, whenever it is disputed by the accused, be approached by you with special caution before you accept it as reliable.""  
         
        
       
     32 When directing the jury on the onus and standard of proof, his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""You heard me refer to, in my opening remarks and you have heard both counsel refer you to, the onus or standard of proof which the Crown bears in criminal proceedings such as this. This is a criminal trial and although it has taken a short period of time, it is of a most serious nature and the burden of proof of the guilt of the accused is placed firmly upon the Crown. That onus remains upon the Crown in relation to every issue in this case. This does not mean that the Crown has to prove the truth of each assertion of each crown witness, what the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is each ingredient in the charge. I will come to those ingredients in the charge a little later ladies and gentlemen and I will have distributed to you, some written material which will contain an outline and a definition of those elements or ingredients of the charge. There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for the accused to establish his innocence but for the Crown to prove his guilty and prove it beyond reasonable doubt. The crown must satisfy you of that guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is a fundamentally important part of our system of justice that people tried in these courts are presumed to be innocent of the crime or crimes alleged against them until a jury of their fellow citizens has been satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt, that they are guilty of those crimes. The accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in your mind. It is vitally important that you clearly understand that the accused must be acquitted if his guilt has not been proved to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. You do not have to be satisfied that the accused is innocent before you should acquit him. If you are unable to decide where the truth lies, even though you feel he may be guilty, if you have a reasonable doubt about it you must find him not guilty. I should warn you that suspicion is not a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion must play no part in your function as judges of the facts, not even the gravest suspicion will suffice as proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        
        
         
         You heard Mr. Marshall say, when he opened the crown case, and you heard him say again in his closing address to you and you also heard Mr. Hancock say that this is a case that there is one witness who is essential to the proof of the Crown case and that witness is Joseph Le. You should therefore examine and scrutinise his evidence with great care before you decide that a verdict of guilty should be brought in, if at all. And you should only find the accused guilty if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of Joseph Le. Now the fact that I have given you that warning does not mean that I have formed any view as to the honesty or reliability of Joseph Le as a witness. It is a warning that would be given in any case where the Crown case depended on the evidence of one witness."" 
         
        
       
     33 Neither, when considered on this ground nor when considered on ground two, do I see the submission that the further matters that it was submitted should have been put on appeal were necessary. Indeed, I regard his Honour's direction as both legally appropriate and factually compendious 
      
       
     34 Having regard to all of the matters considered by his Honour, and the matters covered by the directions, I see no error in his Honour failing to withdraw the evidence from the jury's consideration. The evidence was highly probative and, as will be seen, the direction were entirely adequate. Ground one must be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground Two 
        
       
     35 The argument in support of this ground contends in reliance on the judgments in Domican (supra) that notwithstanding how the defence case was conducted, his Honour was required to direct the jury on further specific matters and that the judge should have done so of his own motion. It is not necessary to canvass each individual matter that it was contended should have been referred to in this judgment as each such matter was the subject of a direction, was included in a more general matter the subject of a direction, was so obvious as not to require a direction or was appropriately rejected by his Honour as not factually arising. 
      
       
     36 It is apparent that his Honour was aware of and directed the jury in relation to all matters of substance which needed to be considered on the reliability and dangers of the identification evidence. 
      
       
     37 No application was made for any redirections nor was there any suggestion at trial of any inadequacy in his Honour's drawing the relevant matters of fact to the jury's attention. I turn to the effect of those matters on the submissions put forward on appeal. 
      
       
     38 The significance of the absence of an application for a further direction has recently been referred to in this court in Regina v. Mitton [2002] NSWCCA 124 at paragraphs 41-44 and 48-50. Those passages deal with the submission in that case of error arising from an omission to give what was asserted to be an essential direction on law relating to an element founding the appellant's liability however they are apposite to the present case and are of such importance they bear repetition here. I quote them as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""41. Counsel at the trial did not raise the point now taken and, accordingly, the appellant requires leave pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon it. Mr. Button read the affidavit of trial counsel in support of the grant of leave. Relevantly counsel stated:-  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'I did not seek any elaboration or further direction from his Honour in relation to the issue or recklessness on the part of the accused as to lack of consent on the part of the complainant. The reason I did not seek any further elaboration or direction was not because I saw a tactical advantage in the direction that had been given. I regarded the direction as an accurate summary of the law.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         42. In  
         Regina v. Moussa 
          [2001] NSWCCA 427, Howie, J. (in a judgment with which Giles, JA. and Carruthers, AJ. agreed) observed at [60] and [63]:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'It may well be the case that, if the failure to seek a direction or warning was a result of a considered and competent decision made for tactical reasons, it would be virtually impossible for the appellant to obtain leave to rely upon the point because no miscarriage of justice could have occurred. But in my view it should not be taken to be the case that leave will automatically be granted simply because the proffered explanation is that counsel overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject. Nor is it more likely that leave will be granted simply because counsel can no longer indicate why the point was not taken at the trial. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           At the end of the day the question, with which this court is concerned, is whether the conduct of the trial may have resulted in a miscarriage of justice and that question is not necessarily answered in favour of the appellant simply because of decision, errors or oversights by counsel falling short of incompetence. Trial counsel has a duty both to the client and the court to take objections or seek redirections where appropriate:  
           Regina v. Roberts 
            [2001] NSWCCA 163. Like other aspects of the conduct of defence counsel during the course of the trial, a failure to seek a direction or warning will not necessarily result in a miscarriage of justice, even if counsel was negligent:  
           Regina v. Birks 
            (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. If leave is required under Rule 4, then the appellant has to persuade this court that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred before leave is granted:  
           Tripodina and Morabito 
            (1988) 35 A. Crim. R. 183 at 191;  
           Regina v. Williamson & Morrell 
            (NSWCCA, 11 October 1991). On the other hand, if the point is taken at trial, the Crown will have the onus of persuading this court that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice:  
           Clarke 
            (1995) 78 A. Crim. R. 226. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         43. I respectfully agree with those observations. Trial counsel's frank acknowledgment that he sought no redirection on this topic, because he considered the directions given to be an accurate summary of the law, might be thought to underline that this was a case in which recklessness was not an issue. In the event that recklessness was an issue one might have expected counsel to have given consideration to the directions to be given on this topic and to have been astute to ensure they were adequate. 
         
        
        
         
         44. In  
         Regina v. Tripodina 
          (1988) 35 A. Crim. R. 183, Yeldham, J. (in a judgment with which Carruthers and McInerney, JJ. agreed) observed:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'Furthermore, the fact that no objection was taken at the trial is in many cases cogent evidence of the fact that, having regard to the atmosphere at the trial and the manner in which It was conducted, the matter later complained of was not regarded as being of significance, or likely to give rise to any miscarriage of justice. The authorities to which I have referred emphasised that the leave required by Rule 4 is not to be lightly granted. Generally speaking, such leave will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: see  
           Wilde 
            (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 369.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         48. In  
         Regina v. Clarke 
          (195) 78 A. Crim. R. 226, Hunt, CJ. at CL. (in a judgment with which McInerney, J. agreed) observed:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'The requirements of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules that leave be granted before a misdirection will be allowed as a ground of appeal where objection was not taken at the trial are not some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the rule is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury ( 
           Knight 
            (unreported) NSWCCA, 18 December 1990). Where a wrong direction is given which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn to it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error may have operated fails to comply with that duty, simply standing by and allowing the error to occur, any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community (cf.  
           McKinney 
            (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 488;  
           Cleland 
            (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 10). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           It was submitted that the errors made by the judge were of a fundamental nature which went to the root of the proceedings so that the trial could not fairly be said to have been a trial at al ( 
           Glennon 
            (1994) 179 CLR 1 at 8). However, whether a misdirection is of such a nature must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and it is appropriate in determining that question to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of both the prosecution and the defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error ( 
           Wilde 
            at 373-374;  
           Glennon 
            at 8). Such an assessment in the present case reveals a very strong Crown case and a very weak defence case. The errors made were manifestly not fundamental in the way suggested. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           I would grant leave to add the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal, but I have serious doubts as to whether it is appropriate that further leave be granted in relation to them in accordance with Rule 4. That is because, even if the appellant was able to show a miscarriage as a result of these misdirections in order to obtain such leave ( 
           Tripodina 
            at 1910195;  
           Abusafiah 
            at 536) the Crown must in my view succeed in the application of the proviso to s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act to have the appeal dismissed, upon the basis that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice and notwithstanding the different onus's of proof involved. The distinction between a miscarriage and a substantial miscarriage has been maintained ( 
           Dietrich 
            (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 337;  
           Asquith 
            (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 250 at 260).' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         49. In determining whether there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice, the court looks to whether an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it does to the root of the proceedings:  
         Wilde v. The Queen 
          (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372-373. In  
         Glennon v. The Queen 
          (1993-1994) 179 CLR 1 at 8, Mason, CJ., Brennan and Toohey, JJ. observed of the test in  
         Wilde 
         :- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'But the majority stressed that there is no mechanical formula or rigid test to be applied to determine whether an irregularity is of this nature; each case will depend on its own circumstances ( 
           Wilde 
            at 373) and, in determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error ( 
           Wilde 
            at 374).' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         50. In the event that the error is not one of such a fundamental nature as to go to the root of the trial, before this court could conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred it must be satisfied that if the misdirection had not been given the jury would have inevitably reached the same verdict:  
         Mraz v. The Queen 
          (1955( 93 CLR 493;  
         Driscoll v. The Queen 
          (1977) 137 CLR 517; and  
         Festa v. The Queen 
          [2001] HCA 72. As the joint judgment in  
         Glennon 
          noted this is so even if the case against the accused is otherwise a strong one; at p.9 citing  
         Domican v. The Queen 
          (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 565 to 566;  
         Wilde 
          at 371-372."" 
         
        
       
     39 I do not see the directions as inadequate for this trial and its issues, and I consider Rule 4 applies to this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground Four 
        
       
     40 The written submission in support of this ground relied to an extent on the asserted inadequacy of the directions. It is not necessary, considering the rejection of Ground two, to consider that aspect of the argument further. As far as the ground asserts that the verdict was unsupported by the evidence, it must be rejected as there was not only a sufficiency of evidence of identification, but the evidence, including that by way of admission of the presence of the appellant in and about the scene of the robbery, was plainly adequate to support the conviction. There was no challenge on this ground to the credit of the victim merely to the reliability of his evidence. I do not see that the suggested frailties so undermined the evidence as to render it unsafe for the jury to act on it. So much is clear from my views on ground one. There was no such matter as is referred to in Regina v. M (1994) 181 CLR 487 as would warrant the upholding of this ground. It must be rejected. 
      
       
     41 I now turn to the remaining grounds. 
      
       
        
       Ground Three 
        
       
     42 It was submitted that his Honour fell into error when he directed the jury that the applicant's statement in his electronically recorded interview (ERISP) were ""not evidence in the same sense as the testimony of a witness given on oath. The accused's statements in the ERISP are not subjected to any test by way of cross-examination. You should regard those statements as one possible version of the facts, giving them such weight as you think they should receive, having regard to all the evidence in the case"". 
      
       
     43 It is common ground the statements were evidence of the assertions of fact contained in them (Regina v. Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426). But it was not suggested at trial that the accused's exculpatory statements in the ERISP should not be considered as his Honour had directed the jury they should. Indeed, the directions sought by the applicant's counsel at trial included:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Where the accused has not given evidence, but has given an exculpatory statement out of court, judges should direct that:- 
         
        
        
         
         - Although there was no sworn evidence from the accused, there were the exculpatory answers given to the police proved in evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         - Such answers are available to be considered and the jury should give such weight to them as they see fit, bearing in mind that they did not have the opportunity to observe the accused giving evidence or to hear any explanation tested in cross-examination."" 
         
        
       
     44 The full direction given by his Honour was:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I have already told you ladies and gentlemen, on more than one occasion, that you are the sole judges of the facts and although that is your role, and indeed your right, you must not exercise that right capriciously or irrationally. You are not entitled to find as a fact what you would like the fact to be. You are obliged by the oath each of you took to determine all relevant issues of fact according to the evidence that has been presented during the course of the trial. That evidence comprises what has been said by the various witnesses whom you have seen and heard and the various exhibits which have been produced and which you will have with you in the jury room. That material, that is the evidence in this case, is the only material that you should have regard to in your deliberations. 
         
        
        
         
         In addition to the oral evidence and the exhibits which have been tendered in the case, there is also the material contained in the ERISP, that is the document which you have which is a transcript of the electronically recorded interview with suspected person. The Crown tendered the ERISP and what is contained in the ERISP is evidence for the accused as well as evidence against him and like all evidence in the case, it is a matter for you as to whether you believe it or not. It is for you to determine whether you accept or reject all of that evidence or whether you accept some part or parts and reject others. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown relies on the admissions made by the accused in the ERISP as evidence against the accused. The ERISP also contains exculpatory statements made by the accused and those exculpatory statements become evidence of the truth of the facts stated in favour of the accused. The weight to be attached to those statements is a matter for you. It is not evidence in the same sense as the testimony of a witness given on oath. The accused's statements in the ERISP are not subjected to any test by way of cross-examination. You should regard those statements as one possible version of the facts, giving them such weight as you think they should receive, having regard to all the evidence in the case. During the course of the ERISP and towards the end of the ERISP, the accused was invited by the police officer, Senior Constable Bird, to participate in a line up and he declined to do so. You must not draw ay inference adverse to the accused because he took notice of the advice given to him by the police officer that he was not obliged to take part in the line up and declined to do so. And I repeat, you must not draw any inference adverse to him because he accepted that advice. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence, ladies and gentlemen, is as I have just defined it and that is the only material that you should rely upon to reach your conclusions and you should reach your conclusions totally excluding any considerations of sympathy or any other emotion. You are judges and acting judicially requires you to shed any emotion and to act only upon evidence and according to reason. Now I tell you that there is no rule that you must or should put any witness and that witness' evidence in a compartment as being either reliable or unreliable. You have a right as judges of the facts, to say of any witness, and that includes the material in the ERISP, considered and dealt with in the way that I have outlined, that you accept all of his or her evidence or that you reject all of his or her evidence or that you accept part but reject other parts. You can arrive at a conclusion that any witness is accurate on some matters but inaccurate or mistaken in respect of others. There is one observation that I should make ladies and gentlemen in relation to the fact finding exercise and that is something which both counsel have addressed your attention to and which is important to remember and when you think about it, it is self evident and that is from our everyday experience in life, we know that anybody may be thoroughly and absolutely honest but nonetheless at the same time, be totally wrong about something they thought they saw, heard or did. 
         
        
        
         
         There is one other direction that I should give you at this point ladies and gentlemen and that is this. The accused did not give any explanation by himself giving evidence in respect to the Crown's case. Instead he chose to rely upon the material that was contained in the ERISP. There are a number of important directions of law which I must give you in relation to that. An accused person my always, by himself or by calling evidence, make a response to the case presented by the Crown in the way of an explanation for the whole or parts of a Crown's case, but there is no obligation to do so. As I have already pointed out, the Crown bears the obligation and onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. The accused bears no onus. He is presumed to be innocent until you have been satisfied by the Crown that he is guilty. Although the accused may give evidence in relation to the whole or any part of the crown's case by way of explanation for it, or by way of additional matters which he may raise, he may equally elect to give no such explanation or call any evidence in that regard. He is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt. I direct you as a matter of law that the accused's silence in court is not evidence against the accused and you must not draw any inference adverse to the accused because he has not given evidence in court. His election not to give evidence must not be used by you to fill up gaps in the Crown case or to make up what you regard as deficiencies or defects in the Crown's case. The election of the accused not to give evidence must not be regarded by you as any indication that he is guilt or that he believes himself to be guilty of the offence. And I remind you again, ladies and gentlemen, that you must not draw any inference adverse to the accused because he has exercised that right."" 
         
        
       
     45 As will be seen, the latter portion of his Honour's directions are relevant to ground 3A. No relevant objection or application for re-direction occurred. 
      
       
     46 His Honour had, immediately prior to these observations, appropriately directed the jury on onus and standard of proof in conventional terms. I do not consider that there was any risk that the jury would not, in the light of these directions, appreciate that if the exculpatory statements of the accused reflected a reasonable possibility of his not being the robber, then the proper verdict was acquittal. 
      
       
     47 That portion of his Honour's directions of which complaint was made is not contrary to any statutory provision nor incorrect at common law. What was said was in my view accurate and appropriate as well as obvious to the jury anyway. It did not amount to the impermissible comment proscribed by s.20 of the Evidence Act 1995 as was submitted, and Rule 4 applies. This ground must be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3A 
        
       
     48 Complaint is made that his Honour should have directed the jury in addition to the directions I have set out that ""there may have been reasons why the accused did not give evidence"". He was not asked to give any such direction. Indeed, as I read counsel's submissions on 5 September 2001 at p.46, such a direction was positively disclaimed. Such a direction may be positively adverse to an accused's interest. In Regina v. Bargwann (CCA, unreported 15 June 1998), Newman, J., with whom Studdert and Simpson, JJ. agreed, referred to the judgment of Gleeson, CJ. in Regina v. OGD (CCA, unreported 3 June 1997) which noted the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Third, it is ordinarily necessary to warn a jury that there may be reasons, unknown to them, why an accused person, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence, remains silent."" 
         
        
       
     49 Newman, J. said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""In  
         OGD 
         , Gleeson, CJ., in dealing with the third of the matters which should be dealt with in directions where an accused fails to give evidence, referred to it being ordinarily necessary to warn a jury in the terms he expressed. In my view, the phrase 'ordinarily necessary' means that it is only in extraordinary circumstances that a warning of the type referred to should not be given. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not, in my view, necessary in giving such a direction for a trial judge to refer to any specific matter relating to the trial which might be a reason why an accused person remains silent. A direction in general terms is adequate. There could be general reasons such as cultural differences which make an accused person apprehensive about being subjected to cross-examination and the like of which not only the jury but the judge would be unaware which could cause an accused person to elect not to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         There is nothing in the facts of this case which, in my view, give rise to any extraordinary circumstances which would have obviated the need for the learned trial judge to give the third direction referred to by Gleeson, CJ. in  
         OGD's 
          case. 
         
        
        
         
         In failing to give the direction his Honour failed to balance the effect of the  
         Jones v. Dunkel  
         direction which he had otherwise correctly given. It follows that in my view his Honour fell into error by failing to so direct."" 
         
        
       
     50 As Justice Newman expressly noted, those views were in the context of a summing up in which a Jones v. Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 direction had been given against the accused arising from his failure to give evidence. The rationale of the direction was to balance the Jones v. Dunkel direction. That summing up was very different to this. Here, there was no Jones v. Dunkel direction nor even reference to the lack of the accused's evidence being a ""failure"" (a term which, in my view, is unfortunate in this context). The views in Bargwann (supra) and OGD (supra) were expressed prior to the decision of the High Court in Azzopardi & Davis v. The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 to which decision the trial judge in this case was referred. In that regard, the trial judge said on considering with counsel prior to the summing up, what directions were appropriate:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I've got to be very careful there because I've got Azzopardi's case haven't I."" 
         
        
       
     51 In Azzopardi (supra), the majority does not hold or suggest any such direction should be given, but did refer to a passage in the trial judge's charge to the jury in which the direction was given. This particular direction, however, attracted no attention from the High Court justices even though it was not apparently given by the trial judge in Davis (supra), the case determined by the High Court at the same time. 
      
       
     52 I am not persuaded that since Azzopardi (supra) the observation in Bargwann (supra) that such a direction should be given, except in extraordinary circumstances, or that in OGD that the direction is ordinarily necessary, where a jury is directed as here in accordance with the views of the majority in Azzopardi (supra) and where no Jones v. Dunkel direction is given are applicable. The direction's absence does not, as was submitted, add force to the submission rejected when considering ground three that there was some implicit contravention of s.20 of the Evidence Act 1995. Again, Rule 4 applies. This ground, too, must be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     53 It was for the foregoing reasons that I concluded that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

      REGINA v Dale Shane WHYTE 
      
      
       
        
       FACTS 
        
       Following his plea of guilty to one charge of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm Dale Shane Whyte was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and three months with a non-parole period of twelve months. The Crown appealed against the sentence imposed. 
        
        
       HELD 
        
       Per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ agreeing (with additional observations by Mason P and McClellan J): 
        
        
       A 
         
       Wong v The Queen 
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 does not require this Court to overrule the guideline judgments in  
       R v Jurisic 
        (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and  
       R v Henry 
        (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
        
        
       B  
       Since the High Court judgment in  
       Wong,  
       a new statutory power has been conferred on the Court. 
        
        
       C 
        By force of ss21A(4), 42A and 37A of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        1999, sentencing judges are obliged to “take into account” a guideline judgment given by this Court. 
        
        
       D 
        Guideline judgments should be expressed so as not to impermissibly confine the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Guideline judgments are to be taken into account as a “check” or “sounding board” or “guide”, but not as a “rule” or “presumption”. 
        
        
       E 
        There is no incompatibility between the Court issuing guideline judgments and its role as a repository of Commonwealth judicial power.  
       Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        (1996) 189 CLR 51 discussed. 
        
        
       F 
        Numerical guidelines have a role to play in achieving equality of justice where, as a matter of practical reality, there is tension between the principle of individualised justice and the principle of consistency. 
        
        
       G  
       It is appropriate to exercise the power under s37A and reformulate the  
       Jurisic  
       guideline. The numerical guideline has been significant in ensuring the adequacy and consistency of sentences. 
        
        
       A Typical Case 
        
        
       A frequently recurring case of an offence under s52A has the following characteristics. 
        
        
         
         (i) Young offender. 
          
          
         (ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
          
          
         (iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
          
          
         (iv) The victim is a stranger. 
          
          
         (v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates. 
          
          
         (vi) Genuine remorse. 
          
          
         (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
         
        
        
       Guideline with respect to custodial sentences 
        
        
       A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
        
        
       Aggravating Factors 
        
         
         (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Degree of speed. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.

       Guideline with respect to length of custodial sentences 
        
        
       For offences against ss52A(1) and (3) for the typical case: 
        
        
       Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. 
        
        
       For the aggravated version of each offence under s52A an appropriate increment is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment. 
        
        
       The guideline focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender will also require consideration. 
        
        
       Circumstances of the Case 
        
        
       The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, however, the Court should exercise its discretion not to interfere.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. On 12 November 2001 the Respondent was arraigned upon an indictment containing one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty. On 13 November, after the close of the Crown case, the Respondent changed his plea to guilty. The trial judge sentenced the Respondent to imprisonment for a term of two years and three months commencing on 28 November 2001, expiring on 27 February 2004 with a non-parole period of twelve months expiring on 27 November 2002. The Respondent was disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for a period of four years commencing on 8 April 2000. 
      
       
        
       The Effect of  
       Wong v The Queen 
        
       
     2 These proceedings involve the offence considered in the first guideline judgment of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. In Wong v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 79, the High Court overturned this Court’s subsequent guideline judgment in R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. (I will hereafter refer to the High Court decision as “Wong”.) The decision in Wong cast doubts on all guideline judgments including Jurisic. 
      
       
     3 This case was heard together with three other cases which raised similar issues. However, the Court was able to dispose of the other cases without considering the issue of principle. (See R v Cook [2002] NSWCCA 140, R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 and R v Lee [2002] NSWCCA 236.) 
      
       
     4 Mr G Smith appeared with Ms E Wilkins for the Crown in all cases. Different counsel appeared for the various offenders and made submissions on the issue of principle. Mr C Craigie SC appeared with Mr H Cox for Sharma, Mr T Game SC appeared with Mr H Dhanji for Lee, Mr P Kintominas appeared for Cook and Mr F Thraves appeared for Whyte. The Crown Advocate, Mr R Cogswell SC appeared with Mr M Buscombe and Ms B Baker for the Attorney General and Mr A Haesler appeared for the Senior Public Defender. The Senior Public Defender intervened pursuant to statutory provision, to which I will presently refer, giving that office a right to appear in circumstances where the Court may give a guideline judgment. Mr Thraves adopted the submissions of the Senior Public Defender on these issues. 
      
       
     5 It is necessary to identify the particular respects in which Wong is binding on this Court and which impinge upon the continuing authority of Jurisic. It is also desirable for this Court to reconsider Jurisic, including the way Jurisic was explained in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, in the light of the reasoning in Wong, even in those respects in which that reasoning may not be binding on this Court. 
      
       
     6 In Wong, four judgments were delivered. Gleeson CJ and Callinan J would have dismissed the appeal. Their Honours made observations with respect to the appropriateness of guideline judgments. In a joint judgment, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ made a number of observations critical of guideline judgments. If that judgment had represented a majority opinion of the High Court, then the impact of Wong upon Jurisic and Henry in terms of binding precedent, would have been much clearer than it in fact is. Kirby J agreed with the joint judgment that the appeal be allowed. However, Kirby J did not join in all of the reasoning of the joint judgment with respect to guideline judgments. In those respects in which Kirby J agreed with the joint judgment, this Court is bound to apply the principles reflected in that reasoning to other guideline judgments insofar as such principles impinge on them. (See e.g. Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 96 at 112-113.) 
      
       
     7 This Court’s guideline in Wong (set out at 48 NSWLR 340 at [142]) comprised a table consisting of one column of weights of various ranges, and a second column setting out ranges of years, being terms of imprisonment, referable to each range of weights. 
      
       
     8 The High Court judgment in Wong establishes that the guideline set out in the form of that table was incompatible with the provisions of s16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The joint judgment held that this was in error in that it identified weight as “the chief factor” to be taken into account on sentence (at [56], [67], [70], [73] and [87]). Accordingly, their Honours held that the guideline was incompatible with s16A of the Crimes Act which required a wide range of factors to be taken into account (at [71]-[73]). 
      
       
     9 Kirby J also concluded that the guideline was incompatible with s16A (see [136]). That section required the exercise of an individual discretion that took into account all of the factors identified in it (see [132]-[135]). The guideline contemplated a result derived from the “single identified factor, namely the weight of the narcotic substance” ([135] and see [138]). 
      
       
     10 The two dissenting judges, Gleeson CJ and Callinan J both indicated an inclination to the view that there was an inconsistency with s16A, but did not need to decide that issue ([31] and [167]). 
      
       
     11 The incompatibility of the guideline considered in Wong with s16A of the Crimes Act is clearly part of the ratio of the High Court decision. This aspect has no direct applicability to any other guideline judgment of this Court, including Jurisic. Wong was the only guideline which the Court ever gave with respect to a Commonwealth offence.  
      
       
     12 The guidelines formulated in Jurisic and Henry  differ from that formulated in Wong. In neither case was there a comprehensive table setting out sentencing ranges for the entire conspectus of possible offences. In each case the numerical guideline was more focused. Nevertheless, some aspects of the reasoning in the majority judgments in Wong, do impinge on the guidelines in these cases. 
      
       
     13 The joint judgment in Wong distinguished between the articulation of principles by an appellate court and the articulation of proposed results by such a court. (See [45], [56], [58], [65] and [83].) The identification of results that should be reached in future cases was distinguished from “considerations which a judge should take into account in arriving at those results” ([80]). 
      
       
     14 Furthermore, the joint judgment said at [78]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Numerical guidelines either take account of only some of the relevant considerations or would have to be so complicated as to make their application difficult, if not impossible. Most importantly of all, numerical guidelines cannot address considerations of proportionality. Their application cannot avoid outcomes which fail to reflect the circumstances of the offence  
         and  
         the offender (with absurd and unforeseen results) if they do not articulate and reflect the principles which will lead to the just sentencing of offenders whose offending behaviour is every bit as diverse as is their personal history and circumstances.” 
         
        
       
     15 Kirby J, the other member of the majority in Wong, did not adopt the same approach as the joint judgment in this regard. His Honour referred to “permissible” guidelines of referable principle ([139]). His Honour also said at [137]: 
      
       
        
         
         “I also support the notion that publicly available guidelines, in the sense of relevant factors declared by an appellate court, are to be preferred to undisclosed or secret “tariffs” or rules of thumb that are not so readily susceptible to the debate in public, including in a court which has relevant sentencing responsibilities and powers.” 
         
        
       
     16 It is not apparent that his Honour’s references to “referable principle” or “relevant factors” is intended to exclude any reference to what the joint judgment called a “result”. In other respects, Kirby J expressly adopted the terminology of the joint judgment. (See e.g. the last sentence of [137].) I do not understand Kirby J to conclude that a numerical guideline is, per se, impermissible in all circumstances. His Honour criticised “secret ‘tariffs’ or rules of thumb” ([137]). One of the virtues of a numerical guideline, is to overcome the lack of transparency by which sentencing judges acquire an understanding of the ‘going rate’. His Honour also indicated an open mind on the utility of such “innovation” to promote consistency in sentencing (at [144]). 
      
       
     17 Gleeson CJ did not adopt the approach of the joint judgment. His Honour said at [9]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… appellate courts, both for the purpose of making and explaining their own decisions, and for the guidance of primary judges, may find it useful to refer to information about sentences that have been imposed in comparable cases, and to indicate, subject to relevant discretionary considerations, the order of the sentence that might be expected to be attracted by a certain type of offender who commits a certain type of offence.” 
         
        
       
     18 This reasoning supports the kind of guideline given in Jurisic and Henry. 
      
       
     19 Kirby J expressly confined his conclusion in Wong to the opinion that the guidelines “were incompatible with the terms of the federal legislation” ([149]). His Honour was referring to both s16A of the Crimes Act and s235 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
      
       
     20 Kirby J identified an incompatibility between the guideline adopted by this Court in Wong and the Commonwealth legislation creating the offence. His Honour referred to the distinction expressed in s235 of the Customs Act between a “trafficable quantity” and a “commercial quantity”. This legislative scheme, his Honour held, excluded, (as described in submissions to the High Court) “the judicial creation of further sub-categories of offence” (at [125]). The table which this Court adopted in Wong identified five separate categories of “low level trafficable quantity, mid level trafficable quantity, high range trafficable quantity, low range commercial quantity and substantial commercial quantity”. 
      
       
     21 His Honour concluded at [129]-[131] that such “precise subclassifications“ which were “determined by reference only to the quantity of the substance” were inconsistent with the legislation creating the offence.  
      
       
     22 Kirby J referred with approval to the consideration of such issues by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v McDonnell [1997] 1 SCR 948. In that case, the Court was concerned with a differentiation adopted for sentencing purposes between “major” and “minor” sexual assaults. The difficulty of distinguishing a permissible separate treatment of a relevant consideration from an impermissible judicially created category of offence, is emphasised by the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada split 5/4 on this issue of characterisation in that case. 
      
       
     23 The joint judgment also referred to McDonnell, albeit not in the same way as did Kirby J. Their Honours referred to the distinction between the judicial and legislative functions, rather than the provisions of s235 of the Customs Act, and, referring to the two judgments in McDonnell, said at [82]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The majority held that it was not for the courts to create subsets of a legislatively identified offence. The point of difference between the members of the Court turned upon the degree to which the starting point given by the court below could or should be taken as prescriptive.” 
         
        
       
     24 The joint judgment in Wong referred to the “subset” or “subcategory” issue in the context of determining the jurisdiction and power of the Court to give a guideline judgment. 
      
       
     25 The joint judgment in Wong concluded at pars [83]-[88] that this Court had neither jurisdiction nor power to issue the guideline in Wong. The joint judgment focused on the form of the guideline in terms of the table published by this Court, which it characterised as a “table of future punishments” ([84] and see [88]) and as the “expected or intended results of future cases” ([83] and see [84]).  
      
       
     26 The joint judgment identified the power in s5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act as being one to “vary the sentence and impose such sentence” on the particular offender and added at [84]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It had no jurisdiction in respect of sentences passed or to be passed on others.” 
         
        
       
     27 The joint judgment also said at [84]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nothing in section 12 of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
          gave the Court any relevant additional jurisdiction or power.” 
         
        
       
     28 This last reference rejects as pertinent, the reliance which was placed on s12 in Wong in this Court (48 NSWLR 340 at [16]-[18]). Section 12 confers power on this Court to: 
      
       
        
         
         “… exercise in relation to proceedings of the court any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the Supreme Court on appeals or applications in civil matters …”. 
         
        
       
     29 As stated in Wong at 48 NSWLR 340 at [16], I had set out in Henry at [13]-[21] a broad range of decisions where intermediate appellate courts had issued guidelines in the exercise of a civil jurisdiction. 
      
       
     30 This part of the reasons of the joint judgment is not binding on this Court. It was not adopted by the other three members of the High Court, including the other member of the majority, Kirby J. (See at [124] and [144].) Gleeson CJ did not believe a question of power arose ([30]). 
      
       
     31 In Jurisic and Henry, five judge benches of this Court decided to adopt a guideline judgment system of the general character that had long existed in England and Wales. Unless required by binding authority, or persuaded that it was wrong to do so, this Court should not overrule these prior decisions. Wong does not require this Court to overrule Jurisic and Henry. In any event, after Wong, the New South Wales Parliament has intervened. 
      
       
        
       Statutory Intervention 
        
       
     32 In late 2001, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation conferring on this Court, with retrospective effect, a jurisdiction of the character which the joint judgment concluded the Court did not have. No submission was made to this Court that, on its proper construction, the legislation did not confer on the Court the power and jurisdiction which the joint judgment had said was absent.  
      
       
     33 The constitutional validity of this legislation was challenged and I will consider this submission below. 
      
       
     34 It was also submitted that the legislation did not have the effect of validating the guideline in Jurisic, because the procedures required by the new legislation to ensure that the Court receives submissions on the need for, and the contents of, a guideline, were not in fact followed when Jurisic was decided. 
      
       
     35 The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney relied on cl 41 in Sch 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section purports to validate guideline judgments given prior to the commencement of s37A. I will set out these sections below.  
      
       
     36 As counsel appearing for the offenders in the proceedings pointed out, cl 41 gives the “same force and effect” to a prior guideline as a guideline would have had if s37A had commenced before it was given, but only in circumstances that a guideline judgment “would have been validly given had s37A commenced before it was given”. Counsel drew the attention of the Court to the provisions of s37A(2) stating that the Court “is to give” the Senior Public Defender, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General an opportunity to appear “before giving a guideline judgment”. This, it was pointed out, was not done prior to the judgment in Jurisic. 
      
       
     37 These submissions would deprive cl 41 of all effect. However, it is not necessary to decide the case on this basis. As indicated above, this Court should follow its previous decisions in Jurisic and Henry. Furthermore, all the relevant parties were heard in the present proceedings. As will appear, for other reasons, it is appropriate to reformulate the guideline originally given in Jurisic. 
      
       
     38 There are five relevant statutes to which it will be convenient to refer as follows: 
      
       
     · Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (“the 1986 Act”).· Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sentencing Guidelines) Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”).· Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”).· Criminal Legislation Amendment Act 2001 (“the 2001 Act”).· Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (General Sentencing Principles) Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”). 
      
       
     39 Shortly after this Court’s judgment in Jurisic, the New South Wales Parliament gave statutory recognition to guideline judgments in the 1998 Act. This Act inserted a new Pt 8 into the 1986 Act. These provisions, with subsequent amendments, are now to be found in Pt 3 Div 4 of the 1999 Act. 
      
       
     40 Section 26(1) of the 1998 Act empowered the Court to “give a guideline judgment” upon application by the Attorney General. Provision was made for the Senior Public Defender to appear in such proceedings and to make submissions. This provision recognised the proper contradictor issue referred to in Wong at [45] and [165]. 
      
       
     41 The 1998 Act assumed that the Court had the jurisdiction and power which it had exercised in Jurisic to formulate a guideline. Section 26(4) inserted by the 1998 Act provided (now s37(4) of the 1999 Act, with an additional phrase): 
      
       
        
         
         “The powers and jurisdiction of the court to give a guideline judgment in proceedings under this section are the same as the powers and jurisdiction that it has to give a guideline judgment in a pending proceeding apart from this section.” 
         
        
       
     42 Similarly s28 inserted by the 1998 Act provided (now s40 of the 1999 Act): 
      
       
        
         
         “Nothing in this Part: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) limits any power or jurisdiction of the court to give a guideline judgment that the court has apart from section 26”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     43 The definition of a “guideline judgment” in the 1998 Act was: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Guideline judgment  
         means a judgment containing guidelines to be taken into account by courts sentencing offenders.” 
         
        
       
     44 The 1998 Act did not, however, expressly incorporate an obligation upon any court to take into account a guideline judgment. That, it appears, was presumed to flow from the terms of any such a judgment given by the court in the exercise of an inherent, implied or other statutory power. 
      
       
     45 As Gleeson CJ observed in Wong at [5]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The expressions ‘guidelines’ and ‘guideline judgments’ have no precise connotation.” 
         
        
        
       However, the sense in which the Parliament used these words in the 1998 Act is apparent from the circumstances in which it was enacted. 
        
       
     46 The timing of the 1998 Act, and the Second Reading Speech (see New South Wales, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 28 October 1998, 9190-9191) make it clear that the Parliament intended to refer to the kind of guideline judgment issued by this Court in Jurisic. There is, in my opinion, no proper basis on which the word “guideline” or “guidelines” in this statutory scheme can be read down to exclude guidelines which contain a quantitative element. 
      
       
     47 The 1999 Act was still directed to applications by the Attorney General (s37). The Act manifested no intention to alter the concept of ”guideline” from the 1998 Act. 
      
       
     48 Section 36 of the 1999 Act amended the definition of guideline judgment to read: 
      
       
        
         
         “Guideline judgment means a judgment containing guidelines to be taken into account by courts sentencing offenders, being: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) guidelines that apply generally, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) guidelines that apply to particular courts or classes of courts, to particular offences or classes of offences, to particular penalties or classes of penalties or to particular classes of offenders (but not to particular offenders).” 
           
          
         
        
       
     49 A definition of guideline proceeding was introduced: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Guideline proceedings 
           
         mean proceedings under s37 on an application for a guideline judgment referred to in that section.” 
         
        
       
     50 More detailed provision was made in the 1999 Act for participation in guideline proceedings by the Senior Public Defender and the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
      
       
     51 After the judgment of the High Court in Wong, the New South Wales Parliament passed the 2001 Act. The timing and content of the Act suggests that its purpose was to remove the doubt about this Court’s jurisdiction and power identified in the joint judgment. This is confirmed by the Second Reading Speech (see New South Wales, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 30 November 2001, 19300). The 1999 Act was amended in a number of pertinent respects. 
      
       
     52 The s36 definition of a guideline judgment was amended by deleting the words “containing guidelines” and inserting in lieu thereof “that is expressed to contain guidelines”.  
      
       
     53 Furthermore, the following additional sections were inserted into the 1999 Act: 
      
       
        
         
         “37A(1) The court may give a guideline judgment on its own motion in any proceedings considered appropriate by the Court, and whether or not it is necessary for the purpose of determining the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The Court is to give the Senior Public Defender, Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General an opportunity to appear as referred to in sections 38, 39 and 39A before giving a guideline judgment. 
         
        
        
         
         37B A guideline judgment given in proceedings under section 37 or 37A may be reviewed, varied, or revoked in a subsequent guideline judgment of the Court, whether or not given under the same section.” 
         
        
       
     54 The 2001 Act also amended the definition of guideline proceedings to read: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         guideline proceedings  
         means 
         
        
        
         
         (a) proceedings under section 37 on an application for a guideline judgment referred to in that section, and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) that part of proceedings that relates to the giving of a guideline judgment under section 37A.” 
         
        
       
     55 A new s42A was also inserted: 
      
       
        
         
         “42A A guideline that is expressed to be contained in a guideline judgment: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is in addition to any other matter that is required to be taken into account under Division 1 of Part 3, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) does not limit or derogate from any such requirement.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     56 Schedule 2 of the 1999 Act contains savings and transitional provisions. The 2001 Act inserted a new Part into that Schedule which included the following clauses: 
      
       
        
         
         “41 Any guideline judgment given by the Court of Criminal Appeal before the commencement of section 37A that would have been validly given had section 37A commenced before it was given has, and is taken always to have had, the same force and effect as it would have had if section 37A had commenced before it was given. 
         
        
        
         
         42 Section 37B extends to any guideline judgment given before the commencement of that section (whether under Division 4 of Part 3 or apart from that Division).” 
         
        
       
     57 At the time that the 2001 Act was passed, Div 1 of Pt 3 of the 1999 Act contained a limited number of matters which were obliged to be taken into account on sentencing: guilty plea (s22) and time served (s24). The 2002 Act inserted s21A into that Division of that Part. Section 21A refers to a wide range of matters, broadly based on s16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.  
      
       
     58 On the proper construction of s42A of the 1999 Act, the reference to matters that are “required to be taken into account under Div 1 of Pt 3” encompasses that Division of that Part as amended from time to time. Relevantly, this extends to s21A. This conclusion is reinforced by the legislative history. 
      
       
     59 Section 21A was inserted by the 2002 Act. The legislative history of the 2002 Act indicates that at the time the Parliament passed the 2001 Act it was cognisant of the relationship between the general sentencing principles legislation and the guideline judgment legislation. The 2002 Act finds its origin in an Act introduced as a private members Bill into the Legislative Council on 26 September 2001 as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Assaults on Aged Persons) Bill 2001. On 15 November 2001 the Government moved an amendment to that Bill in the Council. The Bill’s name was later changed to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (General Sentencing Principles) Bill but as amended on 15 November 2001 was otherwise in the form eventually enacted. 
      
       
     60 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (General Sentencing Principles) Bill was received in the Legislative Assembly from the Legislative Council on 30 November 2001. On that same day, i.e. 30 November 2001, the Criminal Legislation Amendment Bill i.e. the 2001 Act was introduced to the Assembly and immediately read for a second time. 
      
       
     61 Section 42A of the 1999 Act, as inserted by the 2001 Act, which refers to Div 1 of Pt 3 of the 1999 Act, must be understood to encompass not only the provisions of that Division as they existed at that time, but also future amendments, particularly the new s21A which was then envisaged and introduced but not yet passed. 
      
       
     62 The general sentencing principles set out in s21A are not exhaustive. Section 21A(4) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The matters to be taken into account by a court under this section are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under this Act or any other law.” 
         
        
       
     63 Notwithstanding the fact that s21A is in part modelled on s16A of the Commonwealth Act, the conclusion reached in Wong as to the incompatibility of a guideline with the legislative scheme does not apply to s21A by reason of the combined effect of s21A(4) and s42A. The steps in this reasoning are as follows: 
      
       
     (i) By s37A the court is empowered to “give a guideline judgment on its own motion”. 
      
       
     (ii) ‘Guideline judgment’ is defined in s36 to mean a judgment expressed to contain guidelines “to be taken into account by courts sentencing offenders”. 
      
       
        
         
         (iii) Accordingly, s37A empowers the court to give a judgment which contains guidelines to be taken into account by sentencing judges. 
          
          
         (iv) By force of s21A(4) a guideline given under s37A is a matter required or permitted to be taken into account “in addition to” the matters to be taken into account under s21A. 
          
          
         (v) By force of s42A(a) a guideline given under s37A is “in addition to” any matter required to be taken into account by s21A. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) By force of s42A(b) a guideline given under s37A “does not limit or denigrate from” any requirement of s21A. 
         
        
       
     64 Nevertheless, the similarity between s21A and s16A of the Commonwealth Act considered in Wong, is of significance for the form of any guideline to be given by the Court. A guideline must not be stated in such terms as may impede the ability of a sentencing judge to take into account the other factors set out in that, and other, sections. 
      
       
     65 Of particular significance for present purposes is that the legislative scheme now makes express provision for the effect of a guideline judgment. By reason of the combined effect of s21A(4) and s42A, and in light of the definition of what s37A authorises this court to do, sentencing judges are obliged, by force of statute, to “take into account” a guideline judgment given by this Court. What was implicit in the 1998 Act is made explicit by the 2001 Act. 
      
       
     66 The fact that a guideline judgment is given this statutory force is of significance beyond overcoming the doubt cast on the existence of any such jurisdiction or power by the joint judgment in Wong. It specifies the effect which a guideline judgment ought have on sentencing judges by force of statute. It is not necessary to decide whether this effect is intended to be an exhaustive statement in this respect or whether this Court could give a guideline judgment with some different effect. No submissions were directed to this issue. If the Court sought to travel beyond the statutory terminology, no doubt issues of compatibility with the scheme in s21A could arise, in the same way as they arose with respect to s16A of the Commonwealth Act in Wong. 
      
       
     67 This Court should proceed on the basis that the statutory effect on sentencing judges of a guideline judgment - that such a judgment should be “taken into account” - is a complete statement of that effect. The reasoning of the majority in Wong concluded that the effect of the guideline was greater than merely a matter to be taken into account. This conclusion played an important part in the reasons of the majority. 
      
       
        
       Prescription 
        
       
     68 Nothing in any of the judgments in Wong qualifies the general principle that it is appropriate for intermediate courts of appeal to lay down guidelines for the exercise of a discretion. As Mason and Deane JJ said in Norbis v Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 519: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it does not follow that, because a discretion is expressed in general terms, Parliament intended that the court should refrain from developing rules or guidelines affecting its exercise.” 
         
        
       
     69 Two issues arise. What, if any, is the effect of a failure to apply a guideline? What kinds of guidelines are permissible? 
      
       
     70 In Norbis Mason and Deane JJ contemplated the possibility that an appellate court could give a guideline with the effect of a binding rule and, accordingly, treat a failure to apply the guideline as itself a basis for finding that the exercise of a discretion had miscarried. Brennan J, whilst otherwise agreeing with Mason and Deane JJ, dissented in this respect in Norbis. For the reasons I identified in Henry at [22]-[28], authorities from a number of different areas of the law in which guidelines have been adopted in the context of a discretion, support the conclusion of Brennan J. In Jurisic I adopted the analysis in R v De Havilland (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 109 at 114 and concluded at 220–221 that guidelines were not binding in this sense. (This was confirmed in Henry at [29]-[31].) Wong affirms this approach. 
      
       
     71 Nevertheless, the majority judgments in the High Court in Wong identified an impermissibly prescriptive quality in the guideline given by this Court in that case. 
      
       
     72 In Jurisic, I stated the effect of a guideline judgment on a sentencing judge in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Such guidelines are intended to be indicative only. They are not intended to be applied to every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing judges.” (220 C-D) 
         
        
        
         
         “[Guidelines] represent a relevant indicator, much as trial judges have always regarded statutory maximum penalties as an indicator.” (221A) 
         
        
       
     73 In Henry, I quoted that sentence and added at [31]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, where a guideline is not to be applied by a trial judge, this Court would expect that the reasons for that decision be articulated, so that the public interest in the perception of consistency in sentencing decisions can be served and this Court can be properly informed in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.” 
         
        
       
     74 In Wong, I made a number of further observations about the effect on sentencing judges of a guideline judgment of this Court which attracted comment in the majority judgments in the High Court. 
      
       
     75 First, I reiterated the observations in Jurisic and Henry that a guideline was “indicative only” and “non-binding”. (See 48 NSWLR 340 at [32] and [142].) The joint judgment in Wong observed at [43] that such statements were not intended to convey “that the guideline may be ignored in determining sentences in future cases”.  
      
       
     76 Secondly, I said at [125]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… by providing guidance to trial judges it is less likely that sentences will be imposed which suggest a need for appellate review.” 
         
        
        
       The joint judgment observed at [44] that: 
        
        
         
         “… it is highly likely that the publication of a guideline judgment will affect what sentences trial judges impose. The … identified consequences may be accepted as not only likely to follow but also intended to follow … the Court’s intention is clear. It intended that thereafter sentencing judges should take account of what was set out in the guidelines.” 
         
        
       
     77 Thirdly, I said at [22] that the word “proper” in s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act involved the identification of “what is, or should be, the appropriate pattern of sentencing” for an offence. The joint judgment observed at [43] that the pattern: 
      
       
        
         
         “… is a record of what is thereafter to be regarded as ‘appropriate’. At least to that extent the judgment is intended, therefore, to be prescriptive.” 
         
        
       
     78 Fourthly, at [141] I referred to sentences outside the ranges in the table as liable to “attract the close scrutiny of this Court:”. The joint judgment at [80] referred to this observation as indicating the effect of a guideline to be that “Departure from it must be justified”. 
      
       
     79 Finally, in this Court in Wong, Simpson J observed at [190] that: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it is to be expected, and indeed is intended, that sentencing courts will, generally speaking, adhere to the range of sentences promulgated as appropriate.”  
         
        
       
     80 Simpson J did not agree with the Court’s decision to promulgate a guideline in Wong. In the High Court, both the joint judgment at [44] fn 38 and Kirby J at [130] and [137] fn 198 referred to her Honour’s observations in support of their conclusion as to what the majority in this Court in Wong “intended”. None of the majority judgments in Jurisic, Henry or Wong were so expressed. 
      
       
     81 On the basis of these five matters, the joint judgment concluded at [83]: 
      
       
        
         
         “For the reasons that have already been given, the guideline stated in the present matters was intended to have prescriptive effect.” 
         
        
       
     82 Kirby J expressly agreed with this conclusion at [137]. 
      
       
     83 I readily accept that the intention of this Court, insofar as intention is material, was that “sentencing judges should take account of … guidelines”, to use the formulation in the joint judgment at [44]. As I understand the joint judgment in Wong, even a guideline which was merely a matter “to be taken into account” would have an impermissibly “prescriptive character”. On that basis, according to the joint judgment, a guideline which represents “a relevant indicator” for sentencing judges (which was the use to which I expressly referred in Jurisic at 221A and repeated in Henry at [30]) would be impermissibly prescriptive. Similarly, the further observation in Henry at [31] that this Court would expect a sentencing judge to articulate reasons for not applying a guideline would also be impermissibly prescriptive. 
      
       
     84 I do not understand Kirby J to have shared the joint judgment’s reasoning in this regard. His Honour gave particular emphasis at [137] to the fourth and fifth matters identified above, i.e. the “close scrutiny” reference and the observations of Simpson J.  
      
       
     85 These parts of the reasoning in Wong are affected by the new statutory regime which empowers the Court to give a guideline judgment that sentencing judges must take into account. 
      
       
     86 The observations in this Court in Wong about “close scrutiny” went beyond what this Court said in Jurisic and Henry. It may also be that those observations are inconsistent with the new statute, by giving a guideline judgment greater effect than that for which the statute provides. It is not necessary to decide this issue. However, the statute does, it appears to me, validate the original approach in Jurisic, i.e. that a guideline judgment is a relevant indicator, in the sense that it must be taken into account. 
      
       
     87 In a judgment delivered in this Court prior to the argument in the High Court in Wong, I emphasised that guideline judgments were “intended to be indicative only” (R v Karacic (2001) 121 A Crim R 7 at [52]). I also referred to some observations of Winneke P in R v Ngui and Tiong (2000) 1 VR 579 at [13] that: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the utility of the relevant guidelines expressed in  
         Wong’s case 
          will be as a ‘sounding board’ or ‘a check’ against the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.” 
         
        
       
     88 In Karacic at [52], I adopted this formulation as equivalent to the use of guidelines as “appropriate indicators”. 
      
       
     89 In Wong at [123], Kirby J referred to the observations of Winneke P in Ngui and Tiong to the use of guidelines for purposes of a “sounding board” or a “check” with approval. His Honour indicated that if the guidelines in Wong were used in this way, they would not have been incompatible with the legislative scheme there under consideration. (See also [144].) The joint judgment also referred to the relevant passage of the judgment of Winneke P in Ngui and Tiong with approval, albeit not with express reference to the terminology of “sounding board” or “check” (see at [85]). 
      
       
     90 To similar effect are the observations of Callinan J in Wong about State legislation making provision for guidelines. His Honour referred to such a guideline at [168] as: 
      
       
        
         
         “… merely indicative starting points, not to be rigidly or mechanistically applied, and that the trial judge still has a real, judicial sentencing discretion to exercise of the kind discussed by this Court in  
         House v The King 
         ”. 
         
        
       
     91 There is discernible in the High Court judgments in Wong an apprehension, often stated in other cases about guidelines, that notwithstanding express statements about their limited role, guidelines may, in practice, have the effect of impermissibly confining the exercise of discretion. 
      
       
     92 Such an apprehension was expressed by Winneke P in Ngui and Tiong at [12]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Experience in other areas of the law has shown that judicially expressed guidelines can have a tendency, with the passage of time, to fetter judicial discretion by assuming the status of rules of universal application which they were never intended to have. It would, in my opinion, be unfortunate if such a trend were to emerge in the sentencing process where the exercise of the judge’s discretion, within established principles, to fix a just sentence according to the individual circumstances of the case before him or her is fundamental to our system of criminal justice.” 
         
        
       
     93 This passage was quoted with approval in the joint judgment in Wong at [85]. Their Honours also said at [80]: 
      
       
        
         
         “If a table that is published is intended to found arguments in future cases that the discretion exercised in that future case miscarried, whatever may be the caveats that might be entered at the time of promulgating the table, it becomes, in fact, a rule of binding effect.” 
         
        
       
     94 Similarly, Kirby J referred to this Court’s statement that guidelines were not “binding in any formal sense” as “mollifying words” which must be read together with the statement that sentences outside the range would “attract the close scrutiny” of the Court of Criminal Appeal (see [137]).  
      
       
     95 Callinan J also reflected apprehension about the practical effect of guidelines at [165] when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Despite the qualifications that their makers express, they also do have, and in practice will inevitably come to assume, in some circumstances, a prescriptive tone and operation.” 
         
        
       
     96 The significance of the terminology and form of a guideline was also considered by the House of Lords in White v White [2001] 1 AC 596 in which their Lordships were concerned with a similar issue which the High Court considered in Mallet v Mallet (1984) 156 CLR 605. These cases involved the discretion to determine the division of marital property and the application of a guideline that an equality of division was an appropriate starting point.  
      
       
     97 The issue of terminology arose in White. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 606 expressed disapproval of the language of “starting point” on the basis that: 
      
       
        
         
         “… a starting point principle of general application would carry a risk that in practice it would be treated as a legal presumption …” 
         
        
       
     98 In White Lord Nicholls nevertheless concluded at 605: 
      
       
        
         
         “Before reaching a firm conclusion … a judge would always be well advised to check his tentative views against the yardstick of equality of division. As a general guide, equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so. The need to consider and articulate reasons for departing from equality would help the parties and the court to focus on the means to ensure the absence of discrimination.” 
         
        
       
     99 His Lordship went on to say that this approach does not “introduce a presumption of equal division” (at 605). Nor did the Court adopt a “presumption” of equality. His Lordship said at 606: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it should be possible to use equality as a form of check for the valuable purpose already described without it being treated as a legal presumption of equal division.” 
         
        
       
     100 Lord Cooke of Thorndon took at different view. He said at 615: 
      
       
        
         
         “I doubt whether the labels ‘yardstick’ or ‘check’ will produce any result different from ‘guidelines’ or ‘starting point’.” 
         
        
       
     101 In Mallet the High Court considered the practice that had developed in the Family Court to adopt a general rule that property should be split 50/50 following dissolution of a marriage. (See at 609-610, 623-624 and 639-640.) The Full Court of the Family Court had rejected the proposition that there was a principle of equal division, but did adopt equality as a “convenient starting point”. (See as quoted at 613.9.)  
      
       
     102 Gibbs CJ rejected the language of starting points. His Honour said at 610.3: 
      
       
        
         
         “Even to say that in some circumstances equality should be the normal starting point is to require the courts to act on a presumption which is unauthorized by the legislation. The respective values of the contributions made by the parties must depend entirely on the facts of the case and the nature of the final order made by the court must result from a proper exercise of the wide discretionary power whose nature I have discussed, unfettered [by] the application of supposed rules for which the  
         Family Law Act 
          provides no warrant.” 
         
        
       
     103 His Honour concluded at 613.9: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it is not right for a judge to start with the assumption that the property should be divided between the parties in any pre-determined proportions.” 
         
        
       
     104 Mason J also rejected the Family Court’s approach of treating equality as “a convenient starting point”. He concluded that it appeared to have been accorded the status of a “legal presumption” in the Family Court. (See at p623.2 and 625.8.) His Honour also concluded that the approach ‘obscured’ (625.8) the statutory scheme which required the Court to take into account the respective contributions of husband and wife. It did so “by arbitrarily equating the direct financial contribution of one to the indirect contribution of the other as homemaker and parent” (625.8). 
      
       
     105 Similarly, Dawson J stated that the statute “admits of no presumptions in the consideration of the relevant circumstances” (647.7) and concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it is misleading, in my view, to speak, as the cases do, of equality of contribution between husband and wife as the starting point in the consideration of their property interests. A starting point is, in reality, another name for a presumption and to prescribe a starting point is to invite a disregard for the requirements of the section.” (647) 
         
        
       
     106 Deane J did not construe the references in the Family Court cases in this way. Specifically the reference in that case to a “convenient starting point” did not, his Honour concluded at 640.7: 
      
       
        
         
         “… involve the mistaken proposition that there is, in the case of a long marriage, a rule of law that an equal division of assets must be treated as prima facie or presumptively appropriate. What that reference to ’equality’ involves is the enunciation not of a legal principle or presumption but of a general counsel of experience on the subject of what constitutes, in some types of case, an appropriate starting point for the determination of the particular order which should be made in the particular circumstances of the individual case.” 
         
        
       
     107 One aspect of the reasoning of Lord Nicholls in White differs from that of the majority in Mallet. The reasoning of the High Court would classify the proposition that “equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so” as creating a “presumption” inconsistent with the statutory scheme. However, the majority of the High Court in Mallet shared his Lordship’s reservations about the terminology of “starting points”. 
      
       
     108 In contrast, in R v McDonnell the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously affirmed the idea of a guideline expressed in terms of a starting point. The difference between the five judge majority and the four judge minority in that case turned on the weight given by the intermediate court of appeal to the effect of deviation from the starting point. However, the idea of a starting point itself was accepted by all. (See e.g. at [43] in the majority judgment and the minority judgment at [58]-[86]. See also my summary of McDonnell in Henry  at [26]-[28].) 
      
       
     109 In subsequent judgments, the Supreme Court of Canada has reaffirmed that the use of starting points, including the fixing of ranges for particular categories of offences, is compatible with the sentencing judge’s duty to consider all relevant circumstances and the exercise of a general discretion. (See R v Stone [1999] 2 SCR 290 at [244]-[245]; R v Proulx [2000] 1 SCR 61 at [86]-[89]. See generally Bloos & Renke “Stopping Starting Points: R v McDonnell” (1997) 35 Alberta Law Rev 795 esp at 801-807.) 
      
       
     110 In Jurisic and Henry, I referred to the use of numerical guidelines by courts in many jurisdictions, particularly England and Wales. The general practice has not changed since that time. There has been a steady stream of new sentencing guideline judgments. (See e.g. R v Mashaollahi [2001] 1 Cr App R (S) 330 (importation of opium); R v Kelly & Donnelly [2001] 2 Cr App R (S) 341 (“racial aggravation”); R v Webbe [2002] 1 Cr App R (S) 82 (stolen goods); R v Nelson [2001] EWCA Crim 2264 (extended sentences).) The Court has also refused to adopt guidelines (R v Milford Haven Port Authority [2000] 2 Cr App R (S) 423 (environmental offences). 
      
       
     111 Furthermore, as I pointed out in Henry at [37]-[42] the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia has identified what it has referred to as “sentencing standards” in the form of an “appropriate sentencing range”. (See R v King (1988) 48 SASR 555 at 557-558; Police v Cadd (1997) 69 SASR 150 at 165-166, 172, 174, 175-177, 196-197 and 205.) The South Australian practice has continued since the High Court rejected the special leave application from one of four sentencing standard cases. (See Bini v The Queen (1994) 68 ALJR 859.) Some references in South Australian authority suggest that standards have application beyond a matter to be taken into account. (See R v Mangelsdorf (1995) 66 SASR 60 at 66.) 
      
       
     112 For those who are concerned that a guideline will, as a matter of practical reality, impermissibly confine the exercise of a discretion, no doubt the very concreteness of a numerical guideline is seen to be particularly objectionable. Differing views are held about the robustness of sentencing judges. In my opinion, a numerical indicator will not operate to confine the sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     113 However, the authorities referred to above suggest that this Court should take particular care when expressing a guideline judgment to ensure that it does not, as a matter of practical effect, impermissibly confine the exercise of discretion. This involves, in my opinion, ensuring that the observations in the original guideline judgment of Jurisic - that a guideline was only an “indicator” - must be emphasised, albeit reiterated in the language of the 2001 Act as a matter to be “taken into account”. A guideline is to be taken into account only as a “check” or “sounding board” or “guide” but not as a “rule” or “presumption”. I see this as a reaffirmation of the reasoning in Jurisic. 
      
       
     114 As mentioned above, in Henry at [31], after stating that guidelines are only an indicator, I added: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, where a guideline is not to be applied by a trial judge, this Court would expect that the reasons for that decision be articulated, so that the public interest in the perception of consistency in sentencing decisions can be served and this Court can be properly informed in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.” 
         
        
       
     115 As Simpson J pointed out in R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32 at [26], it did not follow that a failure to articulate reasons necessarily amounted to legal error. Under the new s37A, the obligation on a sentencing judge is to take a guideline into account. The obligation to give reasons is now the same as that applicable in the case of any other matter required to be taken into account. 
      
       
     116 The element of prescriptiveness, if that be appropriate terminology, of a guideline judgment given under s37A, is now provided for in the statute. The majority judgments in Wong are not directly applicable to such a guideline. 
      
       
        
       Constitutional Validity 
        
       
     117 The Senior Public Defender submitted that the guidelines issued in both Jurisic and Henry were invalid under the Commonwealth Constitution. Section 37A could not validly authorise such a guideline. Mr Haesler relied on Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 189 CLR 51. He submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The promulgation of a prescriptive guideline is an act legislative in character and inconsistent with the exercise by a Court vested with the exercise of Federal judicial power.” 
         
        
        
       And  
        
        
         
         “If a guideline is to be prescriptive and binding on future sentencing decisions, it will have a legislative character. It will, in effect, either add circumstances of aggravation (and/or mitigation) to the existing statutory provisions, fix a maximum starting point or range or some other abstract, quantitative restraint on sentencing discretion. 
         
        
        
         
         The exercise of this power is inconsistent with that exercised by a Court with the judicial power of the Commonwealth.” 
         
        
       
     118 As I will set out below, I do not understand Kable to propound a test of consistency. The reasoning in Kable requires incompatibility or repugnancy between the disputed function and the exercise of Commonwealth judicial power.  
      
       
     119 In Wong, a number of references were made to the legislative quality of guidelines. In the joint judgment, their Honours referred to the table becoming, in effect, “a rule of binding effect” and noted at [80]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fixing of such a table begins to show signs of passing from being a decision settling a question which is raised by the matter, to a decision creating a new charter by reference to which further questions are to be decided. It at least begins to pass from the judicial to the legislative.” [Citation omitted] 
         
        
       
     120 Their Honours referred to the English system of guideline judgments relied on in Jurisic, noting that England has no relevant constitutional limitation, and said at [81]-[82] that the issue had divided the Supreme Court of Canada in R v McDonnell in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The joint judgment at [82] referred to the differences in McDonnell in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the immediate focus of that debate was on the distinction between the judicial and the legislative function. The majority held that it was not for the courts to create subsets of the legislatively identified offence. The point of difference between the members of the Court turned upon the degree to which the starting point given by the court below could or should be taken as prescriptive.” 
         
        
       
     121 Kirby J referred to the constitutional arguments put to the Court, but did not find it necessary to decide the case on that basis. The submissions in Wong were directed to the limitations of the Federal jurisdiction (see at [147]). Under the subheading “A legislative function?” his Honour said at [144]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… much will depend upon the way in which ‘guidelines’, so-called, are expressed. If they were merely a ‘sounding board’ or ‘check’ against the exercise of a sentencing discretion, so as to bring greater consistency to that exercise, they would not be incompatible with the performance of judicial functions …. If, for example, the Court of Criminal Appeal had cited statistical and historical material and decisional analysis to describe relevant ranges of punishment by reference to multiple factors and what had occurred in the past, no offence to the exercise of judicial power would have been committed.” 
         
        
       
     122 Callinan J doubted, without deciding, that guidelines could be a proper exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by reason of the fact that: 
      
       
        
         
         “They appear to have about them a legislative quality, not only in form but also as they speak prospectively. Despite the qualifications that their makers express, they also do have, and in practice inevitably come to assume, in some circumstances, a prescriptive tone and operation.” (at [165]) 
         
        
       
     123 Callinan J distinguished between “guideline judgments and judgments setting forth sentencing principles” and said at [167]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… guidelines do have a legislative flavour about them, … by their very nature, they may detract from a proper consideration and application of the principles which … s16A(2) … requires be considered and applied in each case.” 
         
        
        
       Nevertheless, Callinan J indicated, albeit without deciding, that a State legislature could legislate for the promulgation of guidelines in relation to State offences, so long as they are “guidelines only … [i.e.] …indicative starting points” (see [168]). 
        
       
     124 For the reasons I have given above, the “prescriptive” quality of the guidelines in Jurisic and Henry differ from that identified in the majority judgments in Wong. The reasoning of this Court in Wong may have gone beyond the reasoning in Jurisic and Henry. In any event the form of the guideline in Wong was quite different. At least in the judgment of Kirby J, the use of guidelines as a “check” or “sounding board” is not impermissibly prescriptive. Kirby J said at [144]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fact that so many judges in different jurisdictions have sought to promote greater consistency in sentencing by the use of what have been called ‘guidelines’ is a reason for this Court to exercise caution before condemning the innovation as incompatible with judicial functions under the Australian Constitution.”  
         
        
       
     125 The joint judgment in Wong referred to the Court’s decision in Re Attorney-General’s Application (No 1): R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, in which a guideline was issued by the Court upon the Attorney’s application under the legislation in the form in which it was before the 2001 Act. Far from casting any doubt on the validity of the legislation, the joint judgment said at [60]: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was, therefore, a specific basis in State law for the application and no federal element.” 
         
        
       
     126 I have set out my own understanding of the High Court decision in Kable in John Fairfax Publications v Attorney General (NSW) (2000) 158 FLR 81 esp at [10]-[51]. In my opinion Kable is authority for the proposition that a State legislature may not invest the Supreme Court of the State with a function which is incompatible with, or repugnant to, the exercise by that Court of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. However, the four judgments of the majority in Kable are not able to be distilled into a single principle. (See R v Moffatt [1998] 2 VR 229 at 237 per Winneke P and 249 and 251 per Hayne JA.)  
      
       
     127 In Kable Gaudron J identified the function under consideration as involving “the antithesis of the judicial process” (at 106), as making “a mockery of that process” (at 108) and as being contrary “to what is ordinarily involved in the judicial process” (at 107). The power, her Honour held, compromised the “integrity” of the Supreme Court and, by reason of that Court’s role under Ch III also, therefore, compromised the integrity of the judicial system under Ch III. Her Honour said that in part “… The integrity of the courts depends on their acting in accordance with the judicial process” (at 107). 
      
       
     128 McHugh J emphasised that the power was “far removed from the judicial process that is ordinarily invoked when a court is asked to imprison a person” (at 122). His Honour also held that the statutory procedures “compromise the institutional impartiality of the Supreme Court” (at 121). 
      
       
     129 Gummow J identified the power as “repugnant to the judicial process in a fundamental degree” (at 132, see also at 134). This was an aspect of “the character or quality of the State court system” (at 139), with which Ch III was concerned.  
      
       
     130 Each of the members of the majority in Kable referred to the significance of public confidence in the administration of justice and, particularly, the appearance of impartiality and independence of the judiciary from the legislature and the executive (per Toohey J (at 98), per Gaudron J (at 107), per McHugh J (at 117, 118-119, 121 and 124) and per Gummow J (at 133-134)). 
      
       
     131 In John Fairfax Publications at [21]-[26], I referred to other authorities, particularly the observations of Brennan CJ in Nicholas v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 173, the joint judgment in Grollo v Palmer (1995) 184 CLR 348 at 365 and the joint judgment in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government & Ethnic Affairs (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 27 and 36-37. 
      
       
     132 As I have indicated, no single principle can be derived from the judgments in Kable.  The common theme is a test of incompatibility. I suggested in John Fairfax Publications (at [43]) that it may be appropriate to adopt the term “repugnancy”, to distinguish the Kable doctrine from the “incompatibility doctrine” applicable to federal courts.  
      
       
     133 State legislation must have a quite exceptional character to contravene the constitutional protection of the judicial process. This is manifest in the failure of intermediate courts of appeal to identify any such contravention in the subsequent authorities: 
      
       
     · R v Moffatt (the imposition and review of indefinite sentences). 
      
       
     · Wynbyne v Marshall (1997) 141 FLR 166, followed in R v Fittock (2001) 11 NTLR 52 (mandatory sentencing). 
      
       
     · Lloyd v Snooks (1999) 153 FLR 339 (mandatory sentencing). 
      
       
     · Felman v Law Institute (Vic) [1998] 4 VR 324 at 352-358 (supervisory jurisdiction over legal profession). 
      
       
     · Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Dawson (1999) 87 FCR 588 at 595-596 (denial of legal professional privilege). 
      
       
     · R v Nixon (2000) 119 A Crim R 477 (the court’s role in a statutory witness protection scheme). 
      
       
     · Silbert v Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) [2002] WASCA 12 (forfeiture order upon death of accused before trial – by majority). 
      
       
     · R v Baker [2002] NSWCCA 184 (redetermination of life sentence requirement of “special reasons”). 
      
       
     134 In order to render a State Supreme Court an unfit repository of federal jurisdiction it is not enough to label a function as “legislative” or “quasi-legislative”. It is necessary to look at the jurisdiction conferred by the statute and analyse the extent, nature and quality of the alleged incompatibility. 
      
       
     135 There is no doubt that some aspects of the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by the 2001 Act could not be conferred on a Ch III court. In particular that is so of the power in s37A(1) which authorises the Court to give a guideline judgment “on its own motion” and to do so in any proceedings in which the Court believes it appropriate to do so “whether or not it is necessary for the purpose of determining the proceeding”. This power extends to the giving of a guideline which a sentencing court must “take into account”. The identification of matters to be taken into account is not exclusively a legislative function.  
      
       
     136 The joint judgment in Wong refers to the function of an intermediate appellate court to formulate principles, as distinct from results. However, the formulation of principles – for example in the form of a list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the character in Attorney-General’s Application (No 1) – also identifies matters which a sentencing court should take into account. The determination of matters required to be taken into account is not necessarily the exercise of legislative power.  
      
       
     137 At the time of the adoption of the Australian Constitution, the provision of numerical guidance by judges was not regarded as a function incompatible with judicial office. In 1901, before the establishment of a court of criminal appeal, Lord Alverstone CJ and all of the judges of the Kings Bench Division (except one who was ill) formulated a “Memorandum on normal punishments in certain kinds of crime”. The issues that were addressed in this memorandum indicate that debates about leniency and consistency are not new. The memorandum said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The extent of divergence in the assessment of punishment by Judges of the High Court, sitting in Courts of criminal jurisdiction, has been much exaggerated. In almost every class of crime, and pre-eminently in the case of manslaughter, the Judge, in fixing the punishment, has to discriminate between widely different degrees of moral culpability, and to weigh an infinite variety of circumstances and situations. The Legislature has wisely provided a large latitude in punishment. Justice demands, at times, that this latitude should be boldly used; and demands constantly the use of it in a slighter degree. Any attempt to mete out punishment to offenders in the same class of crime at a rigidly uniform rate could result only in the frequent perpetration of injustice. If due allowance is made for these essential considerations, there is nothing in the sentences of Judges of the High Court of Justice which are recorded in the criminal statistics (apart from the question of the advisability of flogging as a punishment) to indicate the existence of any established difference of principle or of general practice in the sentences of Judges of the High Court of Justice. 
          
          
         At the same time, the Judges of the King’s Bench Division are agreed that it would be convenient and of public advantage in regard to certain classes of crime to come to an agreement, or, at least, to an approximate agreement, as to what may be called a ‘normal’ standard of punishment: a standard of punishment, that is to say, which should be assumed to be properly applicable, unless the particular case under consideration presented some special features of aggravation or of extenuation.” 
         
         
        
       (The Memorandum is reprinted in the Report of the Advisory Council on the Penal System,  
       Sentences of Imprisonment: A Review of Maximum Penalties,  
       London: Home Office, 1978, Appendix E, 191; and in R M Jackson,  
       Enforcing the Law 
       , Penguin Books, 1972, Appendix V, 391. The Memorandum is considered in D A Thomas,

     138 The Memorandum set out specific sentence ranges for a variety of offences and made separate provision for first offences and subsequent convictions, juveniles and adults and aggravating circumstances likely to arise for specific offences. Differences of opinion amongst the judges is referred to. For Australian constitutional purposes, it is appropriate only to observe that this collective endeavour, although not itself performed in a judicial role, was not regarded as incompatible with the judicial function in 1901. The public concern about disparity in sentences of that era, which is replicated in contemporary debate including conflict between the Home Office and the judiciary, culminated in the creation in 1907 of the first Court of Criminal Appeal. (See Radzinowicz and Hood at 753-770.) 
      
       
     139 The power in s37A is not tarnished by any suggestion of non-judicial pre-judgment, which the judicial arm of government is required to ratify, as was the case in Kable. Section 37A authorises this Court to formulate guidelines in an important area of judicial decision-making which are not prescriptive for the reasons I have given above but which, even on a more elastic understanding of the word “prescriptive”, do not lead to any pre-determined result. The prescription, if any, is the addition of a particular matter to a list of considerations required to be taken into account.  
      
       
     140 Even if it is appropriate to attach the label “legislative” or “quasi-legislative” to a power of this character, it is not , in my opinion, a power the exercise of which detracts in any way from the reputation of the Court or from the actual or perceived independence and impartiality of the Court. The Court alone makes the relevant decision. The submission that the legislation is invalid should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       The Need for a Numerical Guideline 
        
       
     141 The Senior Public Defender submitted that the Court should not give any guideline which contained a quantitative element, in large measure because a guideline in that form was prescriptive and of a legislative character. Any guideline, it was submitted, should be restricted to a list of relevant considerations of the character which this Court gave in Re Attorney-General’s Application (No 1), i.e. a judgment which brings together sentencing principles discernible in the body of relevant appellate authority.  
      
       
     142 Prior to Jurisic there were a number of decisions of this Court which had identified such principles applicable to s52A of the Crimes Act, drawing from time to time on the case law of other jurisdictions for parallel offences. However, it was apparent to this Court in Jurisic that these principles had not been applied by sentencing judges. In particular the weight to be given to the need for public deterrence and the seriousness with which the community regarded the particular offences, manifest in a substantial increase in maximum penalties, had not been reflected in a substantial number of cases. As a result there was a flow of almost invariably successful Crown appeals against sentences imposed under s52A. (See Jurisic at 229.) The large proportion of cases that did not result in a term of actual imprisonment suggested a pattern of leniency and of inconsistency on the part of sentencing judges. The numerous statements in this Court about the need for a sharp upward movement in the sentencing pattern (e.g. R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519) had been ignored by a significant number of sentencing judges. An approach limited to the identification of relevant sentencing principles had proved inadequate. 
      
       
     143 As Wood CJ at CL observed in Jurisic at 233: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Court has, in the many instances identified and in several other areas, over the years endeavoured to lay down sentencing principles for particular classes of case where sentences reflecting a significant element of general deterrence are required, or where non-custodial options are inappropriate. It appears that sometimes these principles are lost or that their significance is overlooked, in the volume of appellate decisions handed down and in the pressure imposed on trial courts to dispose of increasingly busy criminal lists.” 
         
        
       
     144 It appears that the Jurisic guideline did have the effect which this Court intended. (See Barnes, Poletti and Potas, Sentencing Dangerous Drivers in New South Wales: Impact of the Jurisic Guidelines on Sentencing Practice, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, July 2002.)  
      
       
     145 In my opinion, the numerical guideline contained in Jurisic has proven to be significant in ensuring both the adequacy of sentences and consistency in sentencing for this offence in New South Wales. If the numerical guideline were removed then the pattern of inadequacy and inconsistency would, in my opinion, quickly re-emerge. Section 52A is an offence particularly likely to be affected by personal sentencing philosophy resulting in a wide divergence of outcomes. Some sentencing judges find it very difficult to accept that a person of good character who is unlikely to re-offend should be sent to gaol. However, Parliament has made it quite clear that the injuries occasioned by driving dangerously and, no doubt, the prevalence of the offence, require condign punishment. 
      
       
     146 As I emphasised in Jurisic (e.g. at 216B-C, 220C) there is tension between maintaining the discretion essential for individualised justice, on the one hand, and guidance to ensure consistency in sentencing decisions, on the other hand. The basic principle is that of equality of justice. Like cases must be treated alike. Unlike cases must be treated differently. The first statement requires consistency. The second statement requires individualised justice. In my opinion, numerical guideline judgments have a role to play in achieving the ultimate goal of equality of justice in circumstances where, as a matter of practical reality, there is tension between the principle of individualised justice and the principle of consistency. 
      
       
        
       The Principle of Individualised Justice 
        
       
     147 The maintenance of a broad sentencing discretion is essential to ensure that all of the wide variations of circumstances of the offence and the offender are taken into account. Sentences must be individualised. The final balance of a wide variety of incommensurable and often incompatible factors does not, I accept, involve a mathematical exercise. 
      
       
     148 The joint judgment in Wong emphasised the range of considerations that are relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Their Honours stated at [76]: 
      
       
        
         
         “So long as a sentencing judge must, or may, take account of  
         all 
          of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to single out some of those considerations and attribute specific numerical or proportionate value to some features, distorts the already difficult balancing exercise which the judge must perform.” 
         
        
       
     149 The joint judgment rejected the identification by this Court of weight of narcotic as the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence as a departure from “fundamental principle” ([70]). One of the bases on which the joint judgment reached this conclusion was that it adopted an impermissible “two-stage” approach to sentencing, rather than an “instinctive synthesis” approach. (See at [74]-[78].) At [176] their Honours referred to my analysis of the authorities in this respect in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [54]-[113].  
      
       
     150 Their Honours were not intending to restrict their criticism of the two-stage approach to a table of the character involved in that case and its emphasis on the weight of narcotics. Their Honours said at [78]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Numerical guidelines either take account of only some of the relevant considerations or would have to be so complicated as to make their application difficult, if not impossible. Most importantly of all, numerical guidelines cannot address considerations of proportionality. Their application cannot avoid outcomes which fail to reflect the circumstances of the offence  
         and 
          the offender (with absurd and unforeseen results) if they do not articulate and reflect the principles which will lead to the just sentencing of offenders whose offending behaviour is every bit as diverse as is their personal history and circumstances.” [References omitted] 
         
        
       
     151 Kirby J, who had indicated his disagreement with the “instinctive synthesis” approach in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111 at [99]-[100] (and see [102]), reiterated his position in Wong at [101]-[103]. His Honour said that that was not an appropriate occasion on which to resolve the differences that had emerged. Gleeson CJ referred with implicit approval to a two-stage approach which identifies comparable sentences and proceeds to distinguish facts and circumstances of the case (see at [11]-[12]). 
      
       
     152 The reference in the joint judgment at [78], quoted above, to inconsistency between numerical guidelines and the principle of proportionality, refers to this principle as encompassing all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, considered together. That this must be the ultimate outcome can be readily accepted. However, in this State the principle of proportionality identified in Veen v The Queen (1978-1979) 143 CLR 458 esp at 490; Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 esp at 472-3, 476 has long been held to permit, indeed to require, that a sentence should be proportionate to the objective gravity of the offence. This necessarily requires a sentencing judge to consider, at some stage in the reasoning process, the sentence that is appropriate for the particular circumstances of the crime without reference to the subjective case of the particular offender. 
      
       
     153 The role of objective circumstances in the test of proportionality was emphasised in the joint judgment of the High Court in Hoare v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354: 
      
       
        
         
         “… a basic principle of sentencing law is that a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its  
         objective 
          circumstances.” [Emphasis in original] 
         
        
       
     154 The joint judgment in Hoare reiterated the reference at 356: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the basic principle that a term of imprisonment cannot properly exceed that which is justified as appropriate or proportionate punishment for the objective offence.” 
         
        
        
       (See Fox “The Meaning of Proportionality in Sentencing” (1994) 19  
       MULR 
        489 esp at 494-495.) 
        
       
     155 In Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 535-536 the High Court in a joint judgment of Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ left open the question of whether the Veen cases approved a “two step approach”.  
      
       
     156 The reasoning in Hoare appears to me to necessarily involve separate consideration of the sentence appropriate to the objective circumstances of the offence. Although expressed as an upper limit – a sentence cannot be greater than the objective circumstance suggest – it has been applied to create a lower limit – a sentence should not be less than the objective circumstances require.  
      
       
     157 In R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 in a joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J, their Honours said at 354: 
      
       
        
         
         “… there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as  
         Veen (No 2) 
          (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity …” 
         
        
       
     158 Dodd has been followed and applied in this Court on numerous occasions. (See e.g. R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at [70]; R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [31]; R v Ramos (2000) 112 A Crim R 339 at [12]; R v PG (2001) 122 A Crim R 529 at [19]-[20]; R v Sloane [2001] NSWCCA 421 at [30]-[31]; R v Edigarov  [2001] NSWCCA 436 at [54]; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [9]-[10].) (See also Gleeson “Individualised Justice – The Holy Grail” (1995) 69 ALJ 421 at 424; R v Ireland (1987) 29 A Crim R 353 at 366; Punch v The Queen (1993) 9 WAR 486 at 503 per Anderson J; R v Raggett (1990) 101 FLR 323 at 334; and Khouzame v The Queen [2001] FCA 354 at [23].) 
      
       
     159 If this represents a “two stage approach” inconsistent with the “instinctive synthesis” approach adopted by the Victorian Supreme Court (see R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 esp at 300; R v Young  [1990] VR 951 at 954-961), then this Court should leave it to the High Court to resolve the issue.  
      
       
     160 There is much to be said for the proposition that the sequence in which objective circumstances and subjective considerations are taken into account should not matter, as long as all relevant considerations are taken into account. (See e.g. Punch v The Queen; R v Mulholland (1995) 102 FLR 465 at 479-480 per Angel J.) 
      
       
     161 As Angel J put it in R v Mulholland at 480, a two stage approach only involves ‘a pause along the way’ and is likely to lead to the same or similar result. The difference may be, as Kirby J has said, “one of semantics rather than of substance”. (Cameron v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382 at [71].) 
      
       
     162 This approach may not differ in practice from that envisaged by McHugh J in AB v The Queen in which his Honour criticised the two stage approach to sentencing. McHugh J said at [18]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The task of the sentencing judge or magistrate is not to add and subtract from an objectively determined sentence but to balance the various factors and make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case …  
         No doubt at the conclusion of the process, the judge will check the sentence against other comparable sentences and may feel compelled to adjust the sentence up or down. 
          But that is quite different from beginning with an ‘objectively’ determined sentence.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     163 On this basis, the use of a guideline judgment as a ‘check’ or ‘guide’ or ‘indicator’ is a “two stage” approach that is consistent with the ultimate application of an “instinctive synthesis” approach. Indeed, Crockett J one of the co-authors of the judgment in Williscroft, emphasised in another case the necessity to have regard to prior sentences as a “guide” or a “yardstick”. (See R v Zakaria (1984) 12 A Crim R 386 at 388.) 
      
       
     164 I do not see any necessary inconsistency. The crucial sentence in Williscroft at 300 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now,  
         ultimately 
          every sentence imposed represents the sentencing judge’s instinctive synthesis of all the various aspects involved in the punitive process.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     165 In order to ensure that “ultimately” there is such an instinctive synthesis in the determination of the sentence actually imposed, it is not impermissible for a sentencing judge, as part of the reasoning, or as a final adjustment or check, to give a significant, severable part of the relevant considerations, separate numerical weight. As Gleeson said in Wong at [12]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Judges are generally capable of entertaining two or more ideas at the one time.” 
         
        
       
     166 Nor, in my opinion, is it impermissible for a sentencing judge to take into account, as a guide or check or indicator, what an appellate court has said would be an appropriate sentence in a typical case. 
      
       
     167 Individualised justice is not, in my opinion, incompatible with guidance of a numerical character from an appellate court, so long as two conditions are met. First, the guidance is not prescriptive in the sense that a guideline is a matter to be taken into account. Secondly, the sentencing judge must be able to determine the actual decision on the basis of a final balancing exercise, or “instinctive synthesis”, which is not capable of precise articulation. In my opinion, numerical guideline judgments can satisfy these two conditions. 
      
       
        
       The Principle of Consistency 
        
       
     168 The significance of sentencing consistency has been frequently emphasised (sometimes in terms of “disparity” or “uniformity” or “discrepancy”). (See, for example, Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610; Griffiths v The Queen (1976-1977) 137 CLR 293 at 326-327; Bugmy v The Queen at 538;  Everett v The Queen  (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 306; Dinsdale v The Queen  (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 340.) 
      
       
     169 As Gleeson CJ said in Wong at [6]: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “One of the legitimate objectives of such guidance [described by the expression ‘guidelines’ and ‘guidelines judgments’] is to reduce the incidence of unnecessary and inappropriate inconsistency. All discretionary decision-making carries with it the probability of some degree of inconsistency. But there are limits beyond which such inconsistency itself constitutes a form of injustice. The outcome of discretionary decision-making can never be uniform, but it ought to depend as little as possible upon the identity of the judge who happens to hear the case. Like cases should be treated in like manner. The administration of criminal justice works as a system; not merely as a multiplicity of unconnected single instances. It should be systematically fair, and that involves, amongst other things, reasonable consistency.” 
         
        
       
     170 As Jacobs J pointed out in Griffiths v The Queen at 327: 
      
       
        
         
         “… where equal treatment (i.e. consistency in sentencing) is not the rule a potential offender is encouraged to play the odds, believing that he will be among those who escape serious sanctions. Certainty of punishment is more important than increasingly heavy punishment.” 
         
        
       
     171 Priestley JA outlined the compatibility of a final instinctive synthesis with the recognition of the need for consistency in sentencing in R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 270: 
      
       
        
         
         “The various elements which a sentencing judge must take into account in arriving at his sentence are, in my respectful opinion, well described in  
         R v Williscroft 
          [1975] VR 292. A feature of the discussion in that case is its recognition that ‘ultimately every sentence imposed represents the sentencing judge’s instinctive synthesis of all the various aspects involved in the punitive process’ (at 300). The reported decisions show a constant effort by the courts to reduce the sentencing process to a reasonable degree of regularity and order and to eliminate so far as possible the idiosyncrasies of individual judges in arriving at the ‘instinctive synthesis’ spoken of in  
         R v Williscroft 
         . What is to me a very instructive example of this search for reasoned orderliness is the recent decision of this Court in  
         R v Visconti 
          [1982] 2 NSWLR 104. This decision discussed in detail the desirability of even-handedness in sentencing. To obtain a reasonable degree of even-handedness involves the sentencing court in being aware of the general pattern of sentencing in respect of particular types of crime. The pattern, once ascertained, will indicate to a court in a particular case a range within which the sentence should fall, bearing in mind the various factors which the court must consider.” 
         
        
       
     172 The use of an existing sentencing pattern in this way is, in my opinion, compatible with the final decision, in a particular case, being characterised as an ‘instinctive synthesis’. A guideline judgment is no different to a sentencing pattern in this regard. 
      
       
     173 In Wong, Gleeson CJ at [11] quoted McLachlin J from McDonnell at 989 where her Ladyship said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The starting-point approach was developed as a way of incorporating into the sentencing process the dual perspectives of the seriousness of the offence and the need to consider the individual circumstances of the offender. It represents a restatement of the long-standing practice of sentencing judges of beginning by considering the range of sentence that has been posed for similar criminal acts followed by consideration of factors peculiar to the case and offender before them.” 
         
        
       
     174 Gleeson CJ observed at [12]: 
      
       
        
         
         “This does not have to be taken as referring to a strictly sequential process of reasoning.” 
         
        
       
     175 I do not think it has ever been doubted that it is material for a sentencing judge to take into account an existing pattern of sentencing. In Wong, this Court purported to state an existing pattern of sentencing in a particular manner. Criticisms of this Court’s judgment in the High Court were related to the manner in which that pattern was stated. No criticism was directed to the foundational assumption of this Court’s reasoning in Wong, including this Court’s considerations of prior decisions in which a dispute had arisen as to what that pattern of sentencing revealed, that such a pattern constituted a relevant consideration. 
      
       
     176 In Wong the joint judgment referred to the ground of manifest excess or manifest inadequacy, as a basis for appeal from a discretionary judgment, and said at [58]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this … kind of case appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases.” 
         
        
       
     177 Their Honours referred to the well known reasoning in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. It may be accepted that the mere fact of a ‘marked difference’ is not itself suggestive of legal error. However a failure to take into account a material consideration is identified as error in House v The King. 
      
       
     178 The obligation to take into account an existing pattern of sentencing reflects the principle of equality which requires consistency in outcomes, so that like cases are in fact treated alike and can be seen to have been so treated.  
      
       
     179 A pattern of sentencing emerges over a period of time by the conduct of sentencing judges and, of course, by courts of criminal appeal, which frequently are called upon to re-sentence. A pattern of sentencing emerges and changes over time from the ostensibly unrelated decisions of numerous sentencing judges. A pattern emerges, from the bottom up as it were, which is often supported as a manifestation of the collective wisdom of judges in an essentially uncoordinated process. 
      
       
     180 The end result may be that described by Lord Tennyson in Aylmer’s Field: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the lawless science of our law, 
          
         That codeless myriad of precedent,  
          
         That wilderness of single instances,...” 
         
        
       
     181 To some degree the “wilderness” is tamed by intermediate courts of appeal establishing principles. It is also generally accepted that an intermediate court of appeal may control the boundaries of acceptable results by determining what is manifestly inadequate and what is manifestly excessive. The issue is whether or not it is permissible for a court of criminal appeal to give guidance as to the appropriate level of sentences within these boundaries. Specifically, as was the case in Jurisic, whether it is permissible for a court of criminal appeal to determine that an existing pattern of sentences should move upwards, and to do so not only by asserting that objective in terms, as this Court has done with respect to this offence on a number of occasions without effect, but to identify appropriate sentences. 
      
       
     182 In my opinion, an intermediate court of appeal ought be able to give guidelines with respect to the exercise of a discretion, such as the sentencing discretion, that identify an appropriate level in a numerical way, at the least if such a guideline is not more prescriptive than establishing an obligation upon the judge exercising the discretion to take the guideline into account. 
      
       
     183 In this regard I believe courts of criminal appeal have certain advantages which do not exist for first instance judges. First, an appellate court has an overview of remarks on sentence by a range of judges. Such are theoretically available to trial judges, but such remarks are required to be read and assessed, and are in fact read and assessed, on a systematic basis by judges who sit on appeals. Secondly, perhaps more significantly, a multi-judge bench must engage in a process of dialogue about the appropriate level of sentence that is more likely to lead to a result that takes a variety of considerations into account, and is unaffected by the idiosyncratic personal philosophy of an individual judge. The process of dialogue amongst members of an appellate court changes the quality of the decision-making process. Whilst sentencing judges at first instance may engage in discussions with colleagues, the requirement of dialogue imposed on a multi-member appellate bench before reaching a decision is of a different character. 
      
       
     184 As the experience of this Court with respect to sentencing for s52A prior to Jurisic shows, the mechanisms for ensuring consistency in the absence of guideline judgments may prove to be defective. This is, in part, a reflection of the restrictions applicable to Crown appeals which do not apply to severity appeals.  
      
       
     185 The normal appellate process is not always able to ensure consistency in results in the sense that similar cases are treated similarly. The words of the statutory provisions establishing a right of appeal by the Crown against inadequacy of sentence have been interpreted by the courts to be subject to a number of restrictions. These restrictions include observations that such appeals should be rare. Furthermore, the determination of Crown appeals are subject to what has been described, not particularly accurately, as “the principle of double jeopardy”. No such restrictions are imposed on severity appeals. The result is sometimes an imbalance in the outcomes of the appellate process. Guidance by an appellate court of a numerical character is at least capable of minimising such inconsistency. 
      
       
     186 Inconsistency is also a function of the size of the criminal justice system. If the frequently stated assertion of the importance of consistency is to rise above the level of empty rhetoric, something more than the system of Crown appeals has been shown to be required. 
      
       
     187 The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal now deals with something in the order of 1,000 cases a year. Many sentencing appeals are dealt with by two judge benches in accordance with the provisions of s6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Some forty separate judges sit in this Court in any one year. The maintenance of consistency becomes progressively more difficult.  
      
       
     188 Gleeson CJ identified the difficulties of scale associated with the criminal justice system in Wong at [10]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The increasing size of the judiciary, and the legal profession, is a factor in the importance which is attached to the problem of inconsistency, and the need for appellate guidance. In the days when criminal justice was administered by a relatively small group of judges, it was easier to maintain consistency. The range of likely penalties for common offences was well known, and significant departures from that range were readily identified. Idiosyncratic decision-making was not difficult to recognise. Now, at least in New South Wales, a large number of judges (and acting judges) sentence offenders, and there is a growing need for the Court of Criminal Appeal to give practical guidance to primary judges. The form that such guidance might properly take is an important issue in the administration of criminal justice. If there is insufficient guidance, and resulting inconsistency, public confidence in the value of discretionary sentencing will suffer.” 
         
        
       
     189 It is the very concreteness of a numerical guideline, which may create tension with the principle of individualised justice, that can, as a matter of practical reality, help to avoid impermissible inconsistency. 
      
       
        
       Public Confidence 
        
       
     190 Nothing is more corrosive of public confidence in the administration of justice than the belief that criminal sentencing is primarily determined by which judge happens to hear the case. Public confidence in the administration of justice, as Gummow J pointed out in Mann v O’Neill (1996-1997) 191 CLR 204 at 245, is today the meaning of the ancient phrase “the majesty of the law”. Such confidence is to a very substantial extent determined by public understanding of sentencing by criminal courts. Whether described in terms of transparency or accountability, public understanding is enhanced by clarity in the identification of the factors taken into consideration in determining the sentence imposed in a particular case. Today the public is less prone than it may once have been to accept a judge’s “instincts” – or indeed those of other authority figures – as determinative. Public confidence would be enhanced, in my opinion, if the specific weight given to particular factors is apparent from reasons for decision. A starting point or range derived from a guideline judgment, as a check or guide or indicator, will assist in clarifying the process of reasoning. 
      
       
     191 As Kirby J said in Wong at [102]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Recent decisions of this Court have been interpreted, correctly in my opinion, as requiring greater disclosure by sentencing judges of the way in which they actually arrive at the sentence imposed on a person convicted of an offence. The final sentence will normally include elements of judgment and intuition. But in my view, it cannot be denied that adjustments are made to a prima facie level with which the sentencing judge begins the task. How can one even begin to think of ‘discounts’, for example, without at least conceiving the integer which is the subject of the discount? The ultimate product is no more scientifically demonstrable than a judgment for damages for personal injuries. But it would be a retrograde step to subsume the adjustments which the law requires to be taken into account in sentencing by a ‘return to unexplained judicial intuition’. Greater transparency and honesty are the hallmarks of modern public administration and the administration of justice. In sentencing, we should not turn our backs on these advances.” (Footnotes omitted.) 
         
        
       
     192 Kirby J returned to this theme in Cameron at [73]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the context of the higher duty of judges to state reasons that facilitate the judicial process, considerations important to judicial orders should … be revealed for the scrutiny of the litigants, the public and the appellate process. They should not be hidden in judicial formulae about ‘instinct’.” (Footnote omitted.) 
         
        
       
     193 As I said in Jurisic at 220: 
      
       
        
         
         “At times, and with respect to particular offences, it will be appropriate for this Court to lay down guidelines so as to reinforce public confidence in the integrity of the process of sentencing. Guideline judgments, formally so labelled, may assist in diverting unjustifiable criticism of the sentences imposed in particular cases, or by particular judges. 
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion, guideline judgments should now be recognised in New South Wales as having a useful role to play in ensuring that an appropriate balance exists between the broad discretion that must be retained to ensure that justice is done in each individual case, on the one hand, and the desirability of consistency in sentencing and the maintenance of public confidence in sentences actually imposed, and in the judiciary as a whole, on the other.” 
         
        
        
       Review of the  
       Jurisic  
       Guideline 
        
       
     194 Section 37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as inserted by the 2001 Act, empowers this Court to give a guideline judgment on its own motion “in any proceedings considered appropriate by the Court”. In my opinion, for the reasons given above, it is “appropriate” to give a guideline judgment with respect to s52A of the Crimes Act 1900 in the present proceedings. It is not necessary to decide whether the guideline for this offence contained in Jurisic was valid, nor, if not originally valid, whether it was validated by the retrospective provisions of the 2001 Act. 
      
       
     195 The majority judgment in Wong cast doubt on the use to which sentencing judges could put the Jurisic guideline (and for similar reasons the Henry guideline) in respects not clarified by s37A. In particular, it is desirable to clarify the degree of ‘prescription’, or rather lack thereof, in that guideline. By invoking s37A to give a guideline to replace the Jurisic guideline, the force of the guideline will now be stated in statutory terms as a guide which must be taken into account. 
      
       
     196 Furthermore, this Court should, in my opinion, amend some of the terminology of the Jurisic guideline which may suggest a degree of prescription beyond its use as an “indicator”, as originally stated in Jurisic. 
      
       
     197 Finally, it is desirable to state more fully the particular case to which the numerical guideline applies, in a form similar to the Henry guideline. 
      
       
     198 The joint judgment in Wong identified the limited bases upon which an appellate court may interfere with the exercise of a discretion and said at [58]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… for a court to state what  
         should 
          be the range within which some or all future exercises of discretion should fall, must carry with it a set of implicit or explicit assumptions about what is, or should be regarded as, the kind of case which would justify a sentence within the specified range. It is those assumptions that may reflect or embody the relevant principle, not the result.” 
         
        
       
     199 In this regard, the table in Wong, based only on quantity, differs from the form of guideline identified in both Jurisic and Henry, where the “assumptions about what is, or should be regarded as, the kind of case which would justify a sentence within the specified range” are stated by reference to a wide range of considerations of a frequently recurring kind.  
      
       
     200 The table in Wong provided numerical guidance for all relevant offenders. The numerical guidance in Jurisic and Henry related to cases with particular identified characteristics. The guideline in Henry is, however, more clearly of this character. 
      
       
     201 In my opinion, the Court of Criminal Appeal may give a numerical guideline where the judgment indicates with sufficient detail the kind of case for which that guideline is regarded as appropriate. It is that detail which, to adopt the words of the joint judgment quoted three paragraphs above, ‘reflects or embodies’ the relevant principles. 
      
       
     202 In Mallet, where the High Court rejected a presumption of equal division of property in matrimonial proceedings, their Honours did identify particular kinds of cases in which equality would be appropriate. (See e.g. Dawson J at 646-647.) With respect to certain identified cases, Deane J said at 640.9: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the notion of equality is likely to offer an acceptable and useful starting point…” 
         
        
       
     203 In McDonnell, McLachlin J said that the starting point approach is based on identifying a “typical case”. (See at [58], [59], [61], [85], [86].) The guideline in Henry was of this character (see at [162]). The guideline in Jurisic was also of this character, although less clearly so. Under the new statutory basis for guideline judgments, sentencing judges must take guidelines into account. It appears to me to be desirable to reformulate the Jurisic guideline in order to ensure that the guidance is stated in a form that is not impermissibly prescriptive. 
      
       
     204 A frequently recurring case of an offence under s52A has the following characteristics. 
      
       
        
         
         (i) Young offender. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
         
        
       
     (iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
      
       
     (iv) The victim is a stranger. 
      
       
     (v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates. 
      
       
     (vi) Genuine remorse. 
      
       
        
         
         (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
         
        
       
     205 As the Parliament has made clear, in the maximum penalties for the offence, conduct which causes death or grievous bodily harm, even in the absence of any intention to cause such injury, is to be regarded as a serious crime. However, in determining the appropriateness of full time custody and the length thereof, the sentencing judge must give close attention to the degree of moral culpability involved. This is a critical component of the objective circumstances of the offence. 
      
       
        
       Custodial Sentence 
        
       
     206 The guideline set out in Jurisic consisted of two distinct propositions. The first limb of the guideline was in the following terms (at 231E): 
      
       
        
         
         “A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment.” 
         
        
       
     207 In Jurisic at 217-219, I referred to numerous prior decisions of this Court which contained guidelines of this general character. In the case of eight different offences, there were observations to the effect that a custodial sentence was required, save in exceptional circumstances. In the case of fourteen other offences, there were observations to the effect that a substantial period of imprisonment was ordinarily required. 
      
       
     208 The joint judgment in Wong at [61]-[62] expressly approved the form that “guidance” took in the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Police v Cadd. That guidance was at 171: 
      
       
        
         
         “…that the punishment should be imprisonment ‘in the ordinary case of contumacious offending by a first offender, but the circumstances of the offending or the offender may dictate some less severe form of punishment…’” 
         
        
       
     209 The joint judgment in Wong at [62] paraphrased this passage in the formulation “the punishment should be imprisonment in the ordinary case of contumacious offending”. Their Honours noted that the “real content of the guidance” was in the reasons, where meaning was given to the word “ordinary” in the expression “ordinary case of contumacious offending”. In the Addendum in Police v Cadd, it was stated that the explanation of this phrase was to be found in the judgment of Mullighan J. Mullighan J explained his use of the word “contumacious” at 179: 
      
       
        
         
         “It means something more than mere intention to drive disqualified which is an essential element of the charge. It is committing the offence with an attitude of total disregard of the disqualification in disobedience to the authority which imposed it.” 
         
        
       
     210 The two other members of the majority would have gone further than Mullighan J. Doyle CJ contended that the offence there under consideration would “ordinarily” warrant imprisonment and that a suspension of such a sentence would be “unusual” (see at 166.5, 167.8 and 168.7). Bleby J formulated the guidance in terms of imprisonment as being “appropriate” for what Mullighan J described as a “contumacious offender … in most cases … unless quite extraordinary personal or other circumstances demand otherwise” (at 209.3). 
      
       
     211 The approval by the joint judgment in Wong of the common ground formulation of the majority in Cadd, and the reasons given therefore, do suggest an implicit disapproval of the further formulations of Doyle CJ and Bleby J. The latter are similar to the first limb of the Jurisic guideline. I do not understand Kirby J to have agreed with the joint judgment in this regard. As I have shown in Jurisic, guidance in this form has been given on numerous occasions by this Court. The position in New South Wales is, in any event, now affected by statute. 
      
       
     212 A guideline under s37A is a matter to be taken into account. The first limb of the Jurisic guideline, with the terminology “should be” and “almost invariably confined to”, has a more prescriptive tone than that which is suggested by the statutory formulation. In view of the apprehension about the practical effect of a guideline, to which I have referred above, it is appropriate to reformulate the guideline. 
      
       
     213 Since the decision of this Court in Jurisic the Parliament has enacted s5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “5(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.” 
         
        
        
       This statutory directive requires an amendment to the first limb of the  
       Jurisic  
       guideline. 
        
       
     214 The guideline this Court should give pursuant to s37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with respect to the typical case identified above is: 
      
       
        
         
         A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
         
        
        
        
        
       The Numerical Guideline 
        
       
     215 The second limb of the guideline in Jurisic at 231 was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.” 
         
        
       
     216 I had earlier set out a list of aggravating factors which had been established in the authorities as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Degree of speed. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) Erratic driving. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
         
        
        
         
         (viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
         
        
        
         
         (ix) Escaping police pursuit.” 
         
        
       
     217 Further consideration of the authorities would cause me to amend this list by changing (v) to read “erratic or aggressive driving” and adding: 
      
       
     (x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
      
       
     (xi) Failing to stop. 
      
       
     218 I went on to say at 231: 
      
       
        
         
         “Paragraph (i) and par (ii) focus on the occurrence, whereas pars (iii)-(ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence.” 
         
        
       
     219 It was after this passage that the two limbs of the guideline in Jurisic were set out.  
      
       
     220 I said at 231 that the formulation of whether “the relevant aggravating factor manifest[s] in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct” involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ.  
      
       
     221 I also said at 231: 
      
       
        
         
         “The period of three or two years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence.” 
         
        
       
     222 As indicated above, Kirby J’s reasoning in Wong turned in part on the impermissibility of judicial creation of a subcategory or subset of an offence defined by statute. Also as indicated above, the joint judgment made comments critical of such conduct, but its reasoning did not turn on this proposition. The statutory power to give guidelines now vested in the Court by s37A should not be exercised in such a way that the guideline can be categorised as a “subcategory” or “subset” of an offence defined by statute. It was submitted that the Jurisic guideline was of this character because of the reference to “abandonment of responsibility”. 
      
       
     223 As set out above, the guideline in Jurisic was expressed in terms of an aggravating factor involving the offender’s conduct being present “to a material degree”. The factors identified all related to the moral culpability of the offender. The reference to ‘abandonment of responsibility’ was one formulation for describing a high degree of moral culpability. The case law subsequent to Jurisic does not suggest that it has been applied as if it were a statutory test. 
      
       
     224 The joint judgment in Wong referred with approval at [61]-[62] to the judgment in Cadd which identified a relevant differentiating factor for sentencing purposes to be “the ordinary case of contumacious offending”, as explained in the judgment of Mullighan J. This appears to me to perform a similar function to the formulation “abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct” in Jurisic. 
      
       
     225 I should note that no issue of quantum arose in Cadd. This is understandable as the maximum sentence for the offence with which the Court was there concerned was only six months imprisonment. 
      
       
     226 In Wong, the “subset” or “subcategory” point arose in the context of considering the Canadian case of McDonnell, in which the majority identified the references in prior Canadian intermediate appellate decisions to “major sexual assault” as such a category. It is desirable to reformulate the Jurisic guideline to ensure that it does not suffer from the same inadequacy and is more clearly of the character of “contumacious offending” referred to in Cadd. 
      
       
     227 Furthermore, the terminology of the second limb of the Jurisic guideline may be seen to have an undesirably prescriptive tone, notwithstanding the express observations that it was not to be prescriptive. Again a reformulation is suggested. 
      
       
     228 In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii)-(xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion. 
      
       
     229 The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 
      
       
        
         
         Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. 
         
        
       
     230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 
      
       
     231 In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s52A, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment. 
      
       
     232 The guideline is, to reiterate, a “guide” or a “check”. The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
      
       
     233 This guideline focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender also require consideration. For the reasons I have given above, when discussing the proportionality cases, particularly Dodd, this approach reflects the principle of proportionality as discussed in those cases. No submission was made to this Court that the new s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act inserted by the 2002 Act, affects this line of authority. 
      
       
     234 Insofar as this guideline involves a “two step” approach to sentencing it is, in my opinion, as a “check” for the reasons given above, consistent with an ultimate decision that involves the exercise of a broad discretion, sometimes referred to as an instinctive synthesis. 
      
       
        
       Circumstances of the Case 
        
       
     235 On the evening of 8 April 2000 the Respondent was driving a motor vehicle in a southerly direction through the township of Aberdeen, along a section of the New England Highway known as MacQueen Street. At about 6.10pm his vehicle crossed to the incorrect side of the road whilst negotiating a moderate right hand bend. The vehicle collided with two other vehicles, a Chrysler Galant sedan driven by Lindsay Keys and a mini-bus driven by Robert Lawford. 
      
       
     236 The breath analysis of the Respondent in Muswellbrook Police Station had a positive reading. The evidence before the Court was that the Respondent’s blood alcohol at the time of impact would have been in the range of 0.204 grams to 0.257 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, the most likely level being 0.241. The prescribed concentration of alcohol for purposes of constituting the aggravated version of the offence under s52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 was 0.15 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. The expert evidence before the Court was that even at the lowest level of the estimated range, the Respondent’s driving would have been grossly impaired. Most persons would be in a comatose or stuporous condition with a blood alcohol reading of that level. The evidence was that only a very regular heavy drinker would be capable of walking and driving with such a high blood alcohol level, but that even such an individual would be very significantly impaired. 
      
       
     237 The Respondent had told police that he had commenced drinking at about 11.00am and consumed his last drink at about 5.00pm at a Murrurundi Hotel. The distance from Murrurundi to Aberdeen is approximately fifty kilometres.  
      
       
     238 In the record of interview the Respondent indicated that he had consumed probably about twenty schooners on the evening prior to the day of the collision and another dozen schooners on the day of the collision. The Respondent indicated that he had been feeling very tired. The Respondent was unable to recall the circumstances in which the accident occurred. Mr Keys gave evidence that he saw the Respondent’s vehicle travelling in a straight line and drifting to the right. The trial judge concluded the Respondent had fallen asleep before the collision. 
      
       
     239 The result of the collision was that there was very serious injury to a Charles Hague, then aged sixty-three, a passenger in the mini-bus. He had a fracture dislocation to the left hip, multiple lacerations and abrasions to the lower leg and a fracture of the lateral tibial plateau. He needed a total hip replacement and suffers a permanent disability with respect to his left lower limb. The sentencing judge identified the extent of injuries as “substantial” and described the effect on the victim as a ‘serious adverse impact’. 
      
       
     240 The sentencing judge recited the expert evidence about the Respondent’s physical condition. One report indicated that the prisoner may have a sleep abnormality. Another report by a consultant physician referred to a history of excessive sleepiness and came to the conclusion that the Respondent does suffer from narcolepsy and possibly a mild sleep apnoea. The report noted that sleep disorder is severely aggravated by alcohol. The trial judge concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have no doubt that the large amount of alcohol the prisoner had consumed was the principal reason the prisoner fell asleep whilst driving his vehicle. The prisoner was, whilst driving his vehicle, intoxicated to a high degree. His ability to drive the vehicle was very significantly impaired.  
         
        
        
         
         I accept, on the probabilities, that the prisoner was prone to narcolepsy prior to the offence. The fact that he was is not a matter of mitigation in the present circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The factors present: drowsiness, fatigue, history of excessive sleepiness, and the large amount of alcohol consumed, were a dangerous combination. The prisoner should not have driven his vehicle. However, he chose, for his own reasons to do so. In his own words he took a calculated risk.” 
         
        
       
     241 The sentencing judge noted the prisoner’s history. He had been convicted of a charge of common assault and a mid-range prescribed concentration alcohol offence which involved an accident. His Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
         “The prisoner’s record does not entitle him to leniency.” 
         
        
       
     242 The sentencing judge also noted the guilty plea on the second day of the trial which, he said, arose: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … from a recognition of an inevitable adverse finding by the jury. The prisoner’s plea of guilty however saved the cost of the trial proceeding further. The utilitarian benefit of the plea entitles the prisoner to a discount on sentence of 10 per cent.” 
         
        
       
     243 The sentencing judge also noted and accepted as genuine the Respondent’s expressions of remorse. 
      
       
     244 The sentencing judge took into account a range of subjective features including those set out in a psychologist’s report. Although the seriousness of the Respondent’s drinking problem was apparent, he acknowledged that he had not altered his drinking habits since the accident. His Honour specifically accepted the psychologist’s conclusion that the Respondent remains at risk primarily because of the drinking culture of the country town in which he lives. 
      
       
     245 There was a significant body of evidence of good character from the Respondent’s work and from social associates. 
      
       
     246 The sentencing judge referred to the list of considerations set out in Jurisic at 231, noting the serious nature of the injuries to Mr Hague, the number of people put at risk by the prisoner’s driving, the high degree of intoxication, the fact that he had driven for some fifty kilometres on a major roadway upon which significant traffic could be expected. His Honour also made reference to the High Court judgment in Wong, specifically to the three judge joint judgment at pars [76]-[78], and set out the effect of that judgment. His Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         “…in sentencing the prisoner I have taken into account all the circumstances of the offence and of the prisoner.” 
         
        
       
     247 His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Each case I am aware depends upon its own circumstances. The circumstances of the offence lead me to conclude, however, that in driving his motor vehicle, the prisoner abandoned the responsibility to drive safely which he owed to other road users and to himself. This is not a case of a momentary or casual lapse of attention. There is no alternative but to sentence the prisoner to a term of full-time imprisonment.” 
         
        
       
     248 It is apparent from his Honour’s reasons that he did not regard the guideline in Jurisic as prescriptive. He treated it as a guide or check. 
      
       
     249 As noted above, His Honour imposed a head sentence of two years and three months with a non-parole period of twelve months. The finding of special circumstances was based on the need for a lengthy period of supervision to assist with the Respondent’s excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no challenge to this finding. 
      
       
     250 The Crown submitted that the sentence, especially the non-parole period, was manifestly inadequate. It noted that this case involved the aggravated version of the offence, by reason of the high blood alcohol concentration. It submitted that the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
      
       
     251 The Crown referred to a number of allegedly comparable cases in which substantially higher sentences had been imposed: R v McAskill (2001) 31 MVR 508; R v Khan [2000] NSWCCA 454; R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268 and R v Bicheno [1999] NSWCCA 148. However, as Mr Thraves, who appeared for the Respondent, submitted, the cases relied on by the Crown involved significantly worse injuries to victims than that in the present case (e.g. multiple victims, amputation and blinding). 
      
       
     252 Mr Thraves submitted that the sentencing judge had taken into account all relevant considerations, including the objective gravity of the offence. He submitted that the long period on parole was required in order to provide assistance to overcome the Respondent’s drinking problem. 
      
       
     253 The present case features two offsetting considerations. The injuries caused to the victim are serious but not of so high a degree as has often featured in such cases, e.g. amputation, blinding, multiple victims. On the other hand, the moral culpability of the offender was of a very high order. A long period of binge drinking and significant sleep deprivation was not, as the trial judge found, mitigated by susceptibility to narcolepsy. 
      
       
     254 But for one circumstance, I would have found the sentence, particularly the non-parole period, to have been manifestly inadequate. The circumstance is the delay that has been occasioned by reason of this case becoming, in effect, a test case with respect to guideline judgments. 
      
       
     255 The sentence was imposed on 30 November 2001. The notice of appeal was not filed for two months. Listing for hearing was delayed to a time convenient for a number of different counsel in the cases to be listed together. The complexity of the issues has meant a significant delay in the delivery of judgment which would, in the ordinary course, have been delivered ex tempore. In the result, the Respondent has only a few months left of his non-parole period. 
      
       
     256 In all the circumstances, in my opinion, the Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     257 MASON P: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     258 I also agree with the additional remarks of McClellan J, to which I would add reference to my own comments about the analogous difficulties experienced by inexperienced trial and appellate judges so long as Planet Fisheries Pty Ltd v La Rosa (1968) 119 CLR 118 remains (see Hunter Area Health Service v Marchlewski (2000) 51 NSWLR 268 at 281, Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Sydney v Hogan (2001) 53 NSWLR 343 at 351-2). 
      
       
     259 BARR J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     260 BELL J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
      
       
     261 McCLELLAN J: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by Spigelman CJ, with which I agree. However, there are some remarks which I wish to add, not because of their novelty, but because of the significance of the issues to an understanding of the contribution which guideline judgments can make to the administration of criminal law. 
      
       
     262 It is often believed that controversy with respect to the appropriate sentence for a particular offence is a recent phenomenon, fuelled by exchanges in the electronic media and strident headlines in the popular press. Although the mechanisms for the expression of public dissatisfaction with individual sentences or sentencing patterns may have changed in recent years, the potential for controversy has, as the Chief Justice observes, existed for many years. The need perceived by the judges of the Kings Bench in 1901 to formulate a statement of “normal punishments” makes this plain. (see R M Jackson, Enforcing the Law, Penguin Books, 1972, Appendix V, 391). 
      
       
     263 Any judge who has been required to sentence a person for committing a crime, will be aware of the significant burdens which the making of the decision imposes. An experienced judge, particularly one with access to colleagues constantly involved in the sentencing process and the benefit of exchanges in an appellate court, may find the task less burdensome. However, many sentences must be imposed by judges with less experience and the majority of sentencing judges will never be involved in sentence appeals. 
      
       
     264 The structure of the modern legal profession, which demands specialisation by practitioners in particular areas of the law, will have the effect that a person who is, without doubt, appropriate for judicial appointment, may not have any, or significant experience, in the sentencing process. Even when a new judge has gained the necessary experience, the task of sentencing by the process often referred to as “instinctive synthesis”, has in recent years become more difficult and prone to miscarry. It was, I apprehend, for this reason, amongst others, that guideline judgments were initiated. (see R v Jurisic). 
      
       
     265 The sentencing process involves a balancing of many factors derived from considerations of the circumstances of the crime, the victim and the offender. If the sentence imposed is to be accepted as just, it must be consistent with sentences imposed on other offenders where the relevant factors are similar. (see Gleeson CJ in Wong at para 6). 
      
       
     266 The increasing number of sentences which are imposed and, as the Chief Justice has pointed out, the great many appeals in relation to sentences, has meant that the ideal of the individual sentencing judge being abreast of all of the sentences which are being imposed, is impossible. Even keeping abreast of the decisions of this Court is immensely difficult. The task is more difficult for the judge who has, as yet, limited experience in the sentencing process. 
      
       
     267 There are many areas in which the general community interacts with the judicial process and the judges who administer it. Public acceptance of the role of the judiciary in the making of decisions, which affect members of the community, emanates from a fundamental belief that the decisions which are made, provide a just outcome. This is the foundation for acceptance by the community of sentences imposed upon individuals by sentencing judges. But as Kirby J pointed out in Wong para 102, continued public confidence in the administration of justice requires effective transparency and honesty just as those attributes are required of other areas of public administration in contemporary society. The law must facilitate this objective. 
      
       
     268 Individual members of the community will usually be exposed to the criminal process only in a particular case. Victims, and relatives of victims, will very often, and understandably, have difficulty accepting a sentence which has been imposed where consideration of the objective criminality of the offence may have been balanced by the sentencing judge with the fact of a plea of guilty, the age of the offender, whether the offender has any previous convictions and other relevant considerations. Although controversy in relation to an individual sentence may or may not be justified and, even though an error can be corrected on appeal, the fundamental objective of the process must be to ensure that sentencing judges have available to them all the assistance which the law can provide in determining the appropriate sentence in an individual case. 
      
       
     269 Guideline judgments utilised as a “check, guide or indicator” have the benefit of distilling the experience of this and other courts, so that guidance provided by those decisions in relation to other offenders may be readily available to the sentencing judge. They also assist the members of the public, with an interest in the individual case, to understand the reasoning process which resulted in the particular sentence and the relationship of that sentence to other sentences which have been imposed. 
      
       
     270 I agree with the reasons of Spigelman CJ and the order he proposes.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MASON P: This is an appeal by case stated by his Honour Judge Twigg QC. 
      
       
     2 The Stated Case is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. DETERMINATION 
         
        
        
         
         On 12 December 2001 the appellant appeared before me on his appeal against conviction on a charge: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           that he on 26 January 2001 at Ballina in the State of New South Wales did intimidate Constable Goeths, a police officer, whilst the said police officer was executing his duty. 
            Crimes Act s60(1). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, following submissions by the solicitor for the appellant, I held that a prima facie case had been made out. 
         
        
        
         
         2. FACTS 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence before me was capable of establishing the following facts: 
         
        
        
         
         a) Following an incident at a hotel in Ballina the appellant was arrested by the informant and other police and taken to Ballina Police Station. 
         
        
        
         
         b) Later the appellant was placed in a cell by the informant and Constable Martin and his handcuffs removed; 
         
        
        
         
         c) As the two constables were leaving or had just left the cell the appellant looked directly at the informant and said “Wait till I see you on the street, I’ll kill you, youse will get yours, I’ll find where you live and get you”. Constable Goeths then saw the appellant draw his finger across his throat simulating the cutting of his throat; 
         
        
        
         
         d) The informant and Constable Martin then immediately left the cell area; 
         
        
        
         
         e) The informant felt concerned and threatened by the words and actions of the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence before me comprised the oral evidence of the informant, his statement of 3 February 2001 and a transcript of his Local Court evidence of 14 September 2001 together with the statement of Constable Martin of 27 February 2001 and a transcript of his Local Court evidence. Transcript and copies of such evidence are attached to this case. 
         
        
        
         
         3. GROUNDS OF DETERMINATION 
         
        
        
         
         I held that there was a prima facie case upon the ground that 
         
        
        
         
         a) I rejected the appellant’s submission that the offence cannot be committed merely by causing a police officer to experience fear or apprehension. There must be some effect on the police officer whilst he is in the execution of his duty. 
         
        
        
         
         b) That there had, in any event, been sufficient impact upon the officer’s performance of his duty in that he had, following the words of the appellant left the cell area immediately. 
         
        
        
         
         4. APPELLANT’S CONTENTIONS 
         
        
        
         
         a) The offence of intimidation of a police officer under s60(1) requires proof, not merely that the officer was put in fear or apprehension, but that such fear overbore him or her to such an extent that he was influenced to or deterred from some action in the course of his duty. 
         
        
        
         
         b) There was no evidence of any relevant interference with the officer’s duty. 
         
        
        
         
         QUESTIONS FOR DETERMINATION 
         
        
        
         
         1. Is the offence of intimidation of a police officer under s60 of the Crimes Act established by proof of no more than that the acts or words of the accused caused the officer to experience fear or apprehension? 
         
        
        
         
         2. Was I on the evidence presented on behalf of the Prosecutor, entitled to determine that there was a case for the appellant to answer? 
         
        
        
       
     3 Section 60 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         Assault of police officers 
         
        
        
         
         (1) A person who assaults, stalks, harasses or intimidates a police officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty, although no actual bodily harm is occasioned to the officer, is liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A person who assaults a police officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty, and by the assault occasions actual bodily harm, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) A person who maliciously by any means: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) wounds a police officer. or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) inflicts grievous bodily harm on a police officer, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           while in the execution of the officer’s duty is liable to imprisonment for 12 years. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (4) For the purposes of this section, an assault on a police officer is taken to be an assault on the officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty even though the officer is not on duty at the time of the assault, if the assault is committed as a consequence of, or in retaliation for, actions undertaken by the officer in the execution of the officer’s duty. 
         
        
        
        
       
     4 It may be observed that the offences prescribed in the first three subsections all involve conduct directed at “a police officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty”. As to this term generally, see R v K (1993) 46 FCR 336. Subsection (4) gives an extended definition of this concept, but only in the context of an assault.  
      
       
     5 In this section, “assault” obviously includes battery as well as the commission of an act which intentionally or recklessly causes the officer to apprehend to immediate and unlawful violence (cf Knight (1988) 35 A Crim R 314). 
      
       
     6 Simpson J considered the meaning of “intimidates” in s60(1) in Meller v Low (2000) 48 NSWLR 517. Her Honour said (at 519 [9]-[10]): 
      
       
        
         
         With these principles in mind I turn to consider what construction ought be placed on the word “intimidates” as it is used in s60(1). It is, first, an ordinary English word, readily understood, with no technical or complex or concealed meaning. The  
         Oxford English Dictionary 
         , 2nd ed and the  
         Macquarie Dictionary 
           
         are in agreement that “intimidate” means to render timid, to inspire with fear, to overawe, to cow, or to force to or deter from some action by threats or violence or by inducing fear. 
         
        
        
         
         One thing common to the ordinary notion of intimidation, and to all the dictionary definitions given is that the act that constitutes the intimidation has an effect on another person. “Intimidate” is a transitive verb. While particular behaviour may be intimidatory in its nature without causing actual fear or apprehension, there is no intimidation unless and until the behaviour has affected its object in the required manner, that is, by inducing fear or affecting conduct. Behaviour may have a capacity to intimidate, it may be intended or designed to intimidate, but it does not intimidate until it has worked its effect in the person to whom it is directed. Intimidation does not exist in the air. It does not occur until the effect is created. The concept is twofold: intimidation necessarily consists both of a particular form of conduct and the effect the conduct has on another person. There is no intimidation until another person has been intimidated. 
         
        
        
       
     7 Neither party to this appeal invited this Court to reconsider that portion of the decision in Meller that treated “intimidates” as a transitive verb requiring proof of a particular impact upon the officer concerned. I record this without inferring any view on the matter. Questions about the impact of words or conduct upon officers of abnormal sensitivity can therefore be put aside. There is a useful discussion by McPherson JA about the meaning of “intimidate” in Mathews (1992) 64 A Crim R 305 at 307. 
      
       
     8 The Stated Case records that the evidence before the primary judge was capable of establishing that the informant “felt concerned and threatened by the words and actions of the appellant”. Such evidence is, of course, capable of acceptance of proof that the officer was, in truth, put in fear (see Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 6). 
      
       
     9 Mr Rosser QC, who represented the appellant, submitted that the Crown case is defective for want of proof of a further element, namely that the officer’s fear had some effect on him while he was in the execution of his duty. The appellant further submitted that the “effect” had to be more than the emotional impact of the intimidatory conduct. Accordingly, the evidence that the informant left the cell area immediately after hearing and observing the intimidatory conduct was not even sufficient when added to the accepted evidence that the officer was put in genuine fear by the appellants words and actions. At one stage it was suggested that there had to be evidence that the officer had been diverted or corrupted from exercising his duty, although (when pressed) I did not understand the appellant’s case to rest entirely upon such a position. 
      
       
     10 The appellant accepted that this approach to s60(1) was at variance with that adopted by Simpson J in Meller who said that: “There is no intimidation unless and until the behaviour has affected its object in the required manner, that is, by inducing fear or affecting conduct (emphasis added). 
      
       
     11 The appellant sought to make good these submissions by raising concerns about the open-ended nature of the offence unless confined in some such way. It was accepted that the interpretation stemming from Meller requires the Court to be satisfied that the offending conduct had an intimidatory impact upon the officer if the prosecution is based upon that portion of subs (1). Nevertheless, the complaint based upon the broad and indeterminate nature of the offence was maintained. 
      
       
     12 In my view, the appellant’s argument should be rejected because it seeks in effect to add words to the subsection, being words that change the natural meaning of the language used. Such an amendment of the legislative text may not be undertaken lightly (see R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 686-91 for a review of the cases). There is no warrant for doing so in the present case. 
      
       
     13 A further branch of the argument involved reliance upon subs (4) which, as indicated, provides an extended definition of the concept of being in the execution of duty, but only for “an assault on a police officer”. Implicit in that argument was an unstated assumption which should be noted, without the necessity of it being resolved in this appeal. The implicit suggestion is that conduct that constitutes stalking, harassing, intimidating and, presumably. maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm (cf subs (3)) falls outside subs (4) even if that conduct would otherwise constitute an assault. I venture to doubt the correctness of that assumption, although it is a matter upon which Parliament might perhaps clarify its intention.  
      
       
     14 I return to the argument which the appellant sought to erect upon subs (4). It was to the effect that conduct involving stalking, harassing or intimidation has to be directed at a police officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty as that expression is generally known (ie without the extended scope provided by subs (4)). Let that be granted. It does not change the expressed operation of subs (1), nor does it add into that subsection words such as “causing the officer to be deflected from the execution of his or her duty”. 
      
       
     15 One example raised in argument was that of the person who merely said “You will regret this, officer” in a context free from any intent to frighten. I would have thought that this fell outside s60(1) for two reasons namely absence of mens rea and difficulty of proof that the officer was actually put in fear. 
      
       
     16 Likewise with the person who told an arresting officer of his intent to report the officer to a body such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Although such an intimidation might well cause a sense of fear in some circumstances, it would not be the type of fear (ie for personal safety) contemplated by the dictionary definitions of “intimidation” adopted by Simpson J in Meller. 
      
       
        
       Postscript  
       
     17 Before a person exercises any of the functions of a police officer, he or she must take the prescribed oath or make the prescribed affirmation of office as a police officer (Police Service Act 1990, s13). The Police Service Regulation 2000, cl 8 provides the substance of the oath as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           I, do swear that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lady the Queen as a police officer without favour or affection, malice or ill-will until l am legally discharged, that I will cause Her Majesty’s peace to be kept and preserved, and that I will prevent to the best of my power all offences against that peace, and that while I continue to be a police officer I will to the best of my skill and knowledge discharge all my duties faithfully according to law. So help me God. 
           
          
         
        
        
       
     18 An oath in this form can be traced back to at least 1852 in this State (see An Act for the Regulation of the Police Force, 16 Vict 33, s8). A virtually identical oath was required by the Special Constables Act 1831 (Imp) (1 & 2 Will IV 41). 
      
       
     19 The oath bears certain similarities to the judicial oath, although (of present relevance) it speaks of serving the monarch “without favour or affection, malice or ill-will”, thereby omitting the reference to “fear” found in the traditional judicial oath. Be that as it may, the absence of a reference to “fear” in the police officer’s oath or affirmation does not mean that officers are immune from fear. Parliament has seen fit to prescribe an offence one of whose integers is the intimidation of a police officer while in the execution of the officer’s duty. If the tribunal of fact is satisfied on the criminal standard that the officer was put in fear by the offender’s intentional conduct, then it is not necessary to establish that the officer was overborne to the extent that he or she was influenced to or deterred from some action or otherwise corrupted in the execution of duty. 
      
       
     20 The questions for determination should be answered: 
      
       
       1. Yes 
        
       2. Yes.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Lloyd William Jackson, was tried in the District Court before her Honour, Judge Payne and a jury on an indictment containing two counts of homosexual intercourse, one count of assaulting a male with intent to have homosexual intercourse and one count of committing an act of gross indecency with a male. He was found guilty of three of those four counts, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He appeals against conviction only. 
      
       
     2 The offences were alleged to have been committed upon the same complainant between 1985 and 1986, when the complainant was aged between sixteen and seventeen years and was an employee of the appellant. It is unnecessary to recite the evidence at the trial. The only ground of appeal arises from the unusual course which the trial took. 
      
       
     3 It is sufficient to say that the case was basically one of word against word. The appellant gave evidence denying any sexual contact whatsoever with the complainant. There was a delay of over thirteen years before the complainant made any complaint of the appellant’s alleged conduct. 
      
       
     4 The matter which is agitated in the appeal arises in this way. On 6 September 2001 the appellant was arraigned and a jury was empanelled. The jury was excused until 10 September and, as I understand it, some legal matters were addressed in the meantime. On 10 September the trial got underway in the presence of the jury. For reasons which need not concern us, the evidence of the complainant was given in somewhat piecemeal fashion over the four days between 10 and 13 September. 
      
       
     5 On 13 and 14 September other evidence in the Crown case was called. A weekend intervened and, by Monday, 17 September, an issue had arisen about the appellant’s fitness to be tried. On that day and on the following day the jury was sent away whilst there was discussion about how that matter should be dealt with. 
      
       
     6 On 19 September the jury was sent away until 27 September. On that day counsel then appearing for the appellant sought the discharge of the jury. There does not appear to have been a formal ruling on that application but, clearly, her Honour did not take that course. In the event, a fresh jury was empanelled to try the issue of the appellant’s fitness. That trial proceeded between 24 and 27 September, on which day the appellant was found fit to be tried. 
      
       
     7 The trial resumed with the original jury on 28 September. On that day counsel then appearing for the appellant made a further application for the discharge of the jury. That application was refused and her Honour gave formal reasons for that decision on 3 October. I shall turn to those in a moment. 
      
       
     8 On 28 September the evidence resumed. The Crown case was completed and the accused gave evidence. On the same day counsels’ addresses commenced. A long weekend intervened and addresses were completed on Tuesday 2 October. The summing up commenced that same day and the jury retired to consider its verdicts on 3 October. The verdicts were returned some hours later that day. 
      
       
     9 The application for discharge of the jury which was made on 28 September was pressed on a number of bases. Counsel argued, firstly, that the jury had been absent for the best part of fourteen days and that they would be unlikely to have an adequate recollection of the evidence and demeanour of the witnesses who had already given evidence. Secondly, it was said that the jury would be left with a much stronger recollection of the appellant’s evidence, which had been given after the trial resumed, perhaps to the disadvantage of the appellant.  
      
       
     10 Thirdly, the Court was on notice that one of the jurors planned to travel overseas on 4 October, that is the day after which the jury in fact delivered their verdicts, and it was argued that that juror may well be under undue pressure and be inhibited in his or her ability to give the case proper attention. There was another matter raised in support of the application which has not been canvassed before us, and I need not refer to it. 
      
       
     11 In refusing the application, her Honour expressed the view that the appellant appeared to her to have acquitted himself well in the course of his evidence. Her Honour noted that the jury had requested the transcript of the evidence to be available to them upon their retirement, and her Honour also had regard to the fact that the evidence in the trial was within a relatively narrow compass and the issue was a straightforward one. Her Honour determined, accordingly, that there would be no unfairness to the appellant in the trial continuing. 
      
       
     12 It should be observed, of course, that her Honour gave her formal reasons on 3 October, after the jury had retired to consider its verdicts and, to some extent, those reasons were influenced by what her Honour had observed since the application for discharge had been made. 
      
       
     13 Before us, Mr Wendler, who appears for the appellant, agitated the same matters as those raised by trial counsel in support of the only ground of appeal, which is that her Honour erred in declining to discharge the jury. The real question, of course, is whether it appears to this Court that, as a result of that course of events, the trial miscarried. 
      
       
     14 Mr Wendler summarised the matters raised by trial counsel by a submission that effectively, by the time the trial was resumed before the jury, it had lost its momentum. He relied also on the separate matter of the juror who had plans to go overseas. 
      
       
     15 I am not persuaded that her Honour’s discretion miscarried or that the trial, in the event, was unfair to the appellant. As the Crown Prosecutor in this Court has pointed out in written submissions, a number of steps were taken to overcome any difficulty which might have arisen from the delay in the trial.  
      
       
     16 As I have said, the jury requested, and were supplied with, the transcript of the whole of the evidence. It seems that the addresses of counsel were quite lengthy and her Honour took the course of summarising the evidence in considerably greater detail than she might otherwise have done. In addition, her Honour gave very strong warnings to the jury about the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with care and about the danger of convicting upon his evidence, together with the significance of the very long delay in complaint. 
      
       
     17 One of the specific matters raised is that the jury would have been unlikely to have recalled, after such a gap, their impression of the demeanour of the complainant. For myself, I do not see why that would be so. An impression of his demeanour, if it played any part in the jury’s deliberations at all, would have been made at the time they saw and heard him, and I see no reason why that recollection would have been erased by the passage of about a fortnight before the trial resumed. 
      
       
     18 As to the matter of the juror who planned to go overseas, as I have said, the verdicts were in fact given in about the middle of the day before he planned to do so. I should add that, at the end of the summing up, her Honour assured that juror that his or her plans to travel overseas would not be prevented by the jury’s deliberations. There was no record of any discussion before her Honour said that. I can only take it, however, that it was agreed that, if need be, the juror would be discharged if the jury were unable to reach a verdict before the anticipated time of departure. 
      
       
     19 There is ample authority in this Court that the decision of a trial judge on an application to discharge a jury is very much a discretionary one, and one with which this Court would not lightly interfere. That is partly an application of the normal principles governing appellate review of the exercise of a judicial discretion, and partly a recognition of the fact that the trial judge is uniquely placed to make that judgment in the light of the events as they have unfolded in the trial court. 
      
       
     20 As I have said, I am not persuaded that her Honour’s discretion miscarried, or that, with the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that the appellant’s trial was unfair. I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     21 SHELLER JA: I agree. 
      
       
     22 ADAMS J: I also agree. 
      
       
     23 SHELLER JA: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v Peter Leslie MARTIN 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     The appellant applied for an extension of time to appeal against his conviction on 28 September 2001 by a jury in the District Court in Lismore on two charges. The first charge was that on 3 July 1998 he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Gary Edwards with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The second charge was that on the same date he maliciously wounded Eli Edwards with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
      
       
     Both charges arose from the appellant's involvement with two other men in an attack on Gary and Eli Edwards. One of the assailants, Colin Stevens, was subsequently convicted for his role in instituting and coordinating the attack. The appellant denied that he had been involved in the incident. 
      
       
     The appellant was arrested after the police identified his blood on a bat used in the assaults and on the inside of the left shoe which was worn by Stevens during the assaults. The appellant sought to explain the presence of his blood on these articles by arguing that the blood must have been spilt during the afternoon of the day of the assaults after a wound he had sustained to his left index finger on the day prior had bled when he accompanied Stevens to Stevens's farm. The appellant relied on this explanation; an alibi which was supported by his wife; the uncontested evidence of his good character; and the evidence of Stevens, who named two other men as the people who accompanied him to commit the assaults. 
      
       
     The Crown case was based on the blood/DNA evidence and the testimony of the appellant's former business partner who claimed that the appellant had made confessions to him as to his involvement in the attacks. The appellant challenged the reliability of the evidence of his former business partner on the basis that the animosity between them was such that his evidence was untruthful. 
      
       
     It was argued on appeal that the verdict was unsafe in that the jury should have found reasonable doubt in relation to the guilt of the appellant.  
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Dowd J and Carruthers AJ concurring) 
      
       
     3. The appellant's attack on the verdict amounted to no more than saying that the Crown's case could not safely and beyond reasonable doubt be accepted in preference to the appellant’s denial that he took part in the assault, his alibi supported by his wife’s evidence and an innocent explanation for the presence of his blood. 
      
       
     3. The Court applied the test identified in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at 87-88. The jury heard the evidence of all the witnesses and saw them give it. Upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. 
      
       
     3. An extension of time up to and including the date of filing of the notice of appeal was granted. The Court dismissed the appeal. 
      
       
        
        ORDERS 
        
        
       1. Extend the time to appeal up to and including the date of the filing of the notice of appeal. 
        
        
       2. Appeal dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: The appellant, Peter Leslie Martin, applies for an extension of time to appeal against his conviction on 28 September 2001 by a jury in the District Court in Lismore on two charges. The first charge was that on the 3 July 1998 at Alstonville he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Gary Edwards with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. The second charge was that on the same date he maliciously wounded Eli Kabe Edwards with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to him. The presiding judge, his Honour Judge Ducker, on 8 November 2001 for the first offence imposed a sentence of three years and six months imprisonment to date from 28 September 2001 with a non-parole period of two years and for the second offence imposed a sentence of two years and six months imprisonment to date from 28 September 2001 with a non-parole period of one year and nine months. An appeal by the Crown against these sentences was abandoned. 
      
       
        
       The Crown case 
        
       
     2 A summary of the Crown’s case is as follows. At approximately 8.15pm on 3 July 1998 three men entered the property of Gary Edwards and his son, Eli Edwards, at 8 McGill Place, Alstonville. The men wore balaclavas. One was armed with a baseball bat and the other two were armed with pieces of timber. Hearing the sounds of footsteps outside his window, Eli Edwards, then aged 21 years, went outside to investigate and was set upon by three men. Eli Edwards called out to his father and when Gary Edwards stepped outside he too was attacked. Gary Edwards was knocked to the ground and was beaten by one man while the other two continued to attack Eli Edwards. At one stage during the attack Eli Edwards managed to lie on top of his father in an attempt to protect him, and the three men continued to beat the two victims as they lay together on the ground. Eventually the three men decamped from the scene and the police and ambulance were called. 
      
       
     3 As a result of the attack Gary Edwards suffered injuries which included: a deep laceration to his left temple and zygomatic region, an 18 centimetre by 9 centimetre L-shaped laceration to his right thigh, a 5 centimetre by 5 centimetre laceration to his right forearm, a fracture of the olecranon process of the right elbow, a fracture of the left zygomatic arch and a left side pneumothorax. Eli Edwards suffered a 7 centimetre by 2 centimetre laceration to his scalp and a one centimetre laceration to his right elbow as well as multiple skin bruises and welts. 
      
       
     4 At one stage during the attack Eli Edwards struggled with one of his assailants and was able to dislodge the man’s balaclava. Eli Edwards recognised the man as Colin Stevens. Gary Edwards died, from unrelated causes, before the matter came to trial and a statement that he made to the police on 22 July 1998 was read to the jury. Gary Edwards told police that he was able to recognise the voice of a second attacker as that of a man named Shane Campbell. In his evidence, Eli Edwards stated that Stevens and the man, whom he believed was Campbell, attacked him, and that the third man carried out the main attack on his father. 
      
       
     5 Eli Edwards said that the third man was taller and skinnier than the other two. Eli Edwards said that he himself was six feet one or two inches tall and taller than the third man, who he said, would have been “a bit shorter” than his eye level. The other two men were short men. 
      
       
     6 There had been a history of animosity between Colin Stevens and the Edwards family because of a relationship between Colin Stevens’s then 14 year old daughter, Tara, and Gary Edwards’s then 19 year old son, Jesse. During the early hours of 4 July 1998 police attended the home of Colin Stevens where he was arrested. A white Toyota Camry sedan was parked in the driveway of Stevens’s premises. Colin Stevens had hired the vehicle at about 9.45 am on 3 July 1998 from Hertz Rent-a-Car at Lismore for a one day period. 
      
       
     7 Detective Senior Constable Day of the Crime Scene Section gave evidence that he went to the crime scene and then to Stevens’s premises. At Stevens’s premises he observed a number of blood stains on the off-side of the Camry’s bonnet and further blood stains in different areas of the interior of the vehicle. On the floor of the vehicle, on the near-side of the front passenger seat, he saw a piece of timber that appeared to be the handle section of a recently broken timber baton. He observed a small stain on the handle that appeared to be blood. Later that day he collected samples of blood stains from six locations on the vehicle: · two from the bonnet, · one from the rear-vision mirror, · two from sections of carpet fibre, and · one from the rear off-side floor door.  
      
       
        
       Detective Day also examined a pair of Boarders brand shoes that were seized from Colin Stevens. He observed what appeared to be blood stains on the inside white wall of the left shoe and on the outside lower portion of the left shoe. 
        
       
     8 On 8 July 1998 the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Saad, spoke to the appellant at his home. Detective Saad asked the appellant about his movements on 3 July 1998. The appellant said that his mate, Col Stevens, came around about 4 o’clock and that he had a few beers with him. Stevens drove him in a white car to Stevens’s hydroponics farm where he got some spinach. Stevens dropped him off at about 5.30 or 6.00pm and he stayed up with the kids until about 8.00pm or 8.30pm. He got up at about 11.00pm and went to work at midnight. He had a couple of beers on the way to the farm and a couple of beers at the farm. He said that he sat in the front of the car on the way to the farm and that when he was there they sat around drinking and he sat in the back. 
      
       
     9 Detective Saad asked the appellant about an injury that was visible on the appellant’s left index finger. The appellant, who worked as a baker, said that he sustained the injury at work when he was cleaning the high-speed dough mixer. He said that the injury occurred “about last Wednesday or Thursday”. It bled for a while and he put a Band-aid on it and it stopped. Detective Saad asked the appellant if it bled when he was with Colin Stevens, and the appellant said he was not sure. Detective Saad asked the appellant if he could remember whether the injury bled whilst he was in the car with Stevens. The appellant replied, “I don’t know, if the Band-aid was off it probably did, but I can’t remember”.  
      
       
     10 Janelle Kopp gave evidence that she was a pastry cook employed by the appellant’s bakery. She normally worked from about 1 am to 8 or 9am, five days per week. She was not able to say exactly what hours the appellant worked in early July 1998. He usually came to work at about 4 to 5am. She did not have a recollection of the appellant’s having an injury to his hand in the few days leading up to 3 July 1998. She was not aware of any staff members injuring themselves whilst cleaning the high-speed dough mixer at the bakery.  
      
       
     11 In cross examination Ms Kopp said that she was aware of animosity between the appellant and his then business partner, Mr Jeffrey Eyles. She was unable to say one way or another whether the appellant did or did not have an injury to his hand around the time in question. 
      
       
     12 Bradley Walker gave evidence that in 1998 he was a baker, employed by the appellant and Mr Eyles. He knew of Colin Stevens, who used to come to the back door of the bakery two or three times a month to visit the appellant. In July 1998 he was working from midnight until about 6 or 7am. One Saturday morning in July 1998 the appellant received a telephone call at about 2 or 3am. After he took the phone call the appellant came back and continued working and was quiet. Later that morning a paddy wagon drove past and the appellant shut the bakery door. 
      
       
     13 Mr Walker said that he had jammed his finger in the dough mixing machine. He had not suffered an injury from the machine that required a Band-aid. On the morning that the paddy wagon drove past he noticed that the appellant had Band-aids on two fingers. He did not know how the appellant had sustained the injury. He did not know if the appellant had ever injured himself on the dough mixing machine but he had not seen the appellant injure himself on the machine. 
      
       
     14 In cross examination Mr Walker agreed that the door may have blown shut itself when the paddy wagon drove past. He said that he observed angry exchanges between the appellant and Mr Eyles. 
      
       
     15 Darren McFadden said that at one time he was employed at the bakery as a bread maker. He normally started work at midnight or 1am and that he finished anywhere between 8 or 9am. Mr McFadden knew Colin Stevens. Stevens would visit the bakery at least once per week to speak to the appellant. On occasions he had bruised his finger when he had been cleaning the high-speed dough mixing machine. 
      
       
     16 Mr McFadden said that on one Saturday morning when he was working, the appellant received a phone call from a lady. He could not be exact on the date but that he thought it was 14 July. The appellant, Bradley Walker and he were working during that particular shift. The appellant had telephoned at about 1am to let them know that he was on his way to work and that he was running a bit late. In the early hours of the morning he answered a telephone call from a female. He spoke to the appellant and told him that ‘Debbie’ was on the phone. The appellant took the call and was on the phone for “roughly 10 to 15 minutes”. He did not observe any injuries to the appellant’s hands on the night that the appellant took the phone call. 
      
       
     17 The appellant was arrested on 20 September 1999. When cautioned, the appellant replied, “I don’t know nothing about it”. The appellant consented to the taking of a blood sample. 
      
       
     18 Christine Gill, a forensic biologist employed by the Division of Analytical Laboratories, analysed a number of articles including the following: · the timber baton handle, · blood swabs and carpet fibres taken from the Toyota Camry vehicle, · the Boarders shoes that belonged to Colin Stevens, · a blood swab from a stool at the crime scene, · a blood swab from the rear steps of the crime scene, · a pair of jeans that belonged to the appellant, and· a pair of joggers that belonged to the appellant.  
      
       
        
       Ms Gill analysed blood samples taken from Gary Edwards, Eli Edwards, Colin Stevens, Shane Campbell and the appellant. A schedule, setting out the results of the various tests that were carried out, was tendered as exhibit F in the Crown case. 
        
       
     19 Ms Gill gave evidence that the appellant’s DNA profile, using the Profiler Plus system, was the same as the DNA recovered from the blood stain on the timber baton handle. She said that the profile is expected to be found in fewer than one in 10 billion individuals in the general population. DNA testing was also carried out on a blood stain on the inside step of the left boarders brand shoe. The DNA recovered from that area was also the same profile as the appellant’s. 
      
       
     20 Blood grouping tests revealed that it was possible that the blood on the swabs from the bonnet of the vehicle, from the rear vision mirror, from carpet fibres from the vehicle and from the rear off side floor door had come from the appellant. No blood was detected on the appellant’s jeans. Blood grouping tests carried out on one area of the appellant’s joggers excluded the possibility that the blood on that area had come from either Gary Edwards or Eli Edwards. There was insufficient DNA material in two other areas of staining on the shoes for testing to be performed. 
      
       
     21 The appellant’s former business partner, Mr Eyles, gave evidence that the appellant had made admissions to him about his involvement in the attack. In about 1995 he and the appellant went into partnership in a bakery business. At first his relationship with the appellant was good but it did not take long for it to sour. He saw Colin Stevens at the shop quite often and he knew of Stevens’s problem concerning his daughter and Jesse Edwards. About two weeks before the attack he spoke to Stevens about the trouble he was having with the Edwards’s. Stevens told him that he was going to do something about it. He was getting some people into town to bust some heads. Mr Eyles told the appellant that Stevens had told him that they were going to get some blokes out of town to bust some heads. The appellant said, “Yes Stevens was getting some people out of town to fix the Edwards’s up”. 
      
       
     22 Mr Eyles learnt of the attack on the Edwards’s on the night that it occurred. The next morning he went to work at about 4am. He had last finished work at 6pm on the previous Wednesday. While he was at work he observed that the appellant had an injury to one of his fingers. The finger was bleeding and the appellant was putting a piece of Elastoplast-type tape on it. At first Mr Eyles thought it was a fresh cut but then he realised that it was not fresh because it had white skin around it. The injury was a “pretty jagged cut” and looked like it needed stitches. Mr Eyles remarked to the appellant that it was a bad cut. The appellant told him that he had done it a couple of days beforehand. 
      
       
     23 Mr Eyles said that one Sunday morning about four or five weeks after the attack he spoke to the appellant and asked him if he was involved in the Edwards bashing. The appellant replied that he was and that he enjoyed it. The appellant told him that he went with “Col to do the bashing”. The appellant also said “I hated the Edwards’s” and  
      
       
        
         
         “it was great havin’ Louis on the ground thumpin’ the shit out of him. He was yelling for mercy. He was yelling out, ‘why me, what did I do?’ With that Eli come out the door. Eli ended up on top of his father so we flogged shit outa him.” 
         
        
       
     24 Mr Eyles said that a couple of weeks later he had another conversation about the matter with the appellant. There had been some trouble with Mr Edwards senior standing at the front of the shop and yelling out that he was going to kill the appellant. Mr Eyles spoke to the appellant about Mr Edwards coming to the shop. The appellant became very aggressive and said, “we should’ve gone back and finished what we started”. 
      
       
     25 In about September 1999 My Eyles went to the appellant’s home. At the time there were problems with the business. He told the appellant that a lot of trouble stemmed from the appellant’s association with Colin Stevens and that he had had enough of it and wanted to get out of the business. The appellant said that he had listened to Colin Stevens and that he was sorry that he’d done it and it had caused him nothing but trouble. 
      
       
     26 On 15 September 1999 Mr Eyles made a statement to the police. 
      
       
     27 In cross examination Mr Eyles classed his relationship with the appellant as a “love-hate” one. He agreed that at many times the relationship was rocky and that it culminated in him deciding that he would sell out to the appellant for the sum of $50,000. He agreed that he went to the police and made a statement two days after he received the final payment from the appellant. It was suggested to Mr Eyles that the appellant had tackled him over the appellant’s belief that Mr Eyles was taking money out of the business. Mr Eyles said that the appellant had never spoken to him about it and that he had not heard any mention of it before. He did not remember that such a proposition had been put to him at the committal proceedings. 
      
       
     28 It was put to Mr Eyles that because of his feelings of animosity towards the appellant he was prepared to say anything, whether it be true or untrue. Mr Eyles disagreed and said that he was not prepared to lie. He wanted to get his money. That was why he waited until September 1999 before he went to the police. Mr Eyles agreed that he had refreshed his memory from his statement and that he could not rely on his memory to give precise words of the admissions. It was suggested to Mr Eyles that at no time did the appellant say anything to him that could be construed as a confession to being involved in the attack. Mr Eyles disagreed. 
      
       
     29 In re-examination Mr Eyles said that he had a friend named Lindsay Church. On at least one occasion he had confided in Mr Church about what the appellant had told him about his involvement in the assault upon the Edwards’s. 
      
       
     30 Mr Church gave evidence that he had known Mr Eyles for about six years. He knew Colin Stevens. In 1998 Stevens lived not far from him. He knew the appellant from going to his bread shop. At about 10am on the morning of Friday 3 July 1998 he saw the appellant and Colin Stevens driving in the direction of McGill Place, where the Edwards’s lived. Mr Church said that he and Mr Eyles fished together regularly. About ten months after the attack on the Edwards’s, Mr Eyles said words to the effect of, “Snow [the appellant] admitted to me that he was with Stevens when they bashed the Edwards’s [sic]”. 
      
       
     31 In cross examination Mr Church said that when he saw the appellant and Stevens on the morning of 3 July 1998 they were in Stevens’s wife’s car. The car was red. It was “a Hyundai or Kia or something like that”. 
      
       
     32 Colin Stevens gave evidence that he was serving two custodial sentences, one for the attack on the Edwards’s, and the other for a home invasion committed at Tabulam on 1 June 1999. He committed the Tabulam offence with Phillip Leadbeater. He had pleaded guilty to both offences. He agreed that by the time he pleaded guilty to the Tabulam offence, Leadbeater had already pleaded guilty. He was aware that Leadbeater had given the police a statement implicating him in the Tabulam offence and identifying him as the principal offender. When he pleaded guilty to the Edwards offence on the morning of his trial, he was aware that the Crown proposed to call Leadbeater to given evidence that he had confessed his involvement in the offence to him. He said that Leadbeater had lied. 
      
       
     33 Stevens said that he had committed the offence against the Edwards’s. He had been accompanied by Phillip Leadbeater and Shane Campbell. The Crown prosecutor suggested to Stevens that the only offence that Leadbeater had been involved in with Stevens was the offence at Tabulam. Mr Stevens replied, “You can suggest that as much as you like.” He said that when they came back from the “Leadbeaters” (Edwards’s) there were four other people in his house: Theresa Parker, Robert Freeman and his, Stevens’s, son and wife. Stevens said that the police had never questioned any of these people. 
      
       
     34 Stevens said that he had hired a motor vehicle on the morning of the offence because he had had trouble with his car, a Holden Commodore. There were two other vehicles at his house besides the Commodore: a Willeys Jeep and his wife’s Hyundai. The Hyundai was blue. After Stevens hired the car he went straight to work. He did not see the appellant that morning. 
      
       
     35 Asked how he came to be with Leadbeater on the night of the offences Stevens said that he had picked him up from his caravan park in Ballina. Stevens was asked if that was where Leadbeater was living and he replied, “Yes when he – when he was in Ballina that’s where he was living”. It was suggested to Stevens that in July 1998 Leadbeater was living and working in Brisbane, and he replied, “Yeah he was, yeah I know”.  
      
       
     36 It was put to Stevens that after the police spoke to him about the attack on the Edwards’s he produced an alibi notice. He could not recall, but it was more than likely that he did. It was put to him that his wife had given a statement and that it was proposed that she would give evidence that he had been home all night and had not left. He had not seen the statement but his wife could well have made one. He did not really know what his wife was going to say. He was asked if he was aware that his wife was going to say that when she got home there was nobody there except him and the children. He said that he could not recall. 
      
       
     37 Mr Stevens was asked about the attack on the Edwards’s. He said that he attacked Mr Edwards senior, that he hit him, that he fell off the porch and landed on a pile of rocks where he stayed and was not touched again. He struck him one blow with a round piece of wood. The piece of wood was like a blockbuster handle. Mr Edwards senior was only hit once by him and the other two men did not attack him. The one blow struck Mr Edwards Senior across the face. 
      
       
     38 Stevens said that it was Leadbeater and Campbell that attacked Eli Edwards. They were armed with sticks. He was asked if anybody was armed with a baseball bat and he said that Campbell’s stick was shaped like a baseball bat. He was aware that the baseball bat type object had been broken and that that had occurred when Campbell hit Eli Edwards. 
      
       
     39 Stevens said that Campbell was with him from about 4.30pm onwards on the afternoon of the offence. Campbell was dropped off at the farm by his sister. The appellant came to the farm, which was at Uralba, at about  
      
       
       3pm and he stayed there until probably about 4.30 or 4.45pm. He was asked if he was saying that the appellant was there when Campbell was there and he said he couldn’t recall. The appellant left in his own car. 
        
       
     40 Stevens said that he had the weapons in the back of the car from about lunchtime onwards. He was asked if a baseball bat and two pieces of timber were in the back seat and he said that he thought that it was just Campbell’s stuff that was in the back. The baseball bat was Campbell’s and it was in the back seat on the floor. He had three beers with the appellant and they were sitting in the car drinking. Sometimes he sat in the back and sometimes the appellant sat in the back. 
      
       
     41 Stevens said that after they had committed the offence he and the other two men dumped “the balaclavas and that” in an industrial waste bin outside of Wollongbar and then went back to his house. Then they decided to retrieve the items, which they burnt. They went to Ballina where he dropped the other two men off and he went home. 
      
       
     42 Stevens said that Leadbeater was lying when he said that he had read Stevens’s brief when they were both in gaol at Grafton. He never had a brief for Leadbeater to read. The only reason that Leadbeater knew about the Edwards matter was because he was there. 
      
       
     43 It was put to Stevens that on 8 May 2001 he spoke to Detectives King and Brown while he was in Grafton gaol and told them that he would give evidence against the appellant but that he wanted two years home detention for doing so. Stevens denied saying that, and said that he had already been sentenced and that he could not get any time off his sentence. 
      
       
     44 It was suggested that the only reason that Stevens had given evidence was because he had a grudge against Leadbeater for implicating him in the Tabulam offence and that he was out for revenge. 
      
       
     45 In cross examination Stevens was shown a copy of the rental car agreement showing that he had checked the car out at 9.50am (exhibit 4). He said that he drove to Farmer Charlie’s where he collected some boxes. He was there for about 10 or 15 minutes and then he drove straight to his farm at Uralba. He did not see the appellant until the afternoon. The appellant stayed with him for about an hour and a half, during which time they drank some beers and the appellant gave him a hand with some packing. He observed that the appellant had a cut because he dropped some blood on the car. He could not remember where the cut was. He was asked if he discussed the cut with the appellant and he said that he thought that the appellant had got his hand stuck in the dough maker at work. 
      
       
     46 Phillip Leadbeater gave evidence that he was involved with Stevens in a home invasion in Tabulam on 1 June 1999. He had offered to give evidence for the Crown against Stevens in relation to that matter. The source of his knowledge in relation to Stevens’s involvement in the Edwards bashing was seeing the brief when he was in gaol. When he was in gaol Stevens told him that he had been involved in the bashing. He said that Stevens did not tell him who else had been involved. 
      
       
     47 Leadbeater said that in July 1998 he was living in Geebung in North Brisbane. He was definitely not in Alstonville with Stevens on the night of 3 July 1998. He was definitely not in New South Wales that night. Leadbeater first met Stevens sometime in early 1999 about three or four months before he committed the Tabulam offence. He had met him very briefly before that when he had lived in Ballina years ago, and his and Stevens’s children had played together. He first met Stevens’s wife, Debra Stevens, on 1 June 1999, on the night of the Tabulam offence. Leadbeater said that he worked for Calmac in Brisbane from 1 March 1997 to 4 March 1998 and from 29 June 1998 to 15 July 1998. 
      
       
     48 According to Mr Leadbeater he was roughly 180 centimetres or 6 feet one inch tall. 
      
       
     49 Ms Gill gave evidence that on 21 September 2001 she was asked to compare Leadbeater’s DNA profile with the results that she had already obtained. She said that Leadbeater’s sample had been typed using the Profiler Plus system. The only items which had been typed using the same system were the timber handle and the left shoe and she was able to exclude Leadbeater from those articles. 
      
       
        
       The defence case 
        
       
     50 The defence case can be summarised as follows. The appellant gave evidence and was cross examined. He said that he was a man of good character and had never been convicted of any offence of violence. 
      
       
     51 He had formerly been in partnership with Mr Eyles. About twelve months after starting the business he spoke to Mr Eyles because he was worried about how much was being produced and how much money was in the bank. Even after the initial business loan was paid off things did not improve. After he bought out Mr Eyles, the takings went up. 
      
       
     52 The appellant knew Colin Stevens through his children but Stevens was not a good friend. The first time he went to Stevens’s farm was on 3 July 1998 to look at the farm and to get some spinach. He went to the farm with Stevens in Stevens’s white Camry vehicle. He arrived at the farm at about 3.30 or 4pm and he stayed there for “probably a bit over an hour, hour and a half”. They picked spinach for probably about 15 minutes. They were having a few beers while they were doing that. He was watching Stevens bunching the spinach. He was sitting around in the Camry. The Camry’s doors were open. He sat in the front and back of the Camry. 
      
       
     53 The appellant said that when he was sitting in the front seat he went to move the seat back and his hand hit a stick. He looked down and saw a small children’s bat. He handled the bat and put it back under the front passenger seat. The bat was not broken. 
      
       
     54 The appellant said that on the Thursday night – Friday morning shift, before going to the farm he injured his left index finger when he was cleaning his high-speed dough mixer. He described the injury as “a jagged sort of broken skin, deep injury”. It was not a neat cut. The injury bled a lot at first and bled on and off over the next couple of days. 
      
       
     55 The appellant said that when he got home from work he showed the injury to his wife, Sue. He showered and put more band-aids on his finger and then went to bed because he knew that Colin Stevens was going to pick him up to take him to the farm. He thought his finger bled while he was at the farm but he didn’t pay any particular attention. He helped Stevens pick spinach and Stevens brought him back home. 
      
       
     56 The appellant said that on the morning of 3 July at approximately 10am he did not drive with Stevens in a red car past Mr Church’s place towards McGill’s Avenue. The first time that he saw Stevens that day was at approximately 3.30 or 4pm when Stevens picked him up. When he got home he helped his wife with the tea because she was feeling sick. After tea he watched television with his children and went to bed at about 8.30 or 8.45pm. He got up at about 10.45pm and went to work. He would have arrived at work at about midnight or five to ten minutes later. During the shift he received a telephone call from Debbie Stevens, who told him that Colin had been arrested and that her son Brodie would not be at football the next day. He spoke to Debbie Stevens for probably a maximum of two or three minutes. 
      
       
     57 The appellant denied being one of the people who went with Colin Stevens to bash the two Edwards men. 
      
       
     58 The appellant said that the conversations that he had with Mr Eyles about the money aspect of the business created quite a bit of friction and that the partnership began to sour because of the friction. His relationship with Mr Eyles during 1998 through into 1999 was not very good at all. He would not classify the relationship as “love-hate”. It was “Basically a dislike on both sides… continuous”.59 The appellant said that Mr Eyles never asked him about his involvement in the bashing and that he never said anything to Mr Eyles that could be construed by him as an admission as to his involvement in the bashing of the two Edwards men. The bashing was spoken about in the workplace amongst the workers and it was spoken about all over town. 
      
       
     60 The appellant said that Mr Eyles came to his home on about 5 August 1999. They spoke about the business and Mr Eyles asked him for an extra $10,000. He told Mr Eyles that he would ask his wife and he left the room and went into the bedroom and spoke to his wife. His wife told him, “No way”, and he went back to Mr Eyles and told him they could not afford to do it. Eyles then said, “Right I’ll play my trump card’. Eyles said, “Saad has been putting pressure on me to involve you in the Edwards bashing, if you don’t give me the 10,000 I will”. He told Eyles that he was mad and to “fuck off”. 
      
       
     61 Mr Eric Thompson, an accountant, gave evidence that he took over the auditing of the appellant’s business after the partnership with Mr Eyles was dissolved. He examined the records of the business before the dissolution of the partnership. During the period 1997, 1998 and through to 30 June 1999, when the partnership was in existence, it appeared that money had been removed from the business before being banked. It appeared that $30,000 to $40,000 per annum had disappeared from the business. 
      
       
     62 The appellant’s de facto wife, Susan Thompson, gave evidence. She said on 3 July 1998 she stayed at home because she was sick. The appellant told her that he was going to get some spinach for the shop and she told him that she wanted him home before 6pm so that he could help her with dinner and with the children. The appellant came home as requested and he stayed there for the rest of the night until he went to work. The appellant went to bed at about 9pm and went to work around 11.30pm. 
      
       
     63 Ms Thompson said that on the morning of 3 July 1998 her husband showed her an injury around the knuckle of his left index finger. She said that the injury was more like a gash than a cut. A couple of days after Detective Saad first came to their house, he telephoned and spoke about obtaining a blood test from the appellant. She said to Detective Saad, “Peter was not involved in that incident… You could have asked me about it, he wasn’t involved, he wasn’t there, he was with me, with me at home”. She told the appellant’s solicitor that the appellant was at home with her, a considerable period of time prior to the alibi notice going to the police. 
      
       
     64 Ms Thompson said that she was at home when Mr Eyles came to the house and spoke to the appellant about being bought out of the partnership. She was in the bedroom and could hear the conversation between the appellant and Mr Eyles. Mr Eyles said that he wanted an extra $10,000. The appellant came and spoke to her about it. She said, “No”, and the appellant went back and told Mr Eyles. Mr Eyles raised his voice and said, “Detective Saad’s been trying to implicate you in this Edwards bashing, he’s been on to me.” He said, “I’ll pull out my trump card”. The appellant said, “Trump card?” and Mr Eyles replied, “Yes, if you don’t give me the $10,000 I’m going in to implicate you”. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of appeal 
        
       
     65 There were two substantive grounds of appeal filed. The first was that the jury’s verdict was unsafe in that the jury should have found reasonable doubt in relation to the guilt of the appellant for reasons or combination of reasons set out in 17 paragraphs that followed. The second ground of appeal in the alternative was that the appellant did not receive a fair trial for eight reasons which were set out. Mr Bellanto QC, who appeared for the appellant, abandoned many of the grounds of appeal including those itemised under ground 2. Mr Bellanto invited the Court to uphold the appeal on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory or, in the language of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that it was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Counsel submitted that the following matters combined to lead to this conclusion: 
      
       
        
       1. The appellant was, as he stated in evidence and the Crown conceded, a man of good character who had never been convicted for any offence of violence or dishonesty. Accordingly, he was an unlikely person to have engaged in the conduct of which he was accused. 
        
        
       2. He was not identified by anyone as the perpetrator of the offences. 
        
        
       3. He had no motive to commit the offences. 
        
        
       4. There was no forensic evidence which linked the appellant with the scene of the crime. 
        
        
       5. The evidence of confession was given by Mr Eyles. That evidence was flawed. Mr Eyles did not make any statement or complaint about the appellant until 14 months after the offences were committed. There was a history of animosity between the appellant and Mr Eyles and a suggestion that Mr Eyles had skimmed the business in which they were partners of between $30,000 – $40,000 per annum. In order, Counsel said, to re-establish Mr Eyles’ credit evidence was given by Mr Church who said that on one occasion Mr Eyles had said to him words to the effect, “Snow [the appellant] admitted to me that he was with Stevens when they bashed the Edwards’s.” However, Mr Church had also given evidence that on the morning of the crime at approximately 10am he saw the appellant in company with Stevens driving in the direction of McGill Place where the crime was committed. In cross-examination he said that the car was Stevens’s wife’s car, a red car, a Hyundai or Kia or something like that. There was other evidence that Stevens’s wife did not own a red car at the time and that at 10am Stevens was hiring the Camry, which was white, and which was used that night to take him to the scene of the crime. The hiring arrangements were being made by him in Lismore, which was  
        
       25 km from Alstonville.  
       
      
      
       
       As to the blood found on the handle of the child’s baseball bat and on the side of the shoe worn by Stevens when committing the crime, these were reasonably explained by the appellant’s evidence about his cut finger and his visit to Stevens’s house during the afternoon of the crime to buy spinach.  
        
        
       6. Counsel stressed the alibi evidence and particularly that of the appellant’s de facto wife who remembered being home sick with her husband at the time the crime was committed, particularly because, as could be demonstrated by a document produced by the doctor, she had been at a doctor’s surgery on the previous day. It was said that the wife’s evidence was not shaken in cross examination. 
        
        
       7. The appellant gave evidence consistent with his wife’s and was not shaken in cross examination. 
        
        
       8. Mr Stevens gave evidence that the appellant did not take part in the assault. The other assailants, apart from himself, were Shane Campbell and Philip Leadbeater. Leadbeater gave evidence in which he denied he was present and said he was resident in Brisbane at the time. There was some evidence that Stevens had indicated that he was bringing people from Brisbane to join him in the attack on the members of the Edwards family.  
        
        
       Discussion 
        
       
     66 In R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at 87-88, Spigelman CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The respect which the Court pays to the constitutional role of the jury was emphasised in  
         M v The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, in a passage referred to with approval in  
         Jones 
           
         v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 451: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. (Footnotes omitted). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is against this background, that the test for an unreasonable verdict – whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty – must be applied to the whole of the facts and the circumstances of a particular case.” 
         
        
       
     67 To my mind, despite the careful submissions Mr Bellanto put, the attack on the verdict in this case amounts to no more than saying that the Crown’s case – based upon evidence of a confession and evidence of the appellant’s blood on an implement used in the assault and on a shoe worn by one of the assailants – could not safely and beyond reasonable doubt be accepted in preference to the defendant’s denial that he took part in the assault, his alibi supported by his wife’s evidence and an innocent explanation for the presence of his blood. There are indications in the material that we have that Mr Eyles, in the language of the trial Judge on sentence, showed a degree of malice towards the offender which raised a question as to whether his evidence could be trusted. Again, to use the trial Judge’s language when sentencing, it was a puzzling feature of the case as to how and why the appellant, a man with no previous history of violence or dishonesty, became involved in committing such crimes. Mr Bellanto pointed out that the jury retired at 12.38pm on 28 September 2001 and returned with their verdict at 2.06pm that same afternoon, suggesting a less careful consideration of the evidence than the case required. 
      
       
     68 On the other hand the Crown referred to the curious fact, according to Mr McFadden’s evidence, that after the appellant arrived at the bakery sometime after 1am on the morning after the crimes were committed, Mrs Stevens rang and asked to speak to the appellant. On one account they spoke together on the telephone for approximately 10-15 minutes. The appellant recalled that Mr McFadden answered the telephone. The appellant said that Mrs Stevens told him Colin had been arrested and that his youngest son, Brodie, wouldn’t be at the football “tomorrow because of what had happened to Col”. 
      
       
     69 The jury heard the evidence of these witnesses and saw them give it. Mr Bellanto did not press any submission suggesting fault in the learned trial Judge’s summing up. The appellant’s counsel did not seek any redirection. In my opinion the appellant’s grounds of appeal have not been made out. Upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. I would grant the appellant an extension of time up to and including the date of the filing of the notice of appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.

     1 ADAMS J: The appellant was convicted on 10 April 2001 in the District Court at Griffith for an offence of robbery with corporal violence under s95 of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown case was, in some respects, a simple one but was complicated because one of the important Crown witnesses gave evidence contradicting the account of the alleged victim, Mr Pendlebury, in several vital respects. 
      
       
     2 Before dealing with the Crown appeal it is useful to set out briefly the evidence in the case. During the evening of Friday 14 April 2000, Mr Pendlebury attended the Area Hotel in Griffith. His evidence was to the following effect. He arrived at about 8pm and left the hotel before closing time, which he thought was about 12 midnight. While at the hotel he drank beer and spirits. After leaving the Area Hotel he went on to the Crown Hotel where he consumed more alcohol. Again, he left that hotel before closing time which he thought was 3am. After leaving the hotel, he walked in a westerly direction along a street named Banna Avenue towards the police station. As he was walking, he heard people behind him yelling and, turning around, he saw a man and a woman. He kept walking to the end of the block. The woman, (whom he said was the appellant} came up behind him and yelled out “Cowboy” and, when Mr Pendlebury turned around, asked if he would walk her home to her place. Mr Pendlebury agreed. They walked for some little distance and then the appellant stopped at some units outside which were two people. As it happened, although this was not known to Mr Pendlebury, the appellant lived in one of the units in this building. Mr Pendlebury said that a conversation took place with the appellant and the two other persons for three minutes or so. He was about three metres away and did not hear what was being said. The appellant then walked over to him and said, “Let’s go, we have to go this way”. The two of them walked along the lane for a short time through a car park, across the street and into the grounds of the TAFE College. He said that the woman was a short distance behind him and to the right and that he saw her out of his peripheral vision. After they had gone about five metres into the grounds, Mr Pendlebury felt a sharp blow to the back of his head and fell to the ground, face first. He was robbed. It only took a short time and, shortly after his assailant left him, he got up, brushed himself off and walked home. The evidence does not disclose where he lived at the time and it was, therefore, at least reasonably possible that his way home would have led him through the grounds of the TAFE college at all events. Mr Pendlebury suffered a black eye, a cut above his left eye and a lump and bruising behind his left ear and sore shoulders.  
      
       
     3 Mr Pendlebury reported the incident to the police on the following Monday. He said he did not report the assault immediately as, “I wanted to clear my head which was aching”. He added, he felt very sore. He further added he did not want to make a scene as he was only in town a short time but then decided to report the crime because it might happen to other people. As he was taking the police to the scene of the offence he took them past the units where he had stopped on the night he was attacked. A man and a woman were sitting out the front and Mr Pendlebury identified the woman as the person whom he was accompanying into the grounds of the TAFE college when he was attacked. She was arrested and denied any involvement in the offence. I will come to her account shortly. 
      
       
     4 The Crown case was that she had lured the victim into the TAFE grounds so an accomplice could rob him. In the circumstances, the extent, if any, to which Mr Pendlebury was affected by alcohol was an important issue. In cross examination he said that he thought that he drank about three middies an hour for about three hours and then moved on to half nips of spirits, drinking about three or four. Mr Pendlebury said that he was moderately affected by alcohol but certainly not staggering around. He said that he was a shearer but did not drink “much and hard...because its very hard to shear with a hangover”. Nevertheless it seems to me that the amount of drinking to which he admitted was considerable. He described the appellant’s clothing on the night in question, saying that she was not wearing any shoes. It appeared that Mr Pendlebury’s evidence had differed in some respects from his account to the police, but not in substance. This is not, however, to say that the jury were not entitled to take the differences into account in evaluating his evidence. Although, as it seems to me, they were peripheral, they were not trivial or insignificant and required to be seriously evaluated.  
      
       
     5 The Crown also called Ms Katie MacDonald, who was a friend of the appellant and had been in her company at the Crown Hotel. She said that at about 3am the appellant left the hotel to visit a friend and Ms MacDonald went to the appellant’s home. The lights were off so she sat on the front brick fence to wait. She said that about ten minutes later the appellant arrived with two friends named Eddie and Dan. They all went inside and talked for about an hour. Dan then left. Two other male friends then arrived. The appellant and Eddie then left the unit to get another drink and Ms MacDonald and one of the other men, Billie, went outside to wait for them. Ms MacDonald said that about 5am the appellant came walking back from Banna Avenue in the company of a man wearing jeans and a cowboy hat. There is no doubt that this was Mr Pendlebury. The two of them walked up to Ms MacDonald and Billie. The appellant said to Ms MacDonald, “You don’t let strangers into your house, do you?” Ms MacDonald said to Mr Pendlebury, “I don’t let strangers into my house, so I suggest you leave”. The man stayed for about five minutes whilst the other three had a conversation. He was about a metre away. After that he walked up Banna Avenue towards the main street. The appellant remained and spoke to Ms MacDonald for about half an hour. Ms MacDonald said that she was asked to make a statement, presumably by the police, about a fortnight after the night in question. It is obvious that, on the assumption that she was talking about the night of the attack on Mr Pendlebury, Ms MacDonald’s evidence and his cannot be reconciled. It was never suggested that she had made such a mistake. The jury, therefore, could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied, in substance, that Ms MacDonald had fabricated her evidence. Furthermore, as a practical matter, she must have been suborned in some way by the appellant. It is possible to imagine other scenarios that might account for the stark contradiction between her evidence and that of Mr Pendlebury, the essence of which must be either that she was mistaking the events she was describing as having occurred on another night or that she had forgotten that the appellant accompanied Mr Pendlebury after she had asked him to leave and returned a short time later. For obvious reasons, these possibilities are very unlikely. It is evident, therefore, that in order to succeed, the Crown needed to invite the jury to disbelieve Ms MacDonald and to put before the jury a basis upon which they could disbelieve her. There was no cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor of Ms MacDonald to suggest in any way that she was either mistaken, or lying. In the light of that I am somewhat at a loss to see how the prosecutor could properly have put to the jury that it should not accept her evidence. It may have been thought that Ms MacDonald was a friend of the appellant. The appellant said however, that since the night in question the relationship had soured and it is evident from Ms MacDonald’s cross-examination that she would not agree easily, or at all, to a number of suggestions which may have been important put to her by the appellant’s counsel. 
      
       
     6 At the close of the Crown case, counsel for the appellant applied for a verdict of acquittal by direction. That application was refused. Defence counsel then sought a Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161; 2 A Crim R 45 direction. This was given in conventional terms but the jury wished to continue. The appellant then gave evidence. She said she commenced drinking in the late afternoon of the day in question. She started in her unit and was in the company of Ms MacDonald. She could not recall what she had drunk. In the early evening she went to the Victoria Hotel and, sometime before it closed at midnight, she moved to the Crown Hotel, probably staying until 3am, when it closed. She had been drinking steadily and was, she said, heavily intoxicated. She said she was with a friend, Jane, and went with her to a nearby taxi stand where Jane caught a taxi. She walked up Banna Avenue. She was wearing black pants and top and shoes.  
      
       
     7 The appellant walked to her home in Banna Lane and stayed there for a while, but could not remember what she did or how long she stayed before she left and went to a telephone box in Banna Avenue to call a girlfriend. She was still very drunk and thought that she was calling to ask for some cigarettes and more alcohol. The appellant thought it was about 4.30am. The number was engaged and the call did not get through. The appellant then noticed Mr Pendlebury, whom she did not know, walking towards her. At the same time she noticed a friend of hers driving past. I assume she may have, on the defence case, been the person who called out “Cowboy” to Mr Pendlebury. The appellant said that she had a conversation with Mr Pendlebury but could not recall the details. The two then walked up Banna Avenue and a car pulled up next to them. She did not know the occupants but noticed Mr Pendlebury at the front passenger’s window. The appellant then said she was leaving and started to walk towards her home. She said that Mr Pendlebury followed her a little way behind. She said that she saw Ms MacDonald and Billie outside an asked Ms MacDonald, in effect, to pretend that it was her unit and “tell the bloke following me where to go”. She said that Ms MacDonald swore at him abusively to go. She said that the man then staggered off and that was the last she saw of him that night. The three persons at the unit then talked for about half an hour before Ms MacDonald left and Billie “passed out in my unit”.  
      
       
     8 The appellant was cross examined as to some relatively minor discrepancies in her account. Significantly, as it seems to me, it was not suggested that her evidence differed from what she said to the police or that she had attempted to influence Ms MacDonald in the evidence that she gave. She was asked if Ms MacDonald was a friend of hers and said that the relationship had “sort of soured” over the eleven months since her arrest. 
      
       
     9 The appellant called evidence of a good character from a family friend who had known her since early childhood although it is fair to say that during cross-examination it appeared that the witness was not intimately acquainted with her. In the circumstances of this case the evidence of that character witness was capable of being very significant. 
      
       
     10 Following counsel’s addresses his Honour commenced to tell the jury about the summing up but interrupted after a couple of sentences to state that he had just been handed a question which the court officer got from one of the jurors. His Honour said - 
      
       
        
         
         “What I propose to do is just ask the author of that note to mark time for the moment until I finish what I am about to say”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       His Honour then said that he was going to adjourn his summing up until following the luncheon adjournment which was impending. His Honour then added this -  
        
        
         
         “May I suggest to you in the first instance, however, that you adjourn. Don’t go straight to lunch now but the juror who wrote the note, I’ll pass the note back to the forelady and that note can be discussed in the jury room, if you like. I suppose you’d better come back into the courtroom when you’ve discussed the note and when the juror has had the opportunity to communicate his views to the rest of you, you can come back into the courtroom or in advance of that send me a note if you want some problem resolved, you can come back into the courtroom and I’ll resolve the problem if I can in the light of whatever note you’ve sent me”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The jury then left the court room and his Honour said to counsel - 
        
        
         
         “I don’t know if that note is going to come back. I didn’t make a note or a copy of it, but it is along the lines of, and here I’m seeking to quote it, have a problem with the evidence of the last witness. We’ll wait to get a communication from the jury before I sent them out to lunch.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       There was a short adjournment and his Honour then announced, in the absence of the jury - 
        
        
         
         “The Court Officer tells me that the jury have not handed him a note. They’ve told him that they’re resolved whatever was concerning them and they’re ready to come back to court.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       When the jury returned his Honour said - 
        
        
         
         “Members of the jury, the message I’ve received from the Court Officer is that you don’t have a note for me or any questions and that you’ve resolved the matter by discussion in the jury room. Madam Foreman, does that accurately represent the situation?” 
          
         
        
       The foreperson replied, “Yes, it is”.  
        
       
     11 It is most unfortunate that his Honour took the unconventional step of not showing the note to counsel and having it marked for identification, which is the invariable practice in the courts of this State. However, relying on his Honour’s recollection of its contents, to my mind it raised the real risk that the juror was not so much concerned with the evidence of the last witness, who was the character witness, but may have wished to communicate something about the witness herself. After all, the trial was taking place in a country town and the accused’s mother owned, or managed, a shop in the town, with the character witness saying that she was a close family friend. In the circumstances, however, his Honour, as I have mentioned, sent the note back and directed the jury to it. It is impossible to know what was discussed. There was a very real risk that what was sought to be conveyed was not merely a query about the evidence of the witness but something about the witness herself, the distinction being one I think unlikely to be made by a lay person. Regrettably neither counsel sought to assist his Honour in prudently disposing of the problem that had arisen. This problem is exacerbated by his Honour’s directions about character. His Honour said - 
      
       
        
         
         “The alleged offender, however, is entitled to rely on the fact that she is a person of previous good character, as making it less likely that she would have committed the offence. If there is any room for doubt her good character may be taken into account by you in her favour. You should bear the evidence of good character as a factor affecting the likelihood of her having committed the crime of which she is charged. You should consider her previous good character in assessing the credibility of the explanation she has given to you about the events on this particular night. The real question for you is whether you are prepared, notwithstanding her good character, to find the facts as the Crown has asked you to find, proved against her”.  
         
        
       
     12 It was, I think, unfortunate that his Honour used the phrase “previous good character” as it may have implied to the jury that her character was then in question and that the fact that she had been charged was a matter which gave rise to a doubt about her character. However, if this had been the only difficulty with the direction I would not have thought it probable this would have amounted to a miscarriage. The next sentence, however, was a serious misdirection. The very point about good character is that, in an appropriate case, it may itself create the doubt that requires a verdict of acquittal. If, absent evidence of good character, there be room for doubt then acquittal must follow at all events. 
      
       
     13 Having regard to the events concerning the note of the juror, the question of character evidence was highlighted and it seems to me that, especially if one has regard to that to which I have drawn attention, the problem associated with the note must lead to the conclusion that the trial miscarried. 
      
       
     14 I have mentioned that the offence charged was robbery with corporal violence. It is a necessary element of the offence, so far as guilt of an accessory is concerned, that the Crown establish either that there was an agreement implicit or explicit between the actual assailant and the accused to commit violence or else that the accused had adverted to the possibility of violence and nevertheless decided to continue in the enterprise. That this subjective understanding is an element of the offence was made clear, if it had not been clear before, in R v McAuliffe (1995) 79 A Crim R 229. Regrettably, his Honour’s directions invited the jury to consider only whether there was an agreement between the accused and the assailant to rob. A robbery, of course, is, in law, committed if there is a mere threat of violence, and it is not a necessary element of the crime that actual violence occur. 
      
       
     15 In my view the omission in the directions identifying for the jury the elements of the particular offence, especially in circumstances where it was far from inevitable that, even if the appellant was indeed present at the scene of the robbery with knowledge that a robbery was intended, she had not considered, having regard to the state of intoxication, that corporal violence may have been a possibility. This failure also caused the trial to miscarry.  
      
       
     16 I would propose, therefore, that the conviction be quashed. 
      
       
     17 The Crown submits that the Court should order a new trial. It is obvious from what I have already said that this was far from a strong Crown case. There was an obvious explanation left open on the evidence for Mr Pendlebury being in the TAFE grounds when he was attacked. Whether or not he fabricated his evidence is not necessary, of course, to determine but confabulation, in the likely state of his inebriety is one reasonable possibility. In these circumstances I do not think that the court should order a new trial and I propose that a verdict of acquittal should be substituted. 
      
       
     18 SHELLER JA: I agree. 
      
       
     19 HIDDEN J: I also agree. On the question of whether a new trial should be ordered, I would also have regard to the fact this was an exceptional case where ultimately the appellant was granted the benefit of a non custodial sentence. 
      
       
     20 SHELLER JA: The order of the court will be the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is directed.

      R v Scott Geoffrey WILSON 
       
      
      
       
     The appellant was charged under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act), first, that he did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine (in contravention of s24 of the Act) and secondly that he did cultivate cannabis plants (in contravention of s23(1)(a) of the Act). The appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges, but was convicted on both by Judge Goldring without a jury. 
      
       
     The appellant appealed from his conviction on each count. 
      
       
     The appellant was arrested after the execution of two search warrants on his premises which discovered items which had been used in a step in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Also discovered were 87 cannabis plants. 
      
       
     While the Crown case depended largely on circumstantial evidence, the trial Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that his premises were being used for the purpose of manufacturing a prohibited drug. The trial Judge was unwilling to infer that the appellant was actually participating in the manufacture of amphetamines on his premises. As to the second charge, the trial Judge was satisfied that the appellant had nurtured or tended the cannabis plants found in his premises. 
      
       
     At trial the appellant did not give evidence or call any evidence, but an alternative hypothesis to explain the presence of the items was advanced on his behalf. The appellant claimed that the step in manufacture took place off the appellant's premises and the premises were used merely to store the materials and implements of manufacture.  
      
       
     It was argued on appeal that the trial Judge had erred by regarding it as appropriate to discuss alternative reasonable hypotheses inconsistent with the appellant's guilt of the offences charged. The appellant contended that the verdict was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. It was further argued that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory and lead to a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     In respect of the second charge, the appellant's counsel submitted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the appellant had tended or nurtured the cannabis plants found on the premises. As such, the verdict was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence.HELD (per Sheller JA, Bell J and Carruthers AJ concurring) 
      
       
     1. If there was a rational inference or reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with the appellant's guilt it was not open to the trial Judge to convict the appellant on some other rational inference or reasonable hypothesis which pointed to the appellant's guilt: see Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234. While the trial Judge did not correctly express the above principle, his treatment of the circumstantial evidence the Crown relied on demonstrated that the correct approach was taken. The Court was satisfied that the trial Judge accepted and proceeded on the basis that he could not convict if there was a reasonable hypothesis available which explained the distribution of the various items found on the premises and was inconsistent with the appellant's guilt. 
      
       
     2. The Court did not accept the appellant's contention that the trial Judge had failed to give reasons and hence to comply with section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 applied. 
      
       
     3. The evidence to which the trial Judge referred left it open to him to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the identified step in manufacture took place in the appellant's premises and to reject the hypothesis that manufacture had taken place elsewhere and the appellant's premises were used only for storage as a reasonable hypothesis. See the statements of Dawson J in Shephard v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579-80. 
      
       
     4. The appeal on the conviction for the second charge could not be sustained. The presence of fertiliser and evidence of the healthy condition of the cannabis plants when they were found indicated they had received reasonable amounts of light, regular watering and a nutrient supply. There was ample evidence for the trial Judge to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had tended and nurtured the plants by watering and fertilising them.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: The appellant, Scott Geoffrey Wilson, was charged first that on or before 4 October 2000 at Bulli he did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine and secondly that on or before 4 October 2000 at Bulli he did cultivate a prohibited plant namely cannabis plants.  
      
       
     2 The first charge was laid under s24 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). Section 6 of the Act provides that for the purposes of the Act a person takes part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, inter alia, (a) if the person takes or participates in any step in the process of manufacture or (c) suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the occupier. Section 3 of the Act provides that manufacture includes the process of extracting or refining the prohibited drug. 
      
       
     3 The second charge was laid under s23(1)(a) of the Act. Section 3 of the Act provides that cultivate includes tending or nurturing. 
      
       
     4 The appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. The trial proceeded before Judge Goldring without a jury on 20 and 21 February 2002. For reasons given on 21 February 2002 his Honour convicted the appellant on both charges.  
      
       
     5 On 19 April 2002 his Honour imposed sentences, on the first charge, of imprisonment for twelve months to date from 7 June 2002 with a non-parole period of nine months to be served by way of home detention and, on the second charge, imprisonment for a fixed term of two months to date from 7 June 2002 to be served by way of home detention. 
      
       
     6 The appellant appeals from his conviction on each count.  
      
       
       The Crown Case 
        
       
     7 In summary the Crown case was as follows. The police executed a search warrant on 4 October 2000 at premises occupied by the appellant at 21 Coleman’s Lane Bulli. They found the appellant at home with Matthew Clements, Melissa Tickle and Shane Evans. The four people were seated around a coffee table. On the table there was a small bowl of cannabis in a dried and shredded form. The appellant told the police that he was going to take it fishing and give it to other people to smoke.  
      
       
     8 Matthew Clements refused to be interviewed by the police. Melissa Tickle gave evidence that she had never been to the premises before and had not taken any of her personal items into the house. Shane Evans said that he had been at the house before. On that day he was there to go fishing with the appellant. He gave evidence that he had left his fishing gear outside. He had never left any other possessions at the house. 
      
       
     9 The house premises consisted of two bedrooms, one occupied by the appellant, a kitchen, a lounge room and a sunroom. In the backyard were two caravans and a tin shed.  
      
       
     10 During this first search the police found in the appellant’s bedroom a bottle labelled and containing methylated spirits and two plastic bags each containing a polyethylene suit for use in handling hazardous chemicals which, the appellant told police, he used to protect his clothing while fishing and had obtained from a person he knew who worked at the Steelworks. There was no evidence that either of the suits had been used in any way.  
      
       
     11 In the sunroom the police found a glass vessel described in the evidence by an expert chemical analyst, Mr Peter Ballard, as a separating flask for use in the reaction phase of the manufacture of amphetamines. The appellant told police during the search that his son had brought the flask home from school and the appellant had confiscated it to return to the school. The flask was not concealed in any way. 
      
       
     12 In the other bedroom which the appellant told police belonged to nobody, were found opened packets of Sudafed, car radios and other items. The appellant said that this room had been used by a person called Peter Champion. 
      
       
     13 In the backyard the police found 87 cannabis plants on a green plastic tray lying on a brick structure like an incinerator or barbeque. The appellant said that these plants belonged to Peter Champion who had left owing rent. The appellant understood that he was coming back to pick the plants up. He denied that he looked after the plants. There was also a disassembled motorbike in the yard said to belong to Peter Champion.  
      
       
     14 Richard Hawkins, a horticulturist called by the Crown, gave evidence from photographs shown to him that the plants were in good condition and must have been supplied with nutrients and water. The police also found two plastic containers of fertiliser suitable for use in the hydroponic cultivation of plants. 
      
       
     15 Senior Constable Hyndes gave evidence that he unsuccessfully searched the Roads and Traffic Authority records, the COPS database and the electoral roll for a Peter Champion who had lived in the Wollongong area.  
      
       
     16 From under the tin shed in the backyard the police removed a 20 litre drum labelled as containing methylated spirits. On analysis the drum was found to contain residues of not only ethanol but paracetamol and pseudoephedrine. In the corner of the shed in a cardboard box an Ohaus machine was discovered. The appellant admitted that he went into the shed nearly every day and he knew that the box was there but he did not know what was in it. Mr Ballard gave evidence that this machine could be used as electronic scales and could also be used to remove moisture from substances placed on its plate. On analysis the plate was found to contain traces of methylamphetamine, pseudoephedrine and cannabis extracts. 
      
       
     17 At the time of the execution of the search warrants, Ms Valerie Connelly was residing in one of the caravans. In that caravan under the seat in a compartment the police located several freezer bags containing hundreds of tablets which were later identified as Sudafed or a tablet of a similar chemical composition. There were also two 3 litre milk containers both of which contained a residue of pseudoephedrine and ethanol and a rectangular 4 litre container which contained a residue of pseudoephedrine and paracetamol. There was also a bottle of methylated spirits. The other caravan was searched but no items were seized from it. 
      
       
     18 Later in the day a second search warrant was executed in the presence of police from a specialist drug unit. This time in the second caravan a pair of children’s tracksuit pants, which had obviously been used as a rag, was confiscated and subjected to analysis. The pants were found to contain traces of methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine. 
      
       
     19 Mr Ballard explained one method of manufacturing methylamphetamine. This involved the extraction of pseudoephedrine from commercially available tablets such as Sudafed or Codral by crushing the tablets and immersing them in an alcohol such as methylated spirits which caused the pseudoephedrine to go into solution. It could then be extracted. Before methylamphetamine could be produced a further process was required, known as a reaction process, where the pseudoephedrine was placed in an apparatus with a re-agent, heat applied and the fumes condensed to produce a methylamphetamine oil. That oil could then be solidified. The Crown case was that the process of extracting pseudoephedrine from tablets using methylated spirits took place at the premises. This was established by the presence of a large number of tablets of the Sudafed type, the various containers of methylated spirits and the various containers showing residue consistent with the production of pseudoephedrine. 
      
       
     20 Ms Connelly gave evidence. She came to be occupying the caravan as a result of her relationship with the appellant’s father. She had moved in about two months before the execution of the search warrant. She said that she never went into the house or into the other caravan. She gave evidence that the caravan was fitted with a lock but that she never had a key and did not lock the caravan from the outside. 
      
       
     21 Ms Connelly testified that she had looked all over the caravan, including the compartment seat whilst staying there and had never found anything. She also said that she had never seen the appellant enter the other caravan. The witness had made a prior inconsistent statement. The Crown obtained leave under s38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine her. In her prior statement dated 6 June 2001 Ms Connelly had said that she had never looked in the compartment seats of the caravan. She had also said that she had seen the appellant entering the other caravan every day and sometimes, more often than not, several times a day. She had been told never to enter into the other van. 
      
       
     22 The Crown conceded in relation to this witness that her extensive psychiatric record, history of alcohol and drug abuse and her own admission that she had provided sexual favours in return for the supply of amphetamines made her evidence unreliable and a warning under s165 of the Evidence Act was appropriate. 
      
       
     23 The appellant neither called any evidence nor gave any evidence himself. 
      
       
        
       Reasons for Judgment 
        
       
     24 In his reasons for judgment of 21 February 2002 Judge Goldring said that the case depended very largely on circumstantial evidence. He said that the onus of proof was and remained on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt as to every essential ingredient of each of the charges. The trial Judge observed that he must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other reasonable explanation for those facts upon which the Crown asked him to infer that the accused was guilty of each of the two offences charged than that of the accused’s guilt.  
      
       
     25 Referring to the expert witnesses, Mr Ballard and Mr Hawkins, his Honour noted that it was open to him to reject any expert evidence or to accept it and that he must not draw any inference adverse to the accused because he exercised his right to remain silent and not to give evidence.  
      
       
     26 Next the trial Judge turned to the ingredients of the particular offences and set out the relevant provisions of the Act. There was no issue that methylamphetamine was a prohibited drug and cannabis plants prohibited plants. He summarised the Crown case on the first charge as follows. The Crown alleged that 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Scott Wilson, knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, … because he participated in the extraction of pseudoephedrine from commercially available tablets … pseudoephedrine is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Alternatively it says if Mr Wilson did not himself take part in that process he was the occupier of premises where that process did take part [sic] and he knew that the premises were being used for that purpose.” 
         
        
       
     27 As to the second charge the trial Judge said that the Crown alleged that Mr Wilson nurtured or tended the 87 odd plants that were found in his premises. 
      
       
     28 Judge Goldring referred to the evidence of Ms Connolly, the occupant of one of the caravans in the backyard, a caravan that, according to the appellant, the appellant owned. She had a close relationship with the appellant’s father Geoffrey Wilson. The Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Scott Wilson told the police that his father was helping a woman who was in trouble by allowing her to occupy the caravan and Ms Connelly confirmed that. It was conceded in the course of the trial that Ms Connelly, who is an unfortunate person and who undoubtedly was in trouble at this time, is affected by a number of conditions. She has been a psychiatric patient since 1990 when she was twenty-four; she suffers from auditory hallucinations; she has been or is addicted to drugs including heroin and amphetamines; she suffers from depression; she has suffered from drug induced psychosis; she has misused prescribed medication; she has abused alcohol; she has episodes of paranoia; she has been diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder and in the past there are episodes when she has provided sexual favours to those who have supplied her with drugs, particularly amphetamines. It is conceded that on that basis, as well as the relationship with the accused’s father, I should be cautious of her evidence and indeed because of her history of drug related and medical problems I must regard her evidence as unreliable and if that were the only evidence of the accused it would be dangerous for me to convict on that basis. As it turns out, Ms Connelly’s evidence is not the principal evidence relied upon by the Crown 
         .” 
         
        
       
     29 The trial Judge referred to the searches and the evidence of two of the three people (Mr Evans and his girlfriend, Ms Tickle) the police found with the appellant when they arrived at the premises at about 10 am on 4 October 2000. The fourth person present, Mr Clements, did not give evidence. Senior Constable Hyndes said that Mr Clements had declined to be interviewed by the police or to give a statement.  
      
       
     30 Ms Tickle’s evidence was that she and Mr Evans had gone to the premises. It was the first time she had been there. She did not use cannabis. She did not like it. She did not take anything there with her. She said that Mr Evans had taken his fishing tackle with him, which he corroborated. Mr Evans said he had known the appellant for some time and had been fishing with him in the past. The trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “On this occasion he intended to go fishing and had brought his fishing gear which he left outside when he entered through the back door. However, he did not bring anything else with him and he did not consider himself a regular visitor to Mr Wilson’s house. There is no doubt, in my view, that Mr Wilson is keen on fishing, that was his evidence, it was Mr Evans’ evidence, it was what Mr Wilson said to the police... And in the videotape there are obviously a number of fishing rods stored in the house. 
         
        
        
         
         The four people who were in the house when the police arrived were seated around a coffee table and on that table there was a small bowl containing a small amount of cannabis in a dried and shredded form ready for smoking together with the bong. Mr Wilson told the police that he was going to take that with him fishing and give it to other people who would smoke it. Very little turns on that.” 
         
        
       
     31 The trial Judge referred to the video tape of the search and the various things found by the police which I have already described. His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “There were in the refrigerator some fresh food items. Ms Connelly gave evidence and was not challenged on this point that she did keep food items in that fridge and indeed that these items were often provided for her by Mr Geoffrey Wilson. She gave evidence that the caravan was fitted with a lock but that she never had a key and did not lock the caravan from the outside. She said she thought she had seen Geoffrey Wilson lock it from the outside on one occasion but as far as she was concerned she did not lock it. She said that she had occupied this caravan for about two months before the search warrant was executed and for about six weeks afterwards. She did not ever go inside the house and she used a toilet block at the beach when she needed to go to the toilet. She moved out of the caravan when she obtained a flat which was more comfortable and warmer.” 
         
        
       
     32 The trial Judge said the contents of the 20 litre drum labelled as containing methylated spirits was analysed and found to contain residues of not only ethanol but paracetamol and pseudoephedrine. He referred to the Ohaus machine and on analysis the finding that the pan of this device contained traces not only of methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine but also of cannabis extracts. The Judge continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the laundry at the rear of the house, when a second search warrant was executed later that afternoon, police including not only the police who had conducted the original search but police from a specialist drug unit who had been called in, found a length of black hose.” 
         
        
       
     33 The trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Wilson’s evidence, or what he told the police and what I must conclude from the evidence before me is that he was the only permanent adult occupant of this premises. He did have a girlfriend called Lee Buckley who was there from time to time and who was actually on the premises at the time of the execution of the second search warrant in the afternoon. She did not give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Ms Connelly gave evidence that she was there at times. Mr Wilson said that he lived there with his son who was aged seven and Ms Connelly confirmed that. There were some items found in the course of the search which were consistent with this.” 
         
        
       
     34 After describing the method of manufacture, his Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
         The Crown does not allege that the whole of the process took place on Mr Wilson’s premises. It does however allege that the process of extracting pseudoephedrine from tablets using methylated spirits did take place there and that this is the only explanation for the presence of large numbers of tablets of the Sudafed type, of containers of methylated spirits and of a number of containers showing residue consistent with the production of pseudoephedrine. Indeed, some of the items seized on analysis showed traces of methylamphetamine itself.” 
         
        
       
     35 Reiterating that the case was a “circumstantial case” and stating that the only corroborative evidence which, in view of the warning that he had given, could not be of significant value but might be of some value was that of Ms Connelly. The trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Here, the relevant evidence is that she had firstly not examined the caravan where the items were found during the execution of the search warrant although in her evidence in court she said that she had explored the caravan thoroughly and I am asked to treat that inconsistency as effecting the worth of her evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         The other thing that she said in court, which contradicted a prior statement given to the police, was that she had never seen anyone going into the other caravan, whereas she had told police that she had seen Scott, meaning the accused, and other people going into this caravan on a number of occasions. As I say that statement is corroborative. It would not in my view justify by itself any finding of the accused’s guilt.” 
         
        
       
     36 The Crown listed various things that the appellant had said to the police in the course of the execution of the search warrant which were untrue and, it was submitted, were statements made in order to escape blame. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The first was that the cannabis on the table was to be used when the accused and his friends went fishing. I cannot be convinced that that was an untruth. At least I cannot be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that that was an untruth. He also said that the chemical protection suits were intended by him to be used to protect his clothing when he went fishing and I cannot be satisfied that this could in any sense or on any rational basis be said to be true. It is a highly unlikely use for these garments. 
         
        
       
     37 After passing reference to the presence of Peter Champion, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I am not satisfied of the truth of those statements, a matter which I will consider, the Crown says that I should find that that is an untruth from which I can conclude that the accused told those lies because he was conscious of his guilt. The defence argued in my view convincingly, that clearly on these premises were a number of items which Mr Wilson knew or should have known were either illegal or closely related to activities which were criminal.” 
         
        
        
       The trial Judge was not satisfied that the only reason the appellant told lies was that he was conscious of his guilt of the particular offences charged.  
        
       
     38 Judge Goldring said he could not draw an inference that the appellant was actually participating in the manufacture of amphetamines on his premises. Accordingly, his Honour said he would concentrate on the use of the appellant’s premises. 
      
       
        
         
         “The defence put forward a number of alternative hypotheses to the knowing participation of Mr Wilson in the manufacture of amphetamines by allowing his premises to be used. I emphasise that this is an offence which requires knowledge. Knowledge, of course, can be inferred from circumstances and actions and that is what the Crown asks me to do in this case. The alternative hypotheses which the defence says I might find would reasonably explain the presence of all these items in the premises relate to the possibility that Valerie Connelly, or someone associated by her, placed some or all of the items on Mr Wilson’s premises; that Mr Geoffrey Wilson placed the items there; or that Peter Champion did and I should say something about each of those alternatives.” 
         
        
       
     39 The trial Judge regarded it as significant that not all the items found by the police when they executed the search warrant were found in the caravan occupied by Ms Connelly. Some were found in the shed, in the laundry and in the house. All of these items were ones used commonly in the extraction of pseudoephedrine from tablets. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The protective clothing is at least consistent with the conduct of a laboratory of some sort. The methylated spirits, while having a perfectly innocent explanation if found in isolation, when found in conjunction with other items loses that innocence. The presence of the 20 litre drum under the shed is significant in my view. The Ohaus machine may be something that had been placed in the shed some time before and may not necessarily be used to Mr Wilson’s knowledge in the manufacture of amphetamines. He did know that the carton containing it was in the shed but said that he did not know what it contained. The evidence of Mr Ballard was that the apparatus, like the separation funnel, was an item used in the processes of manufacture of amphetamines which is not suggested took place on Mr Wilson’s premises [sic]. However, the fact that such items were found on the premises goes, the Crown says, to complete a series of coincidental findings of items from which I should deduce that part of the process of manufacturing of amphetamines was taking place on those premises.” 
         
        
       
     40 His Honour dealt with each of the hypotheses he had set out. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I am to accept the Crown case I must find that each of the three hypotheses which the defence has put forward as possible alternatives are not reasonable and  
         that indeed any other hypothesis which is reasonable can be dismissed.  
         [emphasis added] Ms Connelly denied that she knew of the presence in the van occupied by her of any of the items which the police found. She did say that she knew a number of people who supplied amphetamine and indeed it would be difficult to imagine that she did not. It is possible that someone that she knew may have been admitted by her to the caravan. If all the items in question had been found in the caravan that hypothesis would be a reasonable one but because other items were found in other parts of the premises it seems to me that that is not a reasonable hypothesis. 
         
        
        
         
         Similarly in respect of Mr Geoffrey Wilson, who certainly had access to the caravan, there was virtually no evidence in this trial that he was involved in any illegal activity. The only evidence was the evidence of Ms Connelly about which there are a number of caveats, but there was no evidence that he had regular access to the premises or access to the inside of the house or the shed or the other caravan. So I find that the possibility that Mr Wilson placed all the items in the premises is not a reasonable hypothesis. 
         
        
        
         
         When the police searched the premises Mr Wilson told them on a number of occasions that items belonged to Peter Champion. Senior Constable Hyndes gave evidence that he searched the Roads and Traffic Authority records, the COPS database and the electoral roll. He found a number of people called Peter Champion but none who lived in the Wollongong area. No evidence was given about when Mr Champion lived in the premises. Mr Wilson did not tell the police in the course of the execution of the search warrant at what time Champion was said to have lived in the premises. Connelly, who had been a resident of these premises for three and a half months over this period denied that anyone other than Wilson and herself [sic] and occasionally Wilson’s girlfriend stayed in the house and Evans who said that he had known Mr Wilson for some time did not know him. There is, in my view, not sufficient evidence on which to formulate a reasonable hypothesis that Peter Champion had placed any items in the van or indeed any where else on the premises.” 
         
        
       
     41 I will return to what the trial Judge next said about the second charge. Immediately following that his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I also find that there is no reasonable hypothesis relating to the  
         position 
           
         [emphasis added] of the various items which clearly are items capable of being used in the manufacture of amphetamines through the extraction of pseudoephedrine from tablets, as a whole in these premises, other than the use of those premises for that purpose and in my view there is no hypothesis which can explain how Mr Wilson could  
         not 
          [emphasis added] have been ignorant of their presence or their use. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knowingly allowed the use of his premises for that purpose.” 
         
        
       
     42 The trial Judge said this about the second charge: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the cannabis the circumstances on which the Crown asks me to infer that Mr Wilson was the person who tended or nurtured the cannabis was basically the condition of the cannabis when it was found and the fact that in the execution of the search warrants the police found two plastic containers of fertiliser used in the hydroponic cultivation of plants. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Hawkins, a horticulturist, was shown photographs of the plants, and indeed I should say that although I am not a horticulturist and not a gardener in any sense it appeared to me from the video that the cannabis plants were in good condition. They were seedlings planted densely in a plastic container and Mr Hawkins gave expert evidence, if such were necessary, that they needed light, water and nutrient. Had the seedlings continued in that environment for long they could not have survived. There was no evidence as to the humidity of the soil when the plants were confiscated but Mr Hawkins said that to be in that condition they required nutrient and water. Mr Wilson was the only full-time adult occupant of these premises and he knew about the presence of the plants. It seems to me that the only reasonable hypothesis I can draw from those facts is that Mr Wilson was the person who tended and nurtured these plants by watering and fertilising.” 
         
        
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     43 The appellant’s grounds of appeal against his conviction were: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Count 1 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 1: The Judge materially misdirected himself as to the applicable law. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 2: The verdict was unreasonable, and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 3: The conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory and, in all the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 1: The findings of fact made by the Judge were incapable of sustaining a verdict of guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 2: The conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory and, in all the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
        
        
       Discussion 
        
        
       The first count 
        
       
     44 In his written submissions, Mr Doris of counsel, who appeared for the appellant both at the trial and on the appeal, argued that the trial Judge had failed to state the elements of the offence and in particular said, correctly, that the first passage in the reasons for judgment which I have emphasised, displayed error. It was suggested that the trial Judge regarded it as appropriate to dismiss alternative reasonable hypotheses inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt of the offence charged.  
      
       
     45 In his well known judgment in Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252, Menzies J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The customary direction where circumstantial evidence is relied upon to prove guilt, that to enable a jury to bring in a verdict of guilty it is necessary not only that it should be a rational inference but the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw, was given.” 
         
        
       
     46 If in this sense there was a rational inference or reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt it was not open to the trial Judge to convict the appellant on some other rational inference or reasonable hypothesis which pointed to his guilt. However, the infelicitous expression his Honour used did not accord with what elsewhere was shown to be his approach to the circumstantial evidence the Crown relied on. He had made it plain at the beginning of his judgment that he had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other reasonable explanation for the facts the Crown asked him to infer than that of the accused’s guilt of the offences charged. At the end of his reasons for judgment he found that there was no reasonable hypothesis relating to the position of the various items clearly capable of being used in the manufacture of amphetamines through the extraction process, other than the use of the premises for that purpose and no hypothesis which could explain how the appellant could have been ignorant of their presence or their use.  
      
       
     47 The last passage of the judgment also contains words which present some difficulty of expression. It was accepted by both the Crown and the appellant that the transcribed phrase “could not have been ignorant” should be read by leaving out the word “not”. However, Mr Doris suggested that the word “position” at the beginning of that paragraph should be read as “possession”. In my opinion, no basis was shown for making this change. Reading the reasons for judgment as a whole I am satisfied that his Honour accepted and proceeded on the basis that he could not convict if there was a reasonable hypothesis available which explained the distribution of the various items found on the premises and was inconsistent with the appellant’s guilt. 
      
       
     48 In his oral submissions, Mr Doris made these points. Judge Goldring was not prepared to draw an inference that the appellant was actually participating in the manufacture of amphetamines on his premises. He therefore, as he said, concentrated on the use of the appellant’s premises. He identified three hypotheses that the defence said would reasonably explain the presence of the various items the police found on the appellant’s premises. The hypotheses were that Ms Connelly or someone associated with her, or the appellant’s father, Mr Geoffrey Wilson, or Mr Champion placed some or all of these items on the appellant’s premises. His Honour rejected each of these hypotheses as a reasonable explanation of the presence of the items found on the appellant’s premises. I did not understand Mr Doris to challenge the trial Judge’s rejection of these hypotheses.  
      
       
     49 The trial Judge regarded it as significant that not all the items found were found in Ms Connelly’s caravan but were dispersed about the premises in the tin shed, the laundry and in the house. They were items commonly used in the extraction of pseudoephedrine from tablets though the glass separating flask found in the sunroom could be used in the reaction phase of the manufacture of amphetamines. The protective clothing was at least consistent with the conduct of a laboratory of some sort. The methylated spirits might be innocently explained if found in isolation, but when found with the other items lost that innocence. In his Honour’s view the presence of the 20 litre drum under the shed was significant. The Ohaus machine had been placed in the shed some time before and might not necessarily be used to the appellant’s knowledge in the manufacture of amphetamines. This, like the separation funnel, could be used in processes of manufacture of amphetamines which the Crown did not claim took place on the appellant’s premises. 
      
       
     50 Ms Connelly denied that she knew of the presence in the van occupied by her of any of the items the police found. His Honour observed that it was possible that someone she knew might have been admitted by her to the caravan and said that if all the items in question had been found in the caravan that hypothesis would be a reasonable one. But because some items were found in other parts of the premises, it was not a reasonable hypothesis. There was little if any evidence that Mr Geoffrey Wilson was involved in any illegal activity. His Honour found that the possibility that Mr Wilson placed all the items in the premises was not a reasonable hypothesis. 
      
       
     51 The only evidence of the presence at any time of Peter Champion on the premises was found in the unsworn recorded remarks of the appellant during the search of the premises. Attempts to find Peter Champion had not succeeded. There was nothing to say when, if ever, he lived in the premises. Ms Connelly, who had resided there for three and a half months over this period, denied that anyone other than the appellant and his girlfriend stayed in the house. Mr Evans did not know Peter Champion. In the trial Judge’s view there was not sufficient evidence to formulate a reasonable hypothesis that a person named Peter Champion had placed any items in the van or indeed anywhere else on the premises. As I have said, Mr Doris did not challenge these findings. 52 Mr Doris challenged the inference which the trial Judge drew that the appellant suffered or permitted the taking of any step in the process of the manufacture of the prohibited drug in the appellant’s premises. At the trial the appellant had advanced the alternative hypothesis that this step in the manufacture took place off the premises and the premises were used merely to store the materials and implements of manufacture. Mr Doris submitted that this was a reasonable alternative hypothesis to which the trial Judge had not referred and which was ignored or rejected without reasons. This was the central plank of the appellant’s appeal against his conviction on the first count. 
      
       
     53 Part 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 concerns the “Disposal of offences”. Section 16 prescribes the occasions when an accused person in criminal proceedings in the District Court must be tried by the Judge alone. Section 17 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Verdict of a single Judge 
         
        
        
         
         (1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.” 
         
        
       
     54 In Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 the High Court at 261 and following said of these sections, then numbered ss 32 and 33 of the Criminal Procedure Act (see the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999, s12) that s17, in any particular case of a trial by a Judge alone, may attract the operation of one or more of the limbs of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In all such cases there will then be the question of the operation of the proviso. The Court said at 262 that the “finding” referred to in s17(1) is not of the same nature as the “findings of fact on which the Judge relied” specified in s17(2). The finding spoken of in s17(1) is one “on the question of the guilt” of the accused and, when made by the Judge, the finding has “the same effect as”, that is to say is of a character that would have been expressed in, “a verdict of a jury”. Accordingly, a finding in the sense specified in s17(1) is a finding of ultimate guilt or otherwise. Their Honours continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “…the first limb of s6(1), which deals with the unsatisfactory quality of ‘the verdict of the jury’, must now be seen through the prism of [s17]. The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing, is that finding ‘unreasonable’ or one which ‘cannot be supported’?” 
         
        
       
     55 The High Court said that whilst they were differently framed, the requirements of s17(2) and (3) were expressed in terms of legal imperatives and a failure to observe either or both of them was to make a wrong decision on a question of law within the second limb of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Such failure might also mean that justice had miscarried, within the meaning of the third limb, because justice according to law, to which the accused was entitled, included compliance with the mandatory requirements of s17. 
      
       
        
         
         “…whilst [s17(2)], when specifying that which a ‘judgment’ must include, does not use the expression ‘reasons for judgment’, it should not be taken as intending that the requirements of [s17(2)] be satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact that the judge has made. Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached.” 
         
        
       
     56 At 263 the Court pointed out that although there might have been a literal compliance with s17(2) the principle of law may have been erroneously formulated thereby disclosing an error of law which attracted at least the second limb of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
      
       
        
         
         “… if the judgment fails to show that the judge applied a relevant principle of law, two possibilities are presented. One possibility is that, notwithstanding such failure, the principle was applied. Upon that hypothesis, there has been a breach of [s17(2)] by reason of the omission from the judgment. The other possibility is that the principle was not applied, with the result that, independently of the question of breach of [s17(2)], there has been an error of law which may attract at least the second limb of s6(1) of the  
         Criminal Appeal Act 
         . The obligation imposed by [s17(2)] was to ensure that the judgment included all principles of law which the judge applied. Unless the judgment shows expressly or by implication that the principle was applied, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied but not recorded. 
         
        
        
         
         Finally, there may be a breach of [s17(3)] with respect to the requirement to take a warning into account. The present appeal is put as such a case. Section [17(3)] is framed in a fashion which differs from that of [s17(2)] and which emphasises the particular importance attached by the legislature to the requirements of the law with respect to warnings. Section [17(2)] requires the inclusion of principles of law applied and of factual findings relied upon, whilst [s17(3)] obliges the judge to take the particular warning into account.” 
         
        
       
     57 Their Honours said that the obligation imposed by s17(3) “to take the warning into account” is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The subsection imposes an obligation which may be discharged by the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the Judge. The failure to give such a warning does not always lead to the setting aside of a conviction. At 264 the Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed by [s17(3)] that the warning be taken into account.” 
         
        
       
     58 At 265 the Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “With respect to the application of the proviso, it has been held in this Court that not every wrong decision on a question of law will lead to the quashing of the conviction or a new trial and that ‘[t]here is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error’ as to preclude the application of the proviso. There may be cases where the failure to satisfy the requirements of [s17] involves errors that are so trivial that the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude that there has been a trial according to law, notwithstanding that failure. However, given the importance of the subject matter of the warning demanded by this case, the miscarriage of justice was a substantial one. This was not a case for the application of the proviso.” 
         
        
       
     59 It is in the sense discussed in the High Court that the appellant contends that there was a failure to give reasons and hence to comply with the obligation imposed by s17 of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, I am not persuaded that there was such a error. His Honour referred to the Crown submission that the fact that the various ingredients and utensils were found on the premises went to “complete a series of coincidental findings of items from which I should deduce that part of the process of manufacturing of amphetamines was taking place on those premises”. Having dealt with the three hypotheses already discussed his Honour, in a passage already quoted, found: 
      
       
        
         
         “there is no reasonable hypothesis relating to the position of the various items which clearly are items capable of being used in the manufacture of amphetamines through the extraction of pseudoephedrine from tablets, as a whole in the premises, other than the use of those premises for that purpose and in my view there is no hypothesis which can explain how Mr Wilson could [not] have been ignorant of their presence or their use. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knowingly allowed the use of his premises for that purpose.” 
         
        
       
     60 As I have already said, no material was put to support a submission that the word “position” was a mis-transcription for the word “possession”. “Position” meaning “location” explains entirely what the Judge had in mind and which he had earlier referred to as being significant, namely that not all the items were found in the caravan occupied by Ms Connelly. Counsel accepted that the contents of the 20 litre drum found under the tin shed and the two 3 litre and the 4 litre containers found in the caravan indicated that the step in manufacture the Crown relied upon had taken place. A pair of children’s track suit pants containing traces of methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine was also found. Whilst making this concession, the appellant’s counsel argued that the presence of these items did not establish that the relevant manufacture had actually taken place on the appellant’s premises. 
      
       
     61 Counsel for the appellant pointed out that although there had been some swabbing none revealed the presence on the walls, floors or furnishings of the ingredients used or the product manufactured. The Crown pointed out that if manufacture had taken place elsewhere one would not expect used and valueless items such as old milk containers to be brought back to the appellant’s premises for storage. Despite Mr Doris’s best efforts I do not find the suggestion that the remnant contents found in those vessels might have been brought back because they had some value persuasive. 
      
       
     62 In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 Dawson J, in the context of the customary direction given to the jury about circumstantial evidence, said at 579-580: 
      
       
        
         
         “But where – to use the metaphor referred to by  
         Wigmore on Evidence, 
          vol 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par 2497, pp 412-414 – the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.” 
         
        
       
     63 In my opinion, the evidence to which the trial Judge referred left it open to him to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the identified step in manufacture took place in the appellant’s premises and to reject the appellant’s contention that the hypothesis that manufacture had taken place elsewhere and the appellant’s premises were used only for storage was a reasonable hypothesis. 
      
       
     64 In my opinion, the appeal against conviction on the first count should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The second count 
        
       
     65 Mr Doris submitted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the appellant had tended or nurtured the 87 cannabis plants found on the premises. The appellant’s explanation of this derived from the record of what he had said during the search and in particular his reference to Mr Champion. Mr Hawkins expressed the opinion that the plants as found were in very good condition, standing upright with their leaves pointing in an “upright condition”. The cells were totally full of water and were in a very good condition. So was the root system which showed signs of recent root growth. Mr Hawkins had not observed the soil conditions which would have an effect on how often the plants would need to be watered but said that at least two or three times a week they would need to have some moisture. He said the plants appeared to be between four to six weeks old approximately. On the premises were found two bags of fertiliser used for hydroponic cultivation. The presence of the fertiliser and the evidence of Mr Hawkins of the healthy condition of the plants when they were found indicated they had received reasonable amounts of light, regular watering and a nutrient supply. They had been tended and nurtured.  
      
       
     66 In my opinion, bearing in mind that the appellant had said the plants belonged to Mr Champion, who, he understood, was coming back to pick them up, there was ample evidence for his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as he was, that the appellant had tended and nurtured the plants by watering and fertilising them. The appeal against the appellant’s conviction on this charge should also be dismissed. 
      
       
     67 Accordingly, I propose the following order: 
      
       
        
        Appeal dismissed.

       (ii) that in the same period they supplied another prohibited drug, namely cocaine; 
        
        
       (iii) that on 27 March 1999 they detained Jaimie Byrne with intent to hold him for advantage; 
        
        
       (iv) that on the same date they used an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely assault; 
        
        
       (v) that on the same date they assaulted Jaimie Byrne occasioning him actual bodily harm. 
        
       
     3 The jury found each of the appellants guilty on all counts, and each of them was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 Each appellant appeals against his conviction on each count and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed. 
      
       
     5 The principal witness in the Crown case was Jaimie Byrne, and I shall refer in summary to his evidence. Mr Byrne was a heroin user who purchased heroin for a period from a man named “Joe”. For a time he paid in cash, but he was then extended credit, and became indebted in an amount of $2000 approximately. Mr Byrne then met the appellant Chami who offered him the choice of working to pay off his debt or the threat of violence for non payment. Mr Byrne said he chose the former course and thereafter he sold drugs from an apartment in Chandos Street, Ashfield, which apartment, on the prosecution case, was provided for him by the appellants. Mr Byrne said he was supplied with drugs for sale by both appellants and he accounted for the takings to his suppliers. These activities were the subject of counts 1 and 2 in the indictment.  
      
       
     6 Mr Byrne said that he fell into difficulties in his accounting. He said that a drug user who he allowed to stay in the Chandos Street apartment was stealing from him. According to Mr Byrne it was as a consequence of the shortfall that the events on 27 March 1999, which gave rise to the third, fourth and fifth counts, occurred.  
      
       
     7 Mr Byrne gave evidence that the appellants drove him to a car park near an oval and he was taken from the car and kicked and punched. He was then directed to return to the car and was driven to another park where again he was taken from the car and told to walk to the oval closest to the river. There he said he was again kicked and punched and the barrel of a gun was twice placed in his mouth by the appellant Chami. Mr Byrne said that the appellant Yammine stabbed him in the toe with a knife. Mr Byrne said that as a result of the attack his teeth were chipped, his shoulder was dislocated, his body was bruised and he sustained the stabbing injury to his toe. He said that the appellant Chami told him he had until the following Sunday to pay what was owed or Chami would “put a bullet in your f… head”. Mr Byrne said he made unsuccessful attempts to raise the money and then went to the police, where he identified the appellants from an identification video. He later participated in a drive-around, showing police officers the locations where he claimed to have been attacked. 
      
       
     8 The Crown case depended upon the acceptance of the essential parts of the evidence of Mr Byrne, but it also relied upon other evidence which, it was submitted, supported the evidence of the principal witness. I shall refer to this further evidence when considering the ground of appeal that the verdicts of the jury were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
      
       
     9 Neither accused gave evidence. 
      
       
     10 Against the above outline, I now turn to consider the various grounds of appeal against conviction as advanced by each of the appellants. 
      
       
     11 There are grounds of appeal common to the appeals of each appellant and it is convenient to address these grounds first. (The numbering is mine.) 
      
       
        
       Ground 1: The directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to the unreliability of the witness Mr Byrne were inadequate 
        
       
     12 The relevant instruction was given in the following passage (SU 24-25): 
      
       
        
         
         “Members of the jury, in this case, for two reasons, I give you a warning in respect of the evidence given by Mr Byrne. On one view of the matter it may well be that he was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings. Mr Byrne himself says that he was, but he says, in effect, that he was forced into it because he feared for his life. The two accused of course deny that there were any criminal activities. Nevertheless, if you are of the view that Mr Byrne was criminally involved in these events, I warn you that his evidence may be unreliable. Persons who are criminally involved in the very matter about which they are giving evidence often lie, sometimes to protect themselves and sometimes to transfer the blame to others, often quite innocent people. 
         
        
        
         
         The second reason for giving the warning is Mr Byrne’s mental state at the time these events took place. He agrees that at times he was unable to distinguish fact from fiction, and when he said that he was talking about his condition back in 1999. I remind you too that Mr Byrne has agreed that when sentenced in the District Court he promised to give evidence against these two accused. It is necessary for you to bear in mind that that could have provided him with a motive to lie. I say ‘could have’; I am not for a moment expressing any view about it. I am not saying for a moment that he did have a motive to lie. I am saying it is a matter that you should consider; it could have provided him with a motive to lie. Whether it did or not, entirely a matter for you.” 
         
        
       
     13 The appellants each submitted that the judge was wrong to leave it to the jury to determine whether the jury was of the opinion that Mr Byrne was criminally involved in the events. Criticism was made in particular of the content of the second-last sentence of the first paragraph of his Honour’s instruction set out above. It seems to me that in expressing himself there as he did, his Honour was simply acknowledging the role of the jury as the judges of the facts. The reality was that Mr Byrne made plain in his evidence the fact of his involvement in criminal activity in the supply of heroin over a period. I do not consider the fact that the judge expressed himself conditionally in this sentence would, of itself, render the warning expressed in the passage deficient.  
      
       
     14 The Crown submitted that whilst the judge dealt with the matters attracting the warning “relatively briefly”, the instruction was sufficient to highlight the three aspects that the jury needed to consider when assessing the reliability of the evidence of Mr Byrne. It was further submitted that at the conclusion of the summing up no further directions in point were sought, although on the hearing of this appeal the Crown indicated that no point was being taken under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
      
       
     15 I have, however, come to the view for a number of reasons that the jury was given insufficient instruction in terms of the content of the warning which the circumstances of this case warranted. 
      
       
     16 Firstly, the warning concerning the mental state of the witness directed attention only to his condition in 1999 and it ignored his mental state thereafter, and in particular at the time of the trial in April 2001. 
      
       
     17 It is necessary to examine the evidence given at the trial about the mental condition of the witness with some care. 
      
       
     18 In the course of his evidence on 4 April 2001 the witness complained that he was not well and the transcript records these questions and answers (T 40): 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Q: You’re not well? 
          
         A. No, I’ve got really bad voices. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’ve got? 
          
         A. Bad voices, and I can’t understand the questions. I’m a schizophrenic.” 
         
        
       
     19 After that exchange the witness indicated that he needed his medication and that it would take half an hour. The witness resumed his evidence on the following day and these questions and answers are recorded in the transcript (T 46): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. As you no doubt recall yesterday in the course of giving evidence you had some difficulties there in the witness box and the court adjourned for the day, are you aware of that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Are you able to tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what the problem was yesterday? 
          
         A. I suffer from schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia and my voices started coming up pretty bad. 
          
          
         Q. Your voices started coming up pretty bad? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. What do you mean by that? 
          
         A. I have voices in my head that tell me to do certain things. 
          
          
         Q. Was that something that suddenly popped up while you were in the witness box or did it develop over a period of time while you were there in the box? 
          
         A. Over a period of time. 
          
          
         Q. Did that or did those symptoms affect in any way your understanding of the questions you were being asked at any stage? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Q. Did it affect in any way your hearing of what was being said in the court room at any stage? 
          
         A. Yes it did.” 
         
        
       
     20 On the following day, in the course of cross examination, the witness was asked these further questions and gave these further answers (T 181): 
      
       
        
         
          “Q. The voices that you heard allegedly on the first day that you gave evidence, should not occur whilst you’re on medication, should they? 
          
         A. They still do. 
          
          
         Q. Please answer my question sir? 
          
         A. I am still being medicated for my illness and when I am under complete stress, it comes on. It is an illness that you cannot control. If you read into it, you might know about it. 
          
          
         Q. The voices that you claim you heard on Wednesday of this week, are not supposed to occur whilst you’re taking your medication, is that not the case? 
          
         A. That’s correct.” 
         
        
       
     21 Then, on Monday 9 April 2001, the witness was being cross examined about the content of the record of interview which he gave to the police, having had the opportunity of considering it over the weekend. It emerged that he had spent the weekend in hospital: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you, in the reading of your record of interview, either or both of them, find that sort of detail told by you to the police? 
          
         A. I don’t remember, I didn’t read it very clearly, they know the reasons why, why I was in hospital. 
          
          
         Q. Mr Byrne, is it going to be the case that in respect of the other matters I’m going to ask you about, you’re going to claim you didn’t read the records of interview clearly? 
          
         A. No, because I spent most of my weekend-- 
          
          
         Q. Please-- 
          
         A. -- up in hospital. 
          
          
         OBJECTION (CROWN PROSECUTOR) 
          
          
         Q. You don’t have a clear memory of what you read over the weekend, is that what you say? 
          
         A. No I don’t. I spent most – as I said, I spent most of my time at the hospital.” 
         
        
       
     22 The mental state of the witness at the time of the alleged offences was not the only relevant consideration. His mental state at the time of giving evidence was a relevant matter to be considered by the jury when determining the reliability of his testimony. The jury was not informed that this was so, in the context of a warning under s 165(2)(b) and (c) of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     23 Secondly, whilst the jury was reminded that Mr Byrne had agreed to give evidence against the appellants and that this could have provided a motive for him to lie, the judge did not draw attention to the circumstance that, having regard to the undertaking given in the District Court, the sentence of the witness could be increased if he did not give evidence in accordance with his undertaking. In my opinion, this further instruction was called for, bearing in mind the requirements of s 165(2)(b) of the Evidence Act. See R v Stewart (2000-2001) 52 NSWLR 301. 
      
       
     24 Thirdly, once warning was requested, s 165(2) of the Evidence Act required that the judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
         
        
        
         
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
         
        
        
         
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.” 
         
        
       
     25 The warning here given did not address the substance of s 165(2)(c) so each appellant lost the benefit of a direction which warned the jury of “the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.” 
      
       
     26 Section 165(3) provides that the judge “need not comply with sub-section (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.” It has not been contended by the Crown that such reasons existed, and clearly there were none. What was missing from such warning as was given was, in my opinion, of very real significance, and I consider that this ground of appeal has been established. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: The directions to the jury by the trial judge and address by the Crown Prosecutor on Judge Viney’s assessment of the witness Mr Byrne in his sentencing proceedings were irrelevant and prejudicial to the appellant 
        
       
     27 This ground concerns what the Crown Prosecutor said in his closing address to the jury, and by way of background it is necessary firstly to refer to part of the cross examination of the witness Mr Byrne. 
      
       
     28 Counsel who appeared for the appellant Yammine at trial cross examined Mr Byrne about his sentencing procedure before Judge Viney and the relevant cross examination was as follows (T174-175): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I just remind you of what the sentencing judge said – first of all did the sentencing judge make some remarks in open court to you? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. And you were there obviously when he was making those remarks? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. I’m just looking at page 10 of the sentencing remarks of his Honour Judge Viney in this court on 28 April 2000, in the matter of Regina v Jamie Wayne Byrne, page 10 at about .7, his Honour said, ‘Next Mr Byrne has given an undertaking to give evidence against these others which in his situation, and given the nature of this sort of enterprise and where people who inform on drug deals are always at risk, then that is an heroic demonstration first of all of his contrition and indeed of his process of rehabilitation. For him to be available to give evidence against the others is extremely risky but he has taken up that position and indicated in evidence that he abides by the undertaking to give that evidence’? 
          
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     29 The reason for that cross examination appears in a later question put to Mr Byrne (T 176) and in a submission put to the jury by counsel for the appellant Yammine, which submission was taken up in the summing up. The questions asked were these: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The fact is you promised to give evidence against a person like Youssef Yammine knowing that you had nothing to fear from him because he had nothing to do with this case? 
          
         A. Whatever, he’s got plenty to do with this case, it’s-- 
          
          
         Q. Isn’t it the case Mr Byrne, that you, even to this day, you’re protecting the real thugs, you’re protecting them by not naming them? 
          
         A. No, I’ll name them right now.” 
         
        
       
     30 In the course of his closing address the Crown Prosecutor said, when addressing the jury as to the credibility of Mr Byrne: 
      
       
        
         
         “…as you have heard Jamie Byrne gave evidence before his Honour Judge Viney in April last year when he was dealt with, Jamie Byrne agreed that he was prepared to give evidence for the prosecution in this trial. 
         
        
        
         
         And you’ve heard that he, Jamie Byrne having already served five months in custody on remand bearing that in mind, his Honour Judge Viney released Jamie Byrne on a bond and in that process it was incumbent upon him to fulfil his undertaking with Judge Viney to give evidence in this trial and that’s what he has done… 
         
        
        
         
         Bear in mind this that when Jamie Byrne came before his Honour Judge Viney, you might think Judge Viney was in a very, very good position to make an assessment as professional judge of Jamie Byrne. For Judge Viney to consider Mr Byrne up close if you like and personally in totally different circumstances to what we have here in the trial where to a large extent things are pretty clinical. But in that sentencing process, I’d suggest to you and you might think as a matter of common sense, Judge Viney, A, wouldn‘t have had the wall [sic] pulled over his eyes and would have had been in a much better opportunity, a much better position to make an assessment of Jamie Byrne. So what did Judge Viney say in the process of passing sentence on Jamie Byrne? And this is in part what he said and this is the part that was read out by Mr Bailey, 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Next, Mr Byrne has given an undertaking to give evidence against these others which in his situation and given the nature of this sort of enterprise and where people who inform on drug deals are always at risk, then that is a heroic demonstration. First of all, of his contrition and indeed of his process of rehabilitation. For him to be available to give evidence against the others is extremely risky. But he has taken up that position and indicated in evidence that he abides by the undertaking to give that evidence.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         That’s what Judge Viney thought of Jamie Byrne. Even to the extent of referring to his heroic demonstration. And you might think that view formed by Judge Viney would be of some assistance to you in ultimately assessing whether you are prepared to accept what Jamie Byrne has told this Court beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     31 Whilst the cross examination incorporated part of Judge Viney’s remarks in which it was stated that Mr Byrne “indicated in evidence a willingness to abide by his undertaking”, there was in fact no evidence at the trial of the appellants that Mr Byrne had given evidence before Judge Viney. Even if he had done, there was no evidence as to whether he was subjected to cross examination, or whether what he had to say was strenuously tested.  
      
       
     32 It seems to me that the submissions of the Crown Prosecutor above recorded were most inappropriate. Unfortunately, the learned judge made reference to those submissions on a number of occasions in the course of the summing up. Those references were not disapproving but in the context of reminding the jury of the Crown’s submissions. In this connection, his Honour said (SU 19-20): 
      
       
        
         
         “In this context the Crown reminds you of what Judge Viney said when he gave the accused a bond in this court complex. He described Mr Byrne’s undertaking to give evidence as ‘a heroic demonstration of his contrition and his process of rehabilitation’. It is unlikely, the crown puts to you, that Judge Viney would have had the wool pulled over his eyes, as he would have had an excellent opportunity during the sentencing procedure of assessing Mr Byrne.” 
         
        
        
       And then (SU 33): 
        
        
         
         “The Crown Prosecutor put to you that when Jamie Byrne came before Judge Viney, the judge had an excellent opportunity of assessing him. He said, in the process of passing sentence, ‘Next, Mr Byrne has given an undertaking to give evidence’ – I have not got the whole of it noted down here, but you will recall the effect of it, members of the jury. The judge went on to say, ‘That is a heroic demonstration of his contrition and his process of rehabilitation. It is extremely risky.” 
         
        
       
     33 Then the jury was reminded on a third occasion about this topic, this time in the context of reviewing the submissions of counsel for the appellant Yammine: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Bailey then addressed you as to the judge’s comment when Mr Byrne appeared for sentence, that is that Mr Byrne’s decision to give evidence was ‘heroic’. Mr Bailey put to you that he, Mr Bailey, led that evidence to reinforce his submission that Mr Byrne knew full well that he was not giving evidence against a real drug dealer. He suggests he would certainly not have been heroic if he knew it was a real drug dealer. He knew it was not a real drug dealer. Therefore he was prepared to be heroic.” 
         
        
       
     34 No objection was taken at the trial to the regrettable emphasis placed upon the significance of what Judge Viney had to say, but to my mind the conclusion is inescapable that there was the very real risk that the jury would have been improperly influenced by what was attributed to Judge Viney in discharging its responsibility of making its independent assessment of the witness. After all, the Crown had impressed upon the jury that “Judge Viney would not have had the wool pulled over his eyes” and that he “would have had…a much better opportunity, and would have been in a much better position to make an assessment of Jaimie Byrne” (presumably than the jury). The jury was invited to consider that Judge Viney was “in a very, very good position to make an assessment as professional judge.” Those submissions should not have been put forward. 
      
       
     35 In the case of the appellant Yammine, it is true that his counsel at trial was responsible for introducing the topic which prompted the later submissions to the jury, but I do not consider that it follows that that appellant visited upon himself the real risk of miscarriage in the circumstances that occurred. Nor do I consider that the failure of counsel for either appellant who appeared at the trial to object to what occurred avoids the need for this Court to now intervene. To my mind, what occurred was so prejudicial that this Court ought not to allow the convictions to stand. The jury simply should not have been invited to have regard to any assessment of Mr Byrne that may have been attributed to Judge Viney. 
      
       
     36 Hence I conclude that this ground of appeal has been established. 
      
       
     37 Having regard to the outcome of each of the grounds I have considered, it seems to me that each of these appeals should be allowed. Because its assessment would influence a decision as to whether new trials should be ordered, it is appropriate to next consider what I shall number Ground 3. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3: That the verdict of the jury in relation to each count is unsafe and unsatisfactory 
        
       
     38 At the time written submissions were presented, this ground was being pursued by both appellants. The ground was only argued at the hearing on behalf of the appellant Chami. However, it is desirable that the Court assess the evidence as available against each appellant when now considering this ground. 
      
       
     39 The approach to be applied in considering the present ground is now well settled and was stated by Wood CJ at CL in R v Vo [2001] NSWCCA 67 at paras 29-31: 
      
       
        
         
         “29 The test to be applied in relation to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is now well settled by the decisions in  
         M v The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 487; 
          Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439; 
          Gipp v The Queen 
          (1998) 194 CLR 106; 
          Fleming  
         (1998) 197 CLR 250 and 
          Giam No 2 
          (1999) 109 A Crim R 348.  
         
        
        
         
         30 As was observed by Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey JJ in M:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.’ (See  
           Whitehorn v the Queen 
            (1983) 152 CLR 686; 
            Chamberlain v the Queen 
            [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 532; 
            Knight v the Queen 
            (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 504-505; 511).  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         31 But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. ( 
         Chamberlain v The Queen 
          [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 621).” 
         
        
       
     40 The Crown case depended upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the substance of the evidence of Mr Byrne, but having considered the entire fabric of the Crown case, it seems to me to have been open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each appellant was guilty. 
      
       
     41 There were circumstances consistent with and supporting his account of events: 
      
       
        
       (a) when he went to the police, Mr Byrne identified photos of each appellant, although there was no evidence that either was previously known to him other than in the circumstances that the witness described; 
        
        
       (b) Mr Byrne described Walid (Chami) as having a yellow Japanese sports car, and it was otherwise established that this was so; 
        
        
       (c) Mr Byrne described Youssef (Yammine) as having a silver Hyundai Excel and this was also established to be correct; 
        
        
       (d) there were the phone numbers about which Mr Byrne gave evidence which were linked to the appellant Chami. “Joe” had brought the witness into communication with Walid (Chami) and Mr Byrne had contacted “Joe” on a mobile phone number traced to “Chami Sanaa” with the same address as that of the appellant Chami. Then, according to Mr Byrne, that appellant had provided him with a mobile phone for use in the drug dealing activity in which Mr Byrne became engaged. The subscriber to that phone number proved to be the appellant Chami; 
        
        
       (e) there was evidence that linked each of the appellants to the Chandos Street apartment. When the appellant Chami was arrested, his yellow Nissan was seized and keys found in the centre console fitted the door locks of that apartment. When the appellant Yammine’s Hyundai Excel was searched, an envelope was found in the boot addressed, not to the appellant, but to an addressee at 58 Chandos Street, Ashfield. More significantly though, the fingerprints of the appellant Yammine were found on the outside of a glass sliding door at 58 Chandos Street; 
        
        
       (f) Mr Byrne gained some support for his evidence as to the attack upon him on 27 March 1999 from Mr Tannous who lived across the road from Centenary Park, Croydon. On the night upon which Mr Byrne said he was attacked, Mr Tannous said that he saw two men kicking and punching a third man who was on the ground. He was able to make out the words “money” and “we won’t trust you again”. He said that one of the men came towards him and said “You didn’t see anything, you didn’t hear anything. If you say something we’ll be back.” Mr Tannous said that he saw a yellow sports car parked near to the place where the attack occurred, and then, shortly afterwards when he was driving towards Burwood, he saw the same sports car in Shaftsbury Road, Burwood, and he said he could hear screams and yelling coming from within the car. According to his evidence, the yellow car was then travelling in the direction towards Tasker Park, and Mr Tannous later saw the appellant Chami’s motor vehicle at Ashfield Police Station. He described it as being “similar” to the vehicle that he had earlier seen; 
        
        
       (g) Mr Byrne’s description of the attack upon him at Centenary Park was not inconsistent with the description Mr Tannous gave as to what he had observed; 
        
        
       (h) then there was the evidence of Constable Faulkner. Whilst Mr Byrne said he did not previously know the names of the two parks where he was attacked by the appellants, one of the aids to their location was the location of the police random breath testing unit where Constable Faulkner was working on the night that Mr Byrne said the attacks took place. Constable Faulkner was working at a random breath testing location near Tasker Park on the night of 27 March 1999 and he said that during the course of the operation that night he saw a distinctive yellow Nissan. He had seen that same vehicle earlier that day. It was a vehicle with which he was familiar; 
        
        
       (i) Mr Byrne gave evidence that the appellant Yammine walked away from Tasker Park after Mr Byrne had been taken there and that he had returned about five minutes later with a revolver and a knife. The address of the appellant Yammine was a short distance from Tasker Park; 
        
        
       (j) Mr Byrne gave an account of injuries sustained in the attack consistent with the observations made by Detective Doran that the witness had chipped teeth, bruising to the shoulder and a lacerated big toe; 
        
        
       (k) during the drive around, police accompanying Mr Byrne located pieces of paper about which Mr Byrne gave an account to the effect that he did not know what had happened to them after the appellant Yammine had examined the records of drug sales which appeared on them; 
        
        
       (l) Mr Byrne gave evidence that at Tasker Park he was told to take some “deals” out of his mouth and that the appellant Yammine then placed them next to a tree. Detective Doran found two white balls wrapped in rubber party balloon material in a position consistent with that account. 
        
       
     42 Of course, the credibility of the witness was strenuously tested during the trial; the witness had a significant criminal history; he had a history of drug abuse, and there was the question of his mental condition upon which particular emphasis was placed in oral submissions. Nevertheless, my evaluation of all the evidence does not lead me to conclude that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each accused was guilty of each of the offences charged. 
      
       
     43 To the extent that proof of this ground depends upon the evidence available for the assessment of the jury, this attack upon the verdicts returned has not been established. 
      
       
     44 None of the remaining grounds advanced by either appellant would warrant his acquittal and it follows that, whilst I consider the convictions should be quashed, a new trial should be ordered against each appellant on each of the charges expressed in the indictment. 
      
       
     45 I propose nevertheless to address shortly the remainder of the grounds which have been argued. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4: That the directions given by the learned trial judge concerning the evidence of resemblance of the car allegedly belonging to the appellant and that seen by Mr Tannous were inadequate 
        
       
     46 This ground is relied upon by each appellant and relates to the evidence of the sighting of the yellow vehicle on 27 March 1999 to which reference has already been made. 
      
       
     47 The evidence was not identification evidence to which Pt 3.9 of the Evidence Act applied. In the course of his summing up the judge gave the following directions in respect of it (SU22-24, 11 April 2001): 
      
       
        
         
         “I come now to a rather strange thing really in the context of this case. It is a question of identification. It may seem odd to you. Members of the jury, usually when a question arises, it concerns of course the identification of a person. In this case, however, a question arises as to the identification of a motor vehicle. The evidence in question is that given by Constable Faulkner and Mr Joe Tannous. Constable Faulkner’s evidence is that the motor vehicle he saw at 3.30 pm on Saturday 27 March 1999 was the same as the vehicle he saw later that day some time between 8.50 pm and 9.40 pm. A little later I will remind you with more detail of what he said about it. Mr Tannous’ evidence is that the yellow sports car he saw from his balcony on that same Saturday, and later that day saw in Burwood, is the same vehicle he later saw at the Ashfield police station. Members of the jury, I am required to inform you that there is a special need for caution before accepting evidence of identification, whether it be identification of a person or an object. I warn you that there have been occasions when innocent people have been convicted on the basis of mistaken identification. Witnesses who appear to be certain and who are completely honest may be mistaken. Matters to which you should pay attention are the lighting present at the scene, that would apply to both circumstances here because the police constable was working at night, on one occasion at least, working his RBT unit. It was certainly at night when Mr Tannous came out onto his balcony and looked across the road towards the park. So you would need to have regard to the lighting present at the scene; the distance from which the witness’ observations were made; and, of course, the eyesight of the witness, and you have heard some evidence about that, Mr Tannous has said in evidence that he was not wearing his glasses. 
         
        
        
         
         I should point out at this stage that Constable Faulkner, when asked if it was possible that he could have made a mistake – he was asked that by Mr Stanton – he replied ‘Anything is possible.’ Mr Tannous, when shown the two photographs, exhibit A, was asked, in effect, to comment on them. He said ‘This is similar to the vehicle I saw at Centenary Park and at Shaftsbury Avenue’. I simply remind you of that at this stage. As I say, I will deal with their evidence in a little bit more detail in a moment.” 
         
        
       
     48 His Honour later went on to review at some length the evidence given by Constable Faulkner and by Mr Tannous (SU 11-19 of 12 April 2001). I do not propose here to summarise that review. 
      
       
     49 It has been submitted that the instruction to the jury was inadequate, particularly having regard to the decisions in R v Clout (1995) 41 NSWLR 312; Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555; and Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 130 ALR 35. 
      
       
     50 The evidence that the vehicle which had been sighted was similar to that yellow vehicle owned by the appellant Chami was but a circumstance in the prosecution case. It seems to me that the directions given afforded adequate assistance for the jury in their assessment of the evidence that related to this vehicle, and, indeed, no complaint was made at trial about such directions. Rule 4 has application, and I would not, in any event, have been minded to grant leave to rely upon this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 5: That the trial miscarried by reason of content of the final address of the Crown Prosecutor 
        
       
     51 Evidence was introduced on behalf of the appellant Yammine that he had no criminal record. In the course of his address, which was recorded, it appears that the Crown Prosecutor said this to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “And the prosecution doesn’t dispute that indeed Mr Yammine doesn’t have a criminal record. 
         
        
        
         
         But whether that leads to you coming to the view that he’s a person of good character is a quantum leap, I’d suggest. It would have been available to Mr Yammine to call evidence as part of his case, for people who get in that witness box and say look I’ve known Mr Yammine all his life, he’s a wonderful bloke, a good father or whatever. Not a tittle of evidence to support the claim or to support the proposition that he’s a person of good character. 
         
        
        
         
         So whilst it’s available to you to use this question of character in his favour if you are of the view that it’s appropriate to do so, the only material you have is that he does not have a criminal record. And I’d suggest to you at the end of the day the question of Mr Yammine’s character, that is good character will not have any weight with you whatsoever in your determination.” 
         
        
       
     52 In my opinion, it was not correct for the Crown Prosecutor to submit to the jury that the appellant Yammine could have called evidence of the type suggested. There was no requirement for him to do so. However, the jury was given adequate instruction in the course of the summing-up (SU 56, 12 April 2001). His Honour corrected something said earlier, but it is necessary only to refer to this last direction from which it also appears what was said earlier: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will remind you of what I did say. What I did say to you was that Mr Yammine has called evidence to establish that he is a person of good character. That evidence was the evidence of the police officer that he has no prior convictions. I then said to you you may assume that if anything unfavourable in that regard had been known of the accused, it would have been put before you by the Crown. In that regard I was referring to the fact of the convictions. It really goes beyond that because by introducing that evidence that he has no prior convictions, the plain fact of the matter is that Mr Yammine is, in a general sense, asserting to you that he is a person of good character. What I should have said is this, that you may assume that if anything unfavourable had been known of the accused, it would have been put before you by the Crown. If anything unfavourable had been known, it would have been put before you by the Crown. That is what I should have said, and I indicate to you now that that is the correct direction, and that is the direction that I now give you. I continue by saying, as this has not happened, you may proceed upon the basis that the evidence put forward by the accused is not challenged; that is the general evidence that he is a person of good character.” 
         
        
       
     53 The above direction was clear and correct and sufficed to correct the position that had been stated in the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury. 
      
       
     54 I am not persuaded that the trial miscarried because of what the Crown Prosecutor had said as to character. This challenge has not been made good so far as the appellant Yammine is concerned. 
      
       
     55 So far as the appellant Chami was concerned, no evidence was led on his behalf that he was of good character. That evidence as to character that was led by the co-accused prompted the Crown Prosecutor to make the remarks that he did. But the jury was ultimately given directions appropriate to the evidence introduced by the appellant Yammine and that same direction, or a direction to that effect, would have been invited by reason of the introduction of the evidence of good character whether the Crown Prosecutor had acted as he did or not. 
      
       
     56 A further complaint is made that in the closing address the Crown Prosecutor made comments in breach of s 20 of the Evidence Act by commenting on the failure of the accused to give evidence. This submission was prompted by the concluding remarks of the Crown Prosecutor: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, just in conclusion, you took an oath at the start of this trial to return your verdicts according to the evidence. The sworn evidence in this trial has come not just from one witness but indeed from all of the prosecution witnesses. Questions or propositions put to a witness do not make evidence. The answers make the evidence. So, accordingly, when Mr Bailey and Mr Stanton in turn suggested to Jamie Byrne that he was lying, and in fact their respective clients weren’t involved as Mr Byrne says they were involved, it is Mr Byrne’s answer that is the evidence, and the evidence in this case is that they were involved. And, additionally, as I have already pointed out, if you needed to have it pointed out to you at all, there is a wealth of material in this trial over and above what Mr Byrne has specifically said, that goes to support completely the version of events Mr Byrne has provided in evidence and accordingly I’d suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that your verdicts in all respects would be verdicts of guilty.” 
         
        
       
     57 In my opinion, what the prosecutor said in the above passage falls short of comment prohibited by s 20. In R v Siebel & Anor (1991) 59 A Crim R 105 King CJ said this (at 109): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is lawful, in my opinion, for counsel for the prosecution to make the point to the jury that the only version of the facts before them is that proved by the prosecution witnesses and, if counsel for the defence has engaged in speculation as to alternative scenarios, that there is no evidence to support such alternative scenarios. Any comment, however, that the accused person has failed to contradict prosecution witnesses or to provide an alternative version of events, or that he has not given evidence, must, in my opinion, amount to a prohibited comment.” 
         
        
       
     58 Whilst the observations of the Chief Justice were not in the context of considering the requirements of s 20, they are, nevertheless, apt in determining its application. In my opinion, there has not been any contravention of s 20 in this case.  
      
       
     59 I am not satisfied the trial of either appellant miscarried by reason of the matters raised in Ground 5. 
      
       
        
       Ground 6: The trial judge erred in not discharging the jury  
        
       
     60 It has been submitted on behalf of each appellant that the behaviour of the Crown Prosecutor in his address to the jury on the question of character should have lead his Honour to discharge the jury. I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in declining the application that he do so, and as I observed when considering Ground 5, the mischief complained of was sufficiently addressed by the directions which his Honour ultimately gave on the issue of the character evidence and its significance. This present ground has not been made out. 
      
       
     61 Apart from the grounds already considered, the appellant Yammine raised two additional grounds, as did the appellant Chami. I propose to consider these four grounds shortly. 
      
       
        
       Additional grounds relied upon by the appellant Yammine 
        
        
       7. His Honour’s summing up lacked the required degree of balance and fairness (Appellant Yammine’s ground 4) 
        
       
     62 This ground is directed to matters previously considered, including the matters considered under grounds 1 and 2 expressed as having been common to the appeals of both appellants. It is also submitted that the trial judge erred in his directions as to the good character of the appellant. That ground has been dealt with under ground 5 common to the appeals of both appellants. 
      
       
     63 However it was also submitted that his Honour’s summing up made clear reference to evidence in chief but that it did not deal in a balanced way with the material arising in cross examination. On my reading of the summing up, I do not consider that this complaint has been established 
      
       
        
       8. The directions given by his Honour as to the onus and standard of proof were erroneous and misleading (Appellant Yammine’s ground 5) 
        
       
     64 The direction that his Honour gave the jury appears at pp 9-10 of the summing up of 11 April 2001: 
      
       
        
         
         “Members of the jury, the onus of proof is the subject of the next important direction of law which I must give you. This is a criminal trial and the burden of proof of the guilt of the accused is placed firmly upon the Crown. That onus remains upon the Crown in relation to every issue in this case. There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for the accused to establish their innocence, but for the Crown to prove their guilt, and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown must satisfy you of that guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is, and always has been, a fundamentally important part of our system of justice that persons tried in these Courts are presumed to be innocent of the crime or crimes alleged them, until a jury of their fellow citizens has been satisfied by the Crown, beyond reasonable doubt, that they are guilty of those crimes. Each accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in your minds. It is vitally important that you clearly understand that the accused must be acquitted if their guilt has not been proved to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. You do not have to be satisfied that an accused person is innocent before you should acquit him.  
         If you are unable to decide where the truth lies, even though you feel that he may be guilty, if you have a reasonable doubt about it, you must find him not guilty 
         . I should warn you that suspicion is not a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion must play no part in your function as the judges of the facts. Not even the gravest suspicion will suffice as proof beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     65 There have been a number of cases in which comment has been made upon the undesirability of inviting a jury to determine where the truth lies: see R v McDonald (1984) 1 NSWLR 428 and in particular the judgment of the Chief Justice at 436 where a number of cases in point are cited. See also R v Fedler (1989) 42 A Crim R 5, and in particular the judgment of Grove J at 12 where his Honour cited what Street CJ said in McDonald.  
      
       
     66 Consistent with those authorities, it is to be regarded as preferable to avoid introducing in directions to a jury an invitation to seek to determine where the truth lies. However, taken in context, I do not consider that the language which his Honour used in the above direction was likely to distract the jury from its appropriate task. Indeed, I do not understand it to be contended by this appellant that the use of those words alone caused any miscarriage. Rather, it is submitted that the mischief arose in later directions.  
      
       
     67 In the course of reminding the jury of submissions made by counsel for the appellants at the trial, his Honour said this (SU 28, 12 April 2001): 
      
       
        
         
         “Both Mr Stanton and Mr Bailey remind you that the Crown case against each accused depends upon the evidence of Mr Byrne to the extent that unless you are satisfied that the evidence that Mr Byrne has given is truthful and reliable, unless you are satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, both accused must be found not guilty.” 
         
        
       
     68 Complaint is made that his Honour should have lent his judicial weight to those submissions. I do not accept that it was necessary for him to do so at that point of time. The summing up is to be viewed in its entirety. 
      
       
     69 A further criticism is made that when his Honour was directing the jury on joint criminal enterprise he did not spell out that the jury needed to be satisfied of that matter beyond reasonable doubt with respect to each particular charge. Again, I do not consider it was necessary for the judge to repeat the directions as to the burden and standard of proof in the immediate context of the instruction on joint criminal enterprise following so close as it did upon the instructions as to the burden and standard of proof which his Honour had given and which I have set out above. 
      
       
     70 I do not consider that there is any substance in this ground. 
      
       
        
       Additional grounds relied upon by the appellant Chami 
        
        
       9. The learned trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to lead evidence that Mr Byrne had acted under duress in relation to the counts of supply and in directing the jury that Mr Byrne was “criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings” but “he was forced into it because he feared for his life” (Appellant Chami’s ground 1) 
        
       
     71 The direction complained of in this ground was considered earlier in connection with Ground 1. 
      
       
     72 It was submitted on behalf of this appellant that it was contradictory for Mr Byrne to have pleaded guilty to charges of having supplied drugs and then to give evidence at the trial of the appellants that he felt compelled to do so by the behaviour of one or other or both the appellants. Had he acted under duress in his supply of the drugs then that would have amounted to a defence to the charges to which he pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     73 It does not seem to me that the earlier plea precluded the witness from giving the evidence which he gave at the trial of the appellants or that such evidence was necessarily inconsistent with that plea. Moreover, the jury was not invited to consider the legal concept of duress at all. It was aware that the witness had pleaded guilty in the District Court to drug offences and the evidence for its consideration led from the witness invited the conclusion that he was criminally involved. 
      
       
     74 In my opinion, this ground has not been established. 
      
       
        
       10. The learned trial judge erred in allowing the witness Mr Byrne to refresh his memory from the transcript of a record of interview from 1999 
        
       
     75 On the first day of his evidence Mr Byrne was unable to recall the telephone number of a phone which he claimed to have been given by the appellant Chami for use in the supply activities. On the second day of his evidence the witness was asked whether he was then able to recall a number and responded (T 47, 5 April 2001) “I can recall some of the digits, yes.” He was then asked to give his best recall of the digits and responded: “0419 492, and I have difficulties with the last couple of numbers. I think it was 992.” He was subsequently permitted to refresh his recollection from a transcript of interview conducted on 28 March 1999 in which was recorded the telephone number. Having so refreshed his recollection, he gave evidence as to that number that he had given to the police on 28 March 1999. 
      
       
     76 Section 32 of the Evidence Act only permits of the use of a document by a witness for the purpose of reviving his memory with leave of the court. Section 32(2) is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (2) 
          Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give leave, it is to take into account:  
         
        
        
         
         (a) whether the witness will be able to recall the fact or opinion adequately without using the document, and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) whether so much of the document as the witness proposes to use is, or is a copy of, a document that:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) was written or made by the witness when the events recorded in it were fresh in his or her memory, or  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) was, at such a time, found by the witness to be accurate.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     77 The complaint is made that counsel at the trial was not given the opportunity of being heard on the question as to whether the judge should grant leave.  
      
       
     78 Any decision to grant leave involved the exercise of the discretion and this meant that the judge had to consider the requirements of s 192 of the Evidence Act which included considering: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (2) 
          Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
         
        
        
         
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and  
         
        
        
         
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
         
        
        
         
         (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
         
        
        
         
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     79 The transcript does not disclose whether the judge considered s 192 before allowing leave but this did not necessarily reflect error: see R v Stevens [2001] NSWCCA 330 at 57. Nor is it to be assumed that the failure of the judge to specifically address s 192 before granting leave indicates that his Honour failed to consider the section. In R v Reardon & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 203 Hodgson JA expressed the opinion that it should be assumed that a judge hearing a case will continually have regard to matters of the kind referred to in s 192(2) of the Evidence Act: see Reardon at paras 30 and 31. 
      
       
     80 The evidence was that the witness had been using the phone frequently in the period of over a week immediately before the date of the interview recorded so that the number would have been fresh in his mind at the time of that interview. 
      
       
     81 What reason could have been advanced for refusing leave? When one considers the matters addressed in s 192(2), I am not persuaded that failure to mention that section before leave was granted indicates that his Honour did not consider what that sub-section required. Nor am I persuaded that a consideration of the requirements of s 192(2) ought properly to have led to the refusal to grant the leave which was allowed. 
      
       
     82 This ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
        
       FORMAL ORDERS 
        
       
     83 In my opinion each of the appeals should succeed and I therefore propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. That each appeal should be allowed; 
        
        
       2. That the convictions of each appellant and the sentences imposed on each appellant be quashed; 
        
        
       3. That new trials of each appellant be ordered.  
        
       
     84 BELL J: I agree with Studdert J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 26 June 2001, William John Walters was indicted on charges that he: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) between about January 1989 and about April 1990, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Lymkom Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Lymkom Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (2) between about February 1990 and about July 1993, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Kindby Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Kindby Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (3) between about May 1990 and about June 1993, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Frego Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Frego Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (4) between about March 1992 and about February 1994, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Taureema Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Taureema Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (5) between about February 1994, and about February 1995, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Budscan Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Budscan Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (6) between about February 1995 and about January 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Milcoy Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Milcoy Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (7) between about January 1996 and about September 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Camotray Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Camotray Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (8) between about September 1996 and about June 1997, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Convoy Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Convoy Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (9) between about July 1997 and about April 1998, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in Aloprom Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by Aloprom Pty Limited. 
          
          
         (10) between about April 1998 and about May 1998, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was knowingly concerned in AJ Australia Pty Limited defrauding the Commonwealth in respect of group tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner of Taxation by AJ Australia Pty Limited. 
         
        
       
     2 He pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was tried before Sully J and a jury. After a hearing lasting fourteen days, on 13 July 2001, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts.  
      
       
     3 On 27 July 2001, the trial judge sentenced the appellant as follows: on count 1, two years’ imprisonment (27 July 2001 to 26 July 2003); on each of counts 2, 3 and 4, three years’ imprisonment concurrent with that for count 1 (27 July 2001 to 26 July 2004); on each of counts 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, four years and eight months’ imprisonment (27 July 2004 to 26 March 2009), with a non-parole period of three years (27 July 2004 to 26 July 2007); and on count 10, three years’ imprisonment (27 July 2004 to 26 July 2007). On 23 August 2001, the trial judge formally set a non-parole period of six years in connection with all sentences. 
      
       
     4 The appellant appeals from the conviction on all counts, and seeks leave to appeal from the sentences.  
      
       
        
       CROWN CASE 
       
     5 The Crown case was that the appellant had been the principal of each of the ten different companies named in the charges, and that during the period January 1989 to May 1998 had conducted a substantial bricklaying business in the names of those companies, successively, contracting mainly for Meriton Apartments.  
      
       
     6 The Crown alleged that each company had employed a large number of men, the number ranging at different times from about 60 to about 250, and had regularly deducted group tax from their pay; but that there had been substantial defaults in remitting the group tax to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 
      
       
     7 The amounts of the defaults alleged, and the periods of operation of the companies in respect of which the defaults arose, were as set out in the following table: 
      
       
        
        1 Lymkom Pty Ltd 1/89-4/90 (1 yr 4 mths) $500,230.42 
        
        
        2 Kindby Pty Ltd 2/90-7/93 (3 yrs 6 mths) $484,142.60 
        
        
        3 Frego Pty Ltd 5/90-6/93 (3 yrs 2 mths) $191,939.92 
        
        
        4 Taureema Pty Ltd 3/92-2/94 (2 yrs) $892,996.84 
        
        
        5 Budscan Pty Ltd 2/94-2/95 (1 yr 1 mth) $639,508.98 
        
        
        6 Milcoy Pty Ltd 2/95-1/96 (1 yr) $1,087,939.27 
        
        
        7 Camotray Pty Ltd 1/96-9/96 (9 mths) $559,397.65 
        
        
        8 Convoy Pty Ltd 9/96-6/97 (10 mths) $1,082,955.25 
        
        
        9 Aloprom Pty Ltd 7/97- 4/9 8 (10 mths) $1,701,760.28 
        
        
        10 AJ Australia Pty Ltd 4/98-5/98 (6 wks) $161,350.37 
        
       
      
      
       
        
       This shows a total of about $7.3 million dollars of unremitted group tax payments over a period of nine years four months.  
        
       
     8 The Crown alleged that each company, during its operating life, received substantial income from bricklaying activities; but that the appellant had applied that income in large part to very extravagant personal expenditure and had thereby effectively stripped the companies of their available funds. When a point was reached in the life of each company when it was clear that the company had no chance of paying its accumulated arrears of group tax, the company was wound down and its employees and work in progress was transferred to a new company. This left the Commissioner of Taxation unable to recover group tax.  
      
       
     9 On the basis of that material, the contention of the Crown was that the appellant, as the person having sole effective control of the financial affairs of each company, intended, between the dates charged in the relevant count, that those affairs should be so conducted that the Commissioner of Taxation would be left without effective recourse to company assets to obtain payment of group tax, and that this involved dishonest conduct by the company and by the appellant.  
      
       
        
       EVIDENCE AND DEFENCE CASE 
       
     10 At the trial, the Crown called evidence from accountants involved in establishing the successive companies.  
      
       
     11 James Ball gave evidence that he worked for the appellant during the operations of Lymkom; that he repeatedly advised the appellant of Lymkom’s group tax obligations; that he warned the appellant that his personal expenditures were too high to permit the company to meet its obligations; and that he eventually advised the appellant to put Lymkom into the hands of a liquidator. He advised the appellant to set up Kindby to carry on the bricklaying business, and Frego as an administration company. He received notices from the ATO regarding very substantial arrears of group tax of Kindby, and repeatedly advised the appellant of his obligations. In about late 1993, he refused to set up a further company for the appellant and ceased working for him. 
      
       
     12 Stephen Bates gave evidence that he worked for the appellant from early 1994 to mid-1997; that he reminded the appellant of his obligation to remit group tax on those occasions when he became aware of default; and that he informed the appellant that he was no longer willing to work for him in mid-1997.  
      
       
     13 Three other accountants gave evidence concerning the formation of companies between mid-1997 and early 1998.  
      
       
     14 The Crown also called evidence from persons dealing with the bricklaying business. 
      
       
     15 Laureen Place gave evidence that she was bookkeeper for all the companies throughout the period the subject of the charges; and that throughout the appellant had control of the companies, hired and fired employees, dealt with Meriton Apartments, and maintained exclusive control over the bank accounts, holding cheque books and writing all cheques. She was instructed by the appellant to transfer employees from one company to the next through the sequence of ten companies. She kept the appellant informed of group tax remittance arrears. 
      
       
     16 Diane Reynolds gave evidence that she was accounts manager for Meriton Apartments from April 1994 to the end of the period of the charges. The appellant dealt exclusively with Meriton Apartments concerning the bricklaying business of the succession of companies, and he made all claims for payments and received all cheques.  
      
       
     17 Robert Moody, from the office of the liquidator of Conroy, gave evidence that he interviewed Melita Kristoff, a director of Conroy, in the presence of the appellant, and her account was to the effect that she knew nothing of the affairs of that company and that the appellant carried on that company’s business.  
      
       
     18 Evidence was given by two other employees of the business inter alia concerning the continuity of the business through the succeeding companies. Evidence was called from John Ebergir and Brenda Walters, who were shown as employees in the wages records of relevant companies, to the effect that they did no work in the business. Three other witnesses gave evidence as to payments for personal expenses from the companies. Extensive documentation of the financial dealings of the companies was put into evidence.  
      
       
     19 Accountants James Walton and Brian Booth were called. Mr. Walton gave evidence of analyses showing the source and application of funds, called “coversheets”, one for each company plus a combined coversheet for Kindby, Frego and Taureema. These documents set out figures for the income of the respective companies and how this income was applied, including amounts paid to the ATO and unpaid group tax, and personal expenses of the appellant. The figures for the first nine companies showed the latter to be between 69% and 100% in respect of the various companies, and to be 46% in relation to the tenth company. Mr. Walton was cross-examined in detail to suggest that some amounts included in the coversheets as personal expenses or unallocated were in fact business expenses; although it should be noted that the unallocated amounts were not in any event included in the personal expenses and the percentages mentioned above.  
      
       
     20 Mr. Booth supported the appropriateness and accuracy of Mr. Walton’s analyses. 
      
       
     21 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. There was called on his behalf an accountant Roslyn Lapsley, who produced reconstructed profit and loss accounts of the companies commencing with Budscan, the company referred to in count 5. These reconstructed accounts indicated what business expenses would have been, based on industry percentages; and were used to support a contention that there was not the money available either to pay personal expenses or group tax as suggested by the coversheets.  
      
       
     22 The defence was essentially that the Crown did not prove defrauding by the companies or knowing involvement by the appellant. Having regard to Ms. Lapsley’s evidence, the Crown had not proved there was money available which was diverted to the appellant’s personal use. It was not shown beyond reasonable doubt that the failure to pay group tax was otherwise than due to shortage of money and selection between competing commitments, and also disorganisation. No acts or omissions of the appellant that amounted to knowing involvement had been proved. 
      
       
     23 As regards the summing up, it will be convenient to refer to relevant parts of that in relation to particular grounds of appeal. I have already stated the outcome of the trial.  
      
       
     24 It will be convenient to group the submissions under a number of headings, each embracing a number of grounds of appeal. There is some overlapping between grounds of appeal and also between the headings I will adopt. 
      
       
        
       ELEMENTS OF OFFENCES 
       
     25 A number of grounds of appeal relate in various ways to alleged deficiencies in the summing up concerning the elements of the offences with which the appellant was charged. Some of these grounds also relate to submissions concerning alleged unfairness in the summing up, to which I will come later. The relevant grounds are grounds 4, 8, 10, and 11I which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         4. His Honour erred in that he did not at any stage in the summing up address the question of the conduct, acts or omissions by the accused that is said to constitute the evidence that the accused was knowingly concerned with each of the companies subject to indictment in which the accused was not a director. 
          
          
         8. The “structure document” suggesting 6 points of “well intentioned piece of advice” which His Honour handed to the jury suggesting the approach that the jury may take to evaluating the evidence was nothing less than an expression of His Honour’s views and was in the circumstance unfair to the accused and lacking in judicial balance so as to amount to a miscarriage of justice. 
          
          
         10. His Honour erred in that at no point during the summing up did he state to the jury that they should disregard the prejudicial effect of the evidence led by the Crown as to the use of extravagant life style lived by the accused up to the point of his arrest such evidence including evidence of the purchase or lease of luxury motor vehicles and boats, overseas holidays, the use of limousines and of the employment of a chauffeur whereas he aught (sic) to have stated to the jury that they should specifically focus on the evidence in support of the elements said to constitute section 29D of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 as amended. 
          
          
         11I. His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that the jury must not make any adverse inferences against the Appellant merely because the jury was satisfied that the companies named in the indictment; leased or hire purchased luxury motor vehicles and boats for the personal use of the Appellant; made personal payments to the Appellant out of the business account of the company; transferred its contracts and employees to another company; employed and used family members and associates of the Appellant as directors and signatories on cheque accounts; and should have directed the jury that the jury was only entitled to make an adverse inference based upon such conduct when after considering all of the evidence in respect of each of the companies named in the indictment the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was accompanying the conduct concerned in respect of a particular company named in the indictment an intention to thereby defraud the Commonwealth of Group Tax required to be remitted to the Commissioner and also that the Appellant was knowingly concerned in such conduct accompanied by the said intention to defraud. 
         
        
       
     26 The principal directions given by the trial judge concerning the elements of the offence were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Now, ladies and gentlemen, the next section of the summing-up to which we come looks at the essential elements of each of the ten offences charged. That is to say, looks at each of those things which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt if it is to succeed in its case on any particular count in the indictment. 
          
          
         I am going to distribute to you a copy of a document; and I will ask you then, when you have it, to be patient and to go through it with me, not because I think you can't read it for yourselves, but because if we just go through it together that will, I think, usefully focus what I want to get across to you in connection with this aspect of these matters. 
          
          
         In respect of each separate charge of the ten which have been brought in the indictment, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt as to that particular company named in the particular charge, each of the six numbered matters which follow. The first of them is: 
          
          
         1. That in fact the particular company failed to pay the Commissioner of Taxation, as required by law, monthly amounts of group tax deducted from the gross wages of the various persons who were employed by that company during its operational lifetime. 
          
          
         You will remember that the unchallenged evidence is that the law, relevantly, was that group tax had to be paid for a given month by the seventh of the succeeding month. That wasn't an optional extra. That is what the law required to be done, not to be paid in part, or to be paid as best one could; or to be the subject of a well intentioned attempt to pay. The law required that money that had been taken from the gross wage packet of the employees should be remitted by the seventh of each month to the Commissioner of Taxation. 
          
          
         2. That the failure of the company so to pay the lawfully required group tax continued in such circumstances as to entail that the Commissioner was left, not only unpaid, but without recourse to any company assets from the proceeds of which he could recover what he was owed by the company. 
          
          
         3. That such failure on the part of the company was dishonest. Dishonest in this context means dishonest according to the standards of honesty accepted in contemporary society by ordinary decent people. 
          
          
         May I pause there, again emphasising why you are here and the importance of what it is that you are asked to put into the trial. You are asked to say what all of our fellow citizens in contemporary society would accept as being ordinary decent standards of probity and honesty in connection with affairs of this kind. It is not a matter of legal art. It is a matter for the judgment of a jury chosen at random representing the community. 
          
          
         The Crown case in that connection is that the company dissipated on other things monies that should have been remitted to the Commissioner in payment of group tax, and such conduct was dishonest in the relevant sense because it was done in the knowledge and with the intention that the result of the dissipation of its funds would be that the Commissioner would not be paid sums lawfully payable to him on account of group tax. 
          
          
         4. That the accused had the effective control of the operations, and in particular of the financial affairs of that particular company. 
          
          
         5. That the accused knew, therefore, of the dishonest conduct of the company. 
          
          
         6. That the accused, having that knowledge, acted in such a way as assisted the accomplishment of dishonesty of the company. 
          
          
         Let us pause there because the vehicle count by count with which you are concerned is a company; and because the true culpability for what was done, as the Crown puts the case in each case, feeds back not to some disembodied legal corporate entity, but to an individual, namely the accused, the charges had to be framed in each case, and the essential ingredients have to be defined in each case, in a way which recognises the existence and the separate corporate identity of the company as the vehicle within which the jobs were being taken, and work was being done, and money was being received, and the money was being paid out, and the related particular position vis-a-vis the company of the individual of whom it is said that in every real sense he was the company, because of his relationship to the corporate entity and to the nature and extent of his control over the way in which the affairs of the company were conducted. 
          
          
         That explains why it is necessary to frame the essential elements in a way which deals discretely with the corporate structure and the individual conduct in connection with the affairs of the corporate structure, but as the written directions go on to point out, when all of that is said and done, at the heart of the Crown case in each particular case is, may I say, a simple question in terms of definition at any rate, and that question is set out on page 2,  
          
           
           ""Did the accused, as the person having the sole effective control of the financial affairs of the particular company, intend, between the dates charged in the relevant counts of the indictment, that those affairs should be so conducted that the Commissioner of Taxation would be left without any effective recourse to company assets in order to secure the payment of amounts of unpaid group tax to which he, the Commissioner, was lawfully entitled."" 
           
          
          
         It has been put to you more than once, and in more than one form and context, that intention is at the very heart of each of these cases. So indeed it is; and the way in which it is correctly conceptualised in terms of the particular cases is as set out in that written set of directions. Those directions having been set in place, and you having taken hold in a properly clear fashion of those essential elements, you have then to come to the principal part of your job, which is to apply those principles of law to the evidence in connection with each of the successive counts in the indictment; and in connection separately with each of the companies. We will do that in a moment together beginning with Lymkom. But before doing that it is necessary to give consideration to this matter. 
          
          
         Before you can approach in a coherent logical kind of way the particular affairs of any of these particular companies, it will be necessary for you to set for yourselves what shall I call a structure, or a framework, by reference to which you can deal with the particular items of relevant evidence. 
          
          
         Something, in other words, which is a fixed point of reference that will give sense to the particular things that you are looking at in the evidence respecting the particular company with which you have been dealing. I am not able to give you, on a strict view, directions of law as to how you do that in the jury room; you are the judges of the facts, and you are entitled, provided that you apply the law as I give it to you, to approach your fact finding exercise in whatever way you think is logical and helpful. But I would not be content that I had given you the assistance to which you are entitled if I did not at least suggest a structural framework which it seems to me, although ultimately it is a matter for you, might help give that focus, company by company, to what you will be doing. May I therefore suggest that you might do this. 
          
          
         When you settle down with Lymkom, the first in order of the companies, the first thing you would do is take out your copy of exhibit A, the indictment, and put it down in front of you on the table, and keep it there as a document which will constantly focus your attention upon the need to deal separately and successively with each of these ten companies. Can I suggest that you should then take out of the same folder, the bar chart, a copy of which I am holding up for you; and you should put that down with the indictment, for the reason that the bar chart will give you at once a bird's eye view of the companies by name; of the sequence in which they operated; of the relationship; where there is demonstrably one, between the closing down effectively of the operations on one hand, and the starting up effectively of the operations of the successor company; and a general understanding of how the companies operate successively throughout the total time span of nearly ten years or whatever it is, with which the case is, overall, concerned. 
          
          
         Those things being in place you should, may I suggest, cross refer the relevant company registration details which you will get out of the exhibit A. You remember there is one sheet for each company behind its tab. It tells you when the company was incorporated, when it was deregistered, who were the relevant directors and secretaries and so forth. I will be suggesting to you, I may as well say now, for your consideration, but it is a matter for you, that in the end that material will not take you very far in considering these particular cases; but it is there, and it is part of the evidence, and in the spirit of approaching in a logical kind of way the structuring of a consideration of the individual counts, you should I suggest be mindful of what that-information is. 
          
          
         Thirdly you should take note of the relevant default history; noting whether or not the defaults were persistent defaults throughout the period charged in the relevant count of the indictment. You will find in exhibit L the information that you need in that regard. 
          
          
         Fourthly you should come in each case to the coversheet. I say that because however one twists and turns in arguing the pros and cons of these matters, in the end the analysis which is crystallised in the coversheet for the particular company is the structure of the Crown case; that is the real core of the factual material upon which the Crown relies. It is not the only thing on which the Crown relies, of course. But it is essentially at the very heart of what the Crown is arguing. 
          
          
         In connection with the overview in the relevant coversheet you will need to attend to a number of related questions first. First, is it necessary to consider in that particular company's case Miss Lapsely's evidence? The answer is no as to the companies before Budscan, yes as to the company Budscan and the successive companies, they being the companies as to which she purports to give the expert opinion evidence that you heard her give, and to which we will come in proper detail in a short while. What specific challenges, you will want to ask, were made to Mr Walton's coversheet picture in respect of that company. Was, any such challenge made good? If so, is the result significant in the overall result? I will have more to say to you about that when I come more closely to look with you at Lymkom. 
          
          
         The fifth point that you should look at, I would suggest, is this. What is the relationship between the total amount taken by the accused out of the particular company, whether it is wages or is any other form of non-business benefit. And then, the amount of group tax unpaid; you will find those details in the top half of the document which is exhibit R. You will need to consider, armed with that information, whether it is a fair inference or not that the amount taken by the accused, either as wages or as non-business benefits, would have been sufficient, had it been left in the company, either to pay the whole of the arrears of group tax; or if not the whole, at least a significant proportion. 
          
          
         Again, if I do not detain you with the figures it is because they are simple arithmetical calculations and they are all made out for you in exhibit R. 
          
          
         Sixth and finally, what evidence is there of relevant warnings or other notifications given to the accused as to his obligations respecting the payment as required by law of group tax lawfully payable by that particular company? 
          
          
         May I just run through those very quickly again. 
          
          
         There are six points that I have suggested. One, the dates charged and the relevant count of the indictment. Two, the relevant registration details taken from exhibit A. Three, the relevant default history. Four, the overview given in the relevant coversheet prepared by Mr Walton with the associated questions that I suggest in that connection. Five, the relationship between the total amount taken by the accused out of the company, whether it is wages or non-business benefit, and the amount of group tax unpaid. And the related question that I put to you about fair inferences available to be drawn from that conjunction of material. And six, what evidence is there of relevant warnings or other notifications given to the accused of his obligations to pay his group tax in a way that the law required? 
          
          
         Please understand: I am not suggesting that that structure that I have suggested should in any way cause you simply to pass over, or to disregard in any other way, the careful submissions that were put to you by the Crown and by counsel for the accused. They have their proper place, and we will come presently to come have a look at them. All I am suggesting is that if you are to make sense in the individual case by individual case of the swirl of documents and competing arguments that have been put to you, it would seem to me to be essential that you start off by putting in place a structure which will give, if you adhere to it, a logical form, and a logical sequence, to the way in which you mark and analyse the particular evidence relevant to the particular case. I am bound to tell you yet again that it is a well intentioned piece of advice as a matter of fact. It is not a direction of law. I hope that you will find it of some assistance in fact when you are looking at these matters. 
         
        
        
       The jury were given a document to take with them into the jury room setting out the paragraphs distinctly numbered 1-6 in the above extract and also the question stated as being at the heart of the Crown case.  
        
       
     27 In relation to ground 10, the relevant passage of the summing up is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The fourth direction of law has to do with something touched on by counsel; something which, if I may say so, you would understand for yourself. You must set aside carefully as jurors anything that smacks of bias or prejudice or mere sympathy of any kind. It doesn't matter whether it is bias and prejudice in favour of the Crown and adverse to the accused; or bias and prejudice in favour of the accused. 
          
          
         There are a lot of things in this case which are apt to excite, I suspect, strong reactions from people. Questions of payments of taxes, questions of lifestyle, questions of that kind; as a matter of common sense experience in the real world, questions about which a lot of people have very precise, and very strong, views one way or another. It is important to understand that attitudes of that kind, inferences of that kind, predispositions of that kind, have all got to be set firmly and completely and scrupulously apart. The accused is to be tried upon a proper view of the evidence and nothing else. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     28 Mr. Abdul-Karim for the appellant first referred to Spies v. The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 603, and submitted that the appellant could not be held to have defrauded the Commonwealth, with whom the appellant had no legal relationship, because the appellant’s actions made it less likely that the various companies would pay money owing to the Commonwealth. In this case, the most that could be said was that regular expenditure of the companies’ moneys in various ways left insufficient money to pay the group tax. All this was done openly and without concealment, with full disclosure to the Commissioner of Taxation of group tax liability, and with payment of some of that liability. The evidence that was led of the appellant’s extravagant lifestyle did not support an inference of dishonesty by the company or by the appellant, but was prejudicial. In any event, the amount of money shown to be involved in this lifestyle (payment of car and boat leases, overseas holidays, etc.) were small compared with the group tax liability, and direction of these amounts towards that liability would not have satisfied it. 
      
       
     29 Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that, especially having regard to the lack of reliability of the documentary material, it could not be said that non-payment of the group tax was due to any dishonesty of the appellant rather than (say) poor profitability of the companies and disorganisation. The lack of dishonest intention was supported by evidence that the appellant had sought to borrow $1 million in order to pay group tax. In respect of counts 6-10, the appellant was not even a director of the company, and in respect of counts 9 and 10, one director Mr. Jack signed the cheques. Mr. Jack was not called by the Crown, and there was evidence that he exercised control over the companies.  
      
       
     30 Dealing specifically with ground 4, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the trial judge did not identify any specific acts or omissions of the appellant that could indicate that he was knowingly concerned. The trial judge implied that it was sufficient if the appellant was aware of the companies’ group tax obligations and of their not being able to meet them. This was a misdirection: R. v. Tannous (1987) 10 NSWLR 303 at 308-9, R. v. Buckett (1995) 79 ACrimR 302 at 306.  
      
       
     31 In relation to ground 8, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that in presenting the elements of the offence, and giving advice, the trial judge in effect repeated the Crown case and gave it his imprimatur: cf. B v. The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 599 at 605-6. He did not advert to the defence case at all.  
      
       
     32 As regards grounds 10 and 11I, there were admitted into evidence coloured bar charts showing many luxury motor vehicles and boats, which was material very prejudicial to the appellant. Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the material was not probative, because it was not shown that if these items had not been paid for the companies could have satisfied the group tax liability. There was no appropriate direction given as to the use of these charts, or appropriate to avoid prejudice.  
      
       
     33 Mr. Fagan SC for the Crown submitted that, in relation to the six paragraphs concerning the elements of the offence, the only matter as to which a contrary submission was put by Dr. Bishop for the appellant at the trial was that it was necessary to show intent continuing throughout each of the relevant periods. That matter is not a ground of appeal. Mr. Fagan submitted that it was reasonable for the trial judge to explain the elements of the offence in terms of what the Crown had to prove, and to deal with the defence case later, as he did.  
      
       
     34 As regards grounds 4, Mr. Fagan submitted that the Crown case was that the appellant was the mind and will of each company, even when not formally appointed a director; and that accordingly his dishonesty was both the dishonesty of the company and his own knowing concern. This was supported by the evidence of Ms. Place, Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Brierley. As regards Mr. Jack, the material went no further than that he signed some cheques, and accompanied the appellant at various times.  
      
       
     35 The Crown case was that dishonesty could be inferred from the lavish expenditure, despite warnings, and later from the knowledge gained from the fate of earlier companies, and from the moving of employees and the benefit of the contractual connection with Meriton to new companies successively.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     36 In my opinion, the six numbered paragraphs referred to by the trial judge in the summing up and stated in the document given to the jury were appropriate to put the elements of the offences to the jury. Furthermore, in my opinion there was in this case nothing untoward in explaining how the Crown sought to make these elements out: in my opinion, what the trial judge did was no more than state that this was what the Crown was undertaking to prove, leaving the defence case to be given later. Furthermore, the absence of any relevant objection by the appellant’s Counsel means that r.4 applies, and I would not in any event grant leave, at least unless the later grounds concerning failures of the appellant’s Counsel should be made out. I would note that these numbered paragraphs were different from the “well-intentioned piece of advice” referred to in ground 8, although that advice also contained six points: I see no error in that advice.  
      
       
     37 In my opinion also, it was open to the jury to find that the appellant was the mind and will of each company at all times; that he determined that available money in the company should be spent on his own personal matters, money which could have been used to pay group tax; and that the appellant knew that thereby each company would be rendered unable to pay the Commissioner of Taxation so that the Commissioner of Taxation would ultimately not be paid at all. It was also open to the jury to find that this amounted to dishonesty both of each company and of the appellant. It did not matter, in my opinion, that the relevant amounts of expenditure would not have fully paid the group tax, so long as they could have paid a substantial part of that group tax and the expenditure deprived, and was known to deprive, the Commissioner of that substantial part.  
      
       
     38 In my opinion, there is no substance in the argument that the expenditure merely amounted to choices between competing creditors, not all of whom could be paid. It was open to the jury to find that the appellant chose to create obligations for his own personal purposes; and in any event, even the pre-existing leases of motor vehicles, as to which it was submitted that the appellant had not during the period of any charge created an obligation to pay, were all in the name of the appellant and not guaranteed by the relevant companies, so that there never was an obligation on the companies to pay them.  
      
       
     39 The circumstance that there was no attempt to conceal the liabilities, and apparently no attempt to conceal assets available, and also the evidence of the attempt to borrow $1 million, could have been considered factors in favour of the appellant; but the inference of dishonesty was well and truly open.  
      
       
     40 In my opinion, all these matters were fairly before the jury, and fairly put to them in the summing up. The summing up also appropriately warned the jury against bias or prejudice arising from issues of lifestyle.  
      
       
     41 Accordingly, in my opinion there is no substance in the grounds and submissions concerning the elements of the offences.  
      
       
        
       JOINING OF COUNTS 
       
     42 There are a number of grounds concerning the joining of the various counts, and in particular raising the point that this joinder, and also the way the evidence was presented, involved the danger that the evidence would be used by the jury as tendency and/or coincidence evidence despite non-satisfaction of the requirements of ss.97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act. It is necessary to have regard to those sections, and also s.95 of the Act, which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         95(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.  
          
         (2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
          
         (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or  
          
         (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         (2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
          
         (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
          
         (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.  
          
          
         98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:  
          
         (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or  
          
         (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if:  
          
         (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and  
          
         (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.  
          
         (3) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
          
         (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
          
         (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.  
          
         (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  
          
         (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.  
          
         (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.  
         
        
       
     43 The grounds dealing with this matter are grounds 1,2 and 9, which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. His Honour erred in not warning the jury when looking at and evaluating the bar chart evidence, about the danger of drawing adverse inferences of tendency and coincidence that are apparent on the face of the bar chart evidence which inferences must not be drawn by the jury and instead to confine themselves to a proper evaluation of the evidence relating to each individual count of the indictment and in failing to do so his Honour contravened sections 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
          
          
         2. Despite Defence Counsel’s objection to the tender, His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion by allowing the prosecution to tender into evidence coversheets purporting to analyse and list into various categories money received and expended by the companies subject to the ten indictments despite the apparent danger that such documents would cause the jury to draw inferences of tendency and coincidence adverse to the accused. 
          
          
         9. His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion to allow into evidence the bar charts and the company coversheets without taking into consideration the requirements of sections 135 and 136 of the Evidence Act 1995, given the danger that the jury was likely to be mislead (sic) and confused by such evidence. 
         
        
       
     44 The passages from the trial relevant to these grounds are firstly a passage during the hearing concerning the necessity to consider each charge separately, and secondly another passage to the same effect in the summing up: 
      
       
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, so you understand that it is important that you do, there are among the documents, as I think we have already noticed on an earlier occasion, at least one coversheet which brings together in a merged kind of way, figures relating to three of these companies. 
          
          
         You will be told time after time and not least of all by me in the summing-up that you must at all times remember there are ten distinct matters each of which have to be looked at by you distinctively in a way that will be finally canvassed by counsel in their addresses, and me in the summing up. So we will sort out that problem. So Mr Bishop's apprehension, which I think is the foundation of the objection is met, that is to say the risk that such a composite document will lead you into the error of mixing up rather than of keeping separate the individual counts in the indictment. Keep tucked away in the back of your minds the need for there to be exact and distinct each of these companies. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         First of all it is important to understand that there are within this trial as it were ten trials. You are trying ten separate matters. It is true, of course, that there is some, I would have thought, overlap in areas of the evidence. There is certainly an overlap in what I would be suggesting to you in terms of a practically structured approach to each of the counts in the indictment. All of that said however, it remains a cardinal feature of this trial that each count must be considered separately and must be the subject in the way that I have explained of a separate unanimous verdict. It does not at all follow that having reached a verdict, for example, on the first count, that you automatically extrapolate that verdict through the rest of the indictment. That would be quite the wrong way of doing it. It would be equally wrong, for example, having come to the same verdict on the first six counts, to say something along the fines of: ""Well really, six out of ten; there is no reason not to say the same thing about the other four"". It really is very important to try to understand that those global approaches are not permissible. There are ten separate matters. You must look at each separately. 
         
        
       
     45 The other relevant passages are passages in the summing up explaining the Crown’s case on intention: 
      
       
        
         
         What, then, is to be said about intention? The Crown's case essentially is that it is a matter of common sense that if you look at those movements of funds in the company, then after all the peripheral debating points have been made the end result is this: the accused was living at a level that required him to have access to large sums of money. If and when he got to the position where he had to choose between using the available funds for his personal non-business expenditure, and cutting down his non-business expenditure and paying his group tax, then in the case of Lymkom his response was completely simple. He kept up his own level of personal non-business expenditure. He did not pay his group tax as by law required; and when it became clear it was not going to be possible to do two of those things at once forever, he transferred out of Lymkom to Kindby, the next company in sequence, his employees, whatever assets Lymkom had that were in a real sense valuable assets in the conduct of his bricklaying business, and every other real function. In a sense, simply shifted the relevant assets and business of the one company into the fresh company with the result, so the Crown contends, that Lymkom was left in such a state that it doesn't matter really how it came to be legally terminated. In every effective business sense it was left asset stripped of anything to which the Commissioner might have recourse to recover the unpaid amounts of group tax. 
          
          
         That is, as I understand it, the essence of the way in which the Crown puts its case, and the Crown argues that if that is right, what can be said about intention except that he intended to bring about that result? He knew how much he was taking out. He knew that there were accumulated amounts of group tax. He knew that they were not being paid, in breach of his obligation to pay properly, the way the law required. He must be taken to have had a normal understanding of the fact that he could not go on forever; and that as I said a moment ago, put in that position he made his choice in the way that I have summarised for you. The Crown case, as I have said, is that if you accept that, it will follow as a matter of course, that he had the requisite intention in connection at least with Lymkom. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         When you come to look in connection with Kindby at the question of what warnings the accused had about his group tax position, you will bear in mind of course that the warnings that he had and the experiences that he had earlier with Lymkom didn't suddenly vanish. If one is looking to see what was his real position in terms of knowledge and understanding of the kind of situation in which he was finding himself by the time he got to Kindby, not only are those warnings given by Mr Ball in point, but there is as well what I would call his accumulated experience, up to that time. So that, you might think, - but it is a matter for you, - that as one progresses through this succession of companies it becomes logically more difficult to say - “I simply didn't know. I simply didn't understand what the situation was"". 
          
          
         That is not a direction of law. It is a comment on the facts and a matter for you. But that certainly is something, however you resolve it, that you will need to consider for yourselves so far as concerns crystallising the Crown and defence cases in the Kindby matter. 
         
        
       Submissions 
       
     46 Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the danger that the jury would in substance use the evidence on the various counts as showing a tendency to act in certain ways or to have a certain state of mind, and/or to infer that the number of similar occurrences suggested that the defaults must be intentional, was so great that separate trials should have been sought and ordered, and/or that the Crown should have tested the admissibility of this material as tendency and/or coincidence evidence. This danger was made worse by the way evidence was presented, in particular with the bar charts relating to the leases of expensive vehicles overlapping the periods of different companies, and also the coversheets being presented in identical form for the various companies, with no discrimination the different circumstances of different companies concerning incorporation, functioning, directors, etc. In terms of grounds 2 and 9, all this exacerbated the danger. As regards ground 1, there was no, or no sufficient, warning against that use of the evidence.  
      
       
     47 Mr. Fagan submitted that it was never suggested to the jury that there was any reliance on the material by way of tendency or coincidence. The trial judge correctly insisted on separate consideration of each count. The only way in which it was suggested that evidence as to one count might support evidence on the others was that it was put that the knowledge gained by the appellant from the events concerning the earlier companies made it very difficult for him to suggest inadvertence in relation to the later companies. Furthermore, no relevant objection was taken to the summing up in relation to these matters, nor was there any relevant request for re-direction. 
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     48 In my opinion, the evidence in relation to the early counts was highly relevant and highly probative of intention in relation to the later counts. By the time the appellant was associated with (say) Budscan, he had already seen Lymkom go into liquidation owing about $500,000.00 to the Commissioner, Kindby go into liquidation owing just under $500,000.00, Frego go into liquidation owing a little under $200,000.00, and Taureema go into liquidation owing a little under $900,000.00. That was highly probative of the appellant’s knowledge, understanding of consequences, and intention, in relation to Budscan and later companies, not by way of tendency or coincidence evidence, but purely by way of evidence of knowledge. The high probative value of that evidence in that respect, in my opinion, makes it unlikely in the extreme that any application for separate trials in relation to the different counts would have been successful. A trial in which the Crown was deprived of the opportunity to rely on the material in that way, in relation (say) to the charges concerning Budscan onwards, would have been unfair to the Crown.  
      
       
     49 It is true that there was a danger that the material could have been used as tendency evidence or coincidence evidence. That is, it is possible that a jury could reason that, because such similar events happened in relation to so many companies, the appellant had a tendency to act in this way or to have an intention to do so and to bring about the consequence that a company was unable to pay the group tax. It is also possible that a jury could reason that it is unlikely that a series of such similar events all be accidents, and that therefore some or all of them must have been intentional. The notice requirements of ss.97 and 98 not having been complied with, or dispensed with, and no judgment having been made that the s.101 test was satisfied, s.95 prohibited that use of the evidence. The evidence might also have given rise to reasoning based on continuity: that is, if it were inferred, for example, that the appellant had the requisite intention in the cases of Budscan and later companies, it might be inferred that he had the same intention in relation to earlier companies. Although s.97 refers to a tendency to have a particular state of mind, it is not clear to me that reasoning on the basis of continuity in such a manner would be reasoning by way of tendency: however, Mr. Fagan in effect conceded that it would be reasoning by way of tendency, and I will proceed on the basis of that concession.  
      
       
     50 The next point to note is that the jury was never invited to reason by way of tendency or coincidence, but, on the contrary, was instructed to consider each count as a separate case. Furthermore, they were instructed that they could use the material in relation to earlier counts in order to support knowledge and intention in relation to later counts, as I have stated to be appropriate. The question then is, should there have been a specific direction that the jury must not use the material by way of tendency evidence or coincidence evidence.  
      
       
     51 In my opinion, it is a matter of fine judgment as to whether such a specific direction would or would not have been helpful to the appellant. It could suggest a way of reasoning that the jury might find persuasive, and even act upon, notwithstanding a direction to the contrary. Furthermore, it could lead to further emphasis being given to the legitimate use of the material to which I have referred, by way of evidence of knowledge and understanding. One conceivable result might be to give the appellant a better chance of acquittal on the earlier charges, but to increase his chance of conviction on the later charges.  
      
       
     52 In relation to such a matter, the judgment of Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial carries some weight, at least unless it is shown to be affected by oversight or incompetence. There is no suggestion here of oversight. The question of whether there has been any material failure by the trial Counsel to act appropriately in the interests of the appellant is to be considered later.  
      
       
     53 Having regard to these considerations, in my opinion, unless the grounds associated with alleged failures of the appellant’s Counsel at the trial are made out, there is no substance in any of these grounds.  
      
       
       DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE 
       
     54 There are a number of grounds of appeal concerning the admission and directions about documentary evidence, especially the coversheets and the bar charts. The relevant grounds are grounds 3, 5, 6 and 11, which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in allowing the tender of the coversheets into evidence in the light of errors and amendment made to the figures in the various categories purporting to analyse the expenditure of funds alleged to have been siphoned from each company subject to indictment by the accused. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         5. His Honour erred in failing to emphasise the question of reliability, as that question relates to the required standard of proof, to be placed by the jury on the accuracy of the coversheet relating to Lymkom Pty Limited given the admitted sparsity and incompleteness of the documents, the passage of time, and the admitted amendments made to the relevant figures pertaining to money received and expended by Lymkom Pty Limited. 
          
          
         6. His Honour erred in failing to appropriately or adequately warn the jury about the reliability, if any, to be given to the coversheet relating to Kindby Pty Limited, Frego Pty Limited and Taureema Pty Limited given the question of inter company loans between the three companies and Conego Pty Limited and given the fact that Conego Pty Limited was not subject to any indictment. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         11. His Honour erred in that he failed to draw the attention of counsel for the Crown and Counsel for the defence to the overlapping time of the first four indictments and the restriction, if any, to be placed on the evidence relating to each indictment. 
         
        
        
       Ground 9, stated earlier, also relates to this matter. 
        
       Submissions 
       
     55 Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted, in relation to ground 3, that there were substantial errors and amendments to the figures making up the coversheets. These, he submitted, put into the question the admissibility of the documents, their weight, and how far their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value.  
      
       
     56 On ground 5, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that Ms. Lapsley’s evidence clearly showed that the deficiency in Lymkom’s records, coupled with the age of the transactions, were such that it would not enable any meaningful analysis and allocation of money received to income and particular kinds of expenditure. In relation to ground 6, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the intertwining of the affairs of Kindby, Frego and Taureema, making necessary the preparation of a single consolidated coversheet, meant that there was no reliability in the evidence capable of supporting convictions in relation to these companies.  
      
       
     57 Mr. Fagan submitted that the cross-examination of Mr. Walton showed that there had been a number of errors in earlier versions of the coversheets, which had been dealt with by revision of the coversheets. The only relevant attack to the coversheets in their form as put before the jury concerned small number of matters, of comparatively small amount.  
      
       
     58 Mr. Fagain submitted that, in relation to Lymkom, Mr. Lapsley’s evidence went no further than to say that the exercise she undertook could not be undertaken in relation to Lymkom: there was no evidence from her criticising the methodology of the accountants who gave evidence for the prosecution. As regards Kindby, Frego and Taureema, separate coversheets were prepared in relation to them, showing the individual defaults in relation to group tax: the combined coversheet was to ensure that the jury had a fair picture of the consolidated income and expenditure of these three companies, disregarding inter-company transactions. 
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     59 In my opinion, Mr. Fagan is correct in his contention that the substantial errors and inaccuracies related to earlier versions of the coversheets, and that the revisions to correct these matters to some extent support the view that the coversheets were the result of careful review and revision. I also accept his submission to the effect that the only relevant errors in relation to the current form of the coversheets were as to a small number of entries, and as to small amounts. There was in fact no dispute as to the amounts of unpaid group tax, as set out in par.[7] above. 
      
       
     60 In those circumstances, I do not think the evidence in question was such that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, within s.137 of the Evidence Act. The appellant’s expert did not attack the methodology of the Crown’s witnesses, and in my opinion her evidence to the effect that she was unable to conduct her exercise in relation to the first four companies did not greatly affect the probative value of the coversheets in relation to those companies.  
      
       
     61 In my opinion also, the attacks on the coversheets and the evidence of Ms. Lapsley was fairly put to the jury in the summing up.  
      
       
     62 Accordingly, in my opinion, these grounds of appeal fail.  
      
       
        
       ALLEGED LACK OF BALANCE 
       
     63 A number of grounds of appeal alleged unfairness in the summing up. I have already referred to ground 10 in particular. The general ground relied on in this respect is ground 7, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         7. In his summing up to the jury His Honour erred in that he emphasised the prosecution’s case in such a way that it was unfair to the accused and lacked judicial balance to the point of rendering the whole trial a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
       
     64 The principal directions concerning the defence case were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The accused's case takes an entirely different focus. It says that the basic analysis in any event is flawed; although, as far as Lymkom is concerned, the defence attack has only pointed, as I understand it, to particular matters said to be errors. It will be a question for you whether you think that those few things that have been pointed out in that particular way, or any of them it has to be said, if accepted really make a difference to the kind of analysis upon which ultimately the Crown relies. To the extent which you think it does make a real difference the reliability of the coversheet does not simply fall to the ground completely; but it certainly is less than what it would otherwise be. To the extent that you think that the particular items criticised in that Lymkom exercise do not make any real difference to the figures at which you need to be looking for purposes of assessing the Crown case as it has been presented, then it has not made its point. 
          
          
         In connection with the number of changes, the evidence is perfectly clear; although what is not so clear, I would suggest to you, is where that actually leaves you. The figures upon which everybody appears to be prepared to proceed are that overall there were some 326 or so changes; and that between the 1st of May and the 8th of June there was some 326 of them. (This is plainly incorrect but I do not have now the correct figures.) But of course those bare statistics do not take the matter very far; for it becomes necessary then to ask, does it not; What is the distribution of those changes? What actually are they? How are they distributed? What do they all add up to? For example, if it proved to be the case that the 326 changes had all been made in one coversheet relating to a series of supporting documents; by one coversheet in connection with one company; that might point in one direction. If the evidence showed that the 326 were spread in a scattered sort of way more or less evenly over all of the analyses supporting all of the company coversheets, that would suggest an entirely different weight and inference. There is grafted on to that, the unchallenged evidence of Mr Walton that, so far as concerns these changes, it has to be remembered that they were in many cases related changes. His evidence is that 326 changes derive in fact from 14 primary changes. He gave, you remember, in his example: SH Lock-one change; 85 ripple effect changes, that sort of thing. The difficulty is that the evidence simply does not take the matter any further than that. It is a matter for you, but you might think that it does not really help simply to appeal rhetorically to the raw figures unless one can say that behind the raw figures is a distribution of error of such a kind as an intelligent mind would accept as indicating fault of a real, fundamental kind in the reliability of the end result - that is, the coversheet itself. It is a matter for you, but that is as far as the evidence goes, as I understand the evidence upon that part of the matter. You will not have over-looked, of course, in connection with that attack exhibit D, which is the schedule of payments actually made by Meriton to these various companies. That will tell you something about what, according to Meriton's records, - and it is not shown that Meriton has any axe to grind in this trial, - were the actual recorded payments from that company to the various companies, Lymkom in particular among them, with which we are concerned. 
          
          
         In connection with the question of intention, a number of submissions was put to you as part of the defence case, and it is necessary that you be reminded of them as follows. 
          
          
         It was said that there were several things the combined effect of which tended to show that the accused could not have had the intent which the Crown has to prove that he did have, in accordance with the essential element that I have set out in the earlier document. In aid of that submission, it was put to you that you would ask: why would he spend more than he should have spent? It was said that he did it because the company was poorly organised. You might accept that that was so. That he was by nature a big spender. That you might think to be a reasonable thing to say. That he had a kind of disconnection from reality and that he had a desire for status. As to the disconnection from reality I will just say this to you. 
          
          
         When you are considering that submission you will need to consider it with a proper precision. You will need to ask what it is that constitutes the reality from which it is said the accused was disconnected. The question is not whether he was endangering anyone. The question is not whether he was overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. The question is: did he not understand that he had the obligation to pay the group tax that he was being paid? That one of the things that was standing in the way of finding the money to pay it were the drawings that he was making out of the company in the way that he accepted, but in particular those funds expended personal, and his own wages. That is a matter for you. Once again, use your common sense. Do you think that it is a reasonable possibility that this man was disconnected in the way that has been suggested from that kind of reality as to what was happening in his company? It is a matter for you. 
          
          
         It was put to you in that connection that you must be satisfied that there is no other rational conclusion than that he set out to overspend in order to strip the companies bare to the intended loss of the Commissioner. It seems to me that that inverts the Crown's case. The Crown's case seems to me to be, not that he set out to overspend, or to strip the companies bare, but that he set out to strip the companies bare in order to overspend and the two things are not the same. The Crown case is that he chronically overspent; that the only way he could do it was to use funds which ought to have been applied in payment of the group tax. So the spending came first; with it the need to find the money; with that need, the opportunity, and the intentional taking of the opportunity as the Crown puts it, to take out of the company monies which should have been used to pay the Commissioner for group tax. 
          
          
         As part of the defence argument it is said that the Taxation Office was relaxed in its pursuit of Lymkom as a company, and of the accused as the person concerned with the direction of Lymkom; and that somehow that relaxation on the part of the Taxation Office goes to this question of intention. It is necessary to think that through carefully. Let us get the starting point right. 
          
          
         We are not conducting an administrative enquiry into the way in which the Taxation Office operates or should operate. There are a lot of things that might be said about what does indeed; I think, seem to have been a quite marked lapse of time by the Taxation Office; but you will need to think through very carefully, not in some reflex reaction to that criticism of the Taxation Office, but to think through carefully where that actually takes you as a matter of reasoning. What does it matter, you might well ask, from the point of view of the obligation of the individual at law to pay the tax, that the tax office does not pursue him? If the case were one where it was being suggested that the tax office had pursued him, and that that had concentrated his mind wonderfully; that he had mended his ways after that experience; then one can understand how it might have been argued that his intention, prior to being pursued by the Taxation Office, was something requiring to be looked at carefully. But that is not this case. All this case discloses is that, for whatever reason, the Taxation Office did not follow up these defaults as promptly as it should have done. 
          
          
         I tell you what I am bound to say: that is a matter of comment upon a matter of fact; and not a direction of law. For myself, I cannot see how that goes at all to the question of the intent of the accused. His obligation was not to pay the tax if he was pursued for it. His obligation was to pay the tax when it fell due. If he knew that it was falling due; that it was not being paid; and that part of the reason why it was not being paid was because of the expenditure as I have discussed it with you, - then for myself, - as I say, it is a matter for you, - I find it difficult to see how it can be said that a relaxed enforcement approach by the Taxation Office really goes at all to that question of intent. But in the end that is a matter for you and not for me. 
          
          
         It was put as well as part of the defence case that relevant to the question of intent was whether or not the accused had walked away from the company, or bought it to an end himself; or had it bought to an end by some creditor or other. The Taxation Office you could see being relevant in relation, not to Lymkom, but to some of the later companies. Once again, you need to think that through carefully. You need to ask whether it really matters in the end. You need to ask whether the real questions are these. 
          
          
         What happened when Lymkom came to an end? Not when it was dissolved, but when it ceased to trade in a real commercial sense, what happened? The Crown case, - you might think amply supported by the evidence of Mrs Place but that is a matter for you, - is that it is perfectly happened: everything was just transferred across, in the way that I discussed, to the next company in line, which I think was Kindby. 
          
          
         On that approach it simply does not matter what the legal technicalities were about the bringing to an end of the company. What matters is what in the real commercial world happened with the movement out of the one company of assets into the fresh one. 
          
          
         It was put that there was no evidence that the accused had, for example, changed the group tax returns, and that is true. It was put that the suggestion that there had been false cheque butts could be refuted by a proper consideration of actually what it was for which the cheques were drawn and paid out. You will have a schedule before you in that regard. And there is nothing I can tell you usefully about that. 
          
          
         You were asked to consider on the question of intention, and it is part of the defence case, what the accused had done. Things the accused had done which were not consistent with a guilty intention of the required kind. You were asked to consider in that respect his borrowing, although much later in time than the time relevant to Lymkom, of one million from Mr Trigubuff in order to square, if I may put it that way, accumulated arrears by that time over a number of companies, up to, and I think including, Milcoy. It was put to you that his attempt to organise that arrangement, although it proved to be fruitless, is some warrant for the view that he did not have at the relevant times the intention to strip these companies in the way made out by the Crown case. Once again, you need to look at that carefully. All the evidence shows is that he made the application for one million; and that for whatever reason, and he doesn't know what the reason was, he was unsuccessful in getting it. Where do you go from there, you have to ask. The case is not one, for example, in which the evidence establishes that he got the million dollars; paid off the arrears; and thereafter had no further arrears. It is not that sort of case, on the evidence. It is not the case that he did not get the million dollars, but thereafter was particular to do what the law required of him in connection with the payment of group tax for the relevant companies in the chain. It is not that sort of case, on the evidence. So you might think that a fair way of putting the point, - but again, this is a matter of fact for you, - is this attempt to get one million from Mr Trigubuff is really neutral, because without more, it doesn't really take you anywhere in a logical kind of progression. That is a matter for you. 
          
          
         In addition to things that he is said to have done or not done, there are things that he said or did not say, in connection with his obligations to pay group tax. Well, Mrs Place gave evidence to which you were referred that he had told her from time to time that he wanted to pay, tried to pay, would do better in the future than in the past. She also said that on occasion she had asked him about it, and he had said simply there wasn't any money to pay for it. That is what the evidence is. Once again it is a matter for you but you might wonder and you have to sift carefully back where he takes you in a substantive logical kind of way. That is a matter for you. Now, I have imposed all of that upon you in connection with a discussion of Lymkom, because those competing arguments, although they vary in matters of fine detail, are really constant competing arguments throughout each of these charges. 
         
        
       
     65 There were further directions concerning Ms. Lapsley’s evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Commencing with the Budscan case, that is to say count 5 in the indictment, it does become necessary to consider Miss Lapsley’s evidence in a much more particular way than I have yet done. And it becomes necessary to consider more particularly her profit and loss accounts, and questions that arise in connection with them. Once again it is necessary may I suggest, to begin by putting in place some kind of structure that will focus your analysis of that material. Can I suggest that again you might ask a series of questions as follows.  
          
         1. What was she actually asked to do?  
          
         2. When was she asked to do it?  
          
         3. What data was provided to her in aid of her task; and what difficulties did she encounter in that connection?  
          
         4. What method did she employ; and insofar as that method rests upon certain assumptions are the assumptions sound? 
          
          
         And finally, if her approach is valid what is the consequence to the Crown case? That seems to me to be a superstructure, if I may so refer to it, of questions which would focus an orderly kind of consideration of Miss Lapsley's evidence. 
          
          
         Let us take the last question first. If it were to be accepted that what she says is correct: that is to say that her method is correct, that her assumptions are correct, that everything necessary to be taken in favour of her analysis is taken in favour of it; then that would do a great deal of damage to the Crown case, because that would entail that the reliability of Mr Walters' analyses would come under question; but it would not necessarily entail that the Crown case had simply collapsed, because, once again, it is not essential to the Crown case, as I understand it, that absolutely every fast item in every coversheet be accepted. What is essential to the Crown case is that it be accepted that it is possible to estimate fairly and reliably the amounts that were being taken out of the companies successively by the accused; and, as I have said before, to juxtapose that with the amount of arrears of group tax, and in particular with the final debit of group tax arrears. 
          
          
         What was she actually asked to do? I want to answer that, and some of the successive questions, by brief references to what she herself said, rather than to paraphrase it and risk not putting it to you accurately. She said at 599 what she had been asked to do in relation to each of the exercises that she had carried out. And this is what she said:  
          
           
           ""A. I was asked to have a look at the coversheet and to try and construct a different position of how the company was operating. As I said I cannot do a true position so I have tried to apply fairly what I thought would be normal operating average percentages for a company in this area.""  
           
          
          
         Can you just look at that a little more carefully. 
          
           
           ""A. I was asked to have a look at the coversheet and to try and construct a different position of how the company was operating."" 
           
          
          
         That is the first thing. She then goes on to say, - as you will recall, I am sure, she said a number of times, - that her basic concept of what an accountant in her position should be doing in such a context was to strive to reproduce what she called a true and fair analysis; that it could not be true in the sense that it could not be done in a way that was confidently accurate and precise to the fast detail, because a combination of age and some records made that impossible. But that at least in those cases where she did produce a Profit and Loss Account, that represented her best effort at producing something which, if not true in that pedantic narrow sense, was at least fair in terms of an overview of the operations of the relevant company. ""I was asked to have a look at the coversheet and to try and construct a different position of how the company was operating."" 
          
          
         When was she asked to do it? She gave evidence on the Monday, and her evidence was that she had been asked, not on the preceding Friday, but on the Friday before that. She was asked what data had been given to her in connection with her task, and that is a matter of some importance. What would be the sort of records you would want to get to be absolutely confident as an accountant? She says: 
          
           
           ""A. I want every piece of paper that goes into running a company. All prime source documents such as invoices, receipts, contracts, quotes for contracts, are all important elements of arriving at an opinion about a Profit and Loss Account and the balance sheet."" 
           
          
          
         She said she was lucky if 5 percent of the work that she did ever measured up to that standard; and she said the rest of the materials that normally found their way across her desk were incomplete in one form or another. She was asked: 
          
           
           ""Q. How would you describe the source material that you had for the purpose of looking at the company Budscan?"" 
           
          
          
         May I pause there, she is being asked about Budscan because that was the first in sequence of the profit and loss accounts that she carried out; but what she had to say in that regard did not vary in connection with the subsequent companies as to which she did produce a Profit and Loss Account. She says: 
          
           
           ""A. In a true accountant sense I had no prime source documents. For example, I did not have invoices. I did not have receipts. I did not have contracts and I didn't even have original bank statements, deposit slips, cheque butts or cheques. I have photocopies and that is often not acceptable in a good accounting situation. Original documents are preferred and need I say, are definitely required by the Tax Office in the event of any form of investigation or audit. So, in a true sense for accounting purposes original records are always required."" 
           
          
          
         That is her description of the position in which she found herself in terms of materials available to her in carrying out her accounting task. What method did she employ? It is simple enough and you will see it on the face of the profit and loss accounts. 
          
         She assumed the companies that with the turnover respectively of the various companies with which she was concerned, could not possibly be running in a way which left such comparatively small amounts assigned to those particular items as to which she preferred to use what she said were in her experience representative averages. I need not go to the fine detail of it: you will have it in exhibit 2. But it is the subcontractor, equipment hire, materials, subcontractor/equipment, hire/materials entry, and other business/deductible operating expenses which are the two items which are constantly adjusted by her. She adjusts them upon the basis that a fair representative allowance would be 25 percent in the case of the subcontractor equipment hire materials in respect of the other business deductible operating expenses. Again the fine detail you can see for yourself. The important point to take hold of is that those assumptions entail a treatment of those items in away that increases them very substantially over Mr Walters' analysis. By a factor of three or four times in some, if not in perhaps all, of those cases. 
          
          
         The criticism made of that was put fairly and squarely in cross-examination and it is in the end simple enough. It is that if you look at the way in which her assumptions work out in the state of the knowledge that we do have of the movement of funds in terms and that turned out of these companies it just cannot be right. Representative average or no representative average, that her 25 percent and 10 percent cannot be valid because there would not be enough money available in the company, and in the relevant companies, to fund that sort of level of expenditure. In the end that is as good an illustration as I can give you of a question of fact which you have to decide. You saw and-heard her, you heard that criticism put to her, you heard from herself at the end of her cross-examination this proposition. She was asked this question by the Crown Prosecutor. It was his closing question:  
          
           
           Q. Going back to these coversheets - I don't want to ask you to look at any of them, just take this as a general proposition, would you agree with me that if the business expenses properly attributable to running the bricklaying operations were relatively low, of the order which are attributed to these various coversheets, if they were available, then the absence of funds in the companies to meet the group tax liabilities is substantially accounted for by the personal expenditure to Mr Walters?  
            
           A. As given on the coversheets, yes."" 
           
          
          
         And that goes back yet again to that proposition which lies at the heart of the Crown case. That in the end, after all the adjustments have been made, the question is: was there taken out of the company in those two categories money which, if it had been left in the company, would have been sufficient to pay the group tax arrears; and is it a fair inference, and indeed is it the only fair inference at the end of the day, that he did not leave the money in the company but continued to spend it on his personal or business expenditure, having in mind that that would entail that the arrears were not paid, and that that was just unfortunate from the point of view of the revenue. That continues, always, to be the centre of the Crown case just as it continues, always, to be the centre of the defence case that that is too strict a view; that he did not understand, and therefore did not really intend, any such thing. 
         
        
       
     66 There were further directions concerning Mr. Jack: 
      
       
        
         
         For my present purpose the important part of that passage is the submission: 
          
          
         ""But the point is the accused is at a disadvantage because the precise relationship that existed between the accused and Mr Jack cannot be identified."" 
          
          
         I want to say some things to you about that. They are important; and because I cannot give them to you in writing for the reason I explained, I want to ask you in a very particular way to attend to what I say and to make a note, those of you who can do that, so that in the jury room you will have clearly in front of you these propositions. 
          
          
         One: it was submitted correctly that you have not had the advantage of seeing and hearing Mr Jack. It is essential to understand that you may not speculate in any way whatsoever as to what Mr Jack might or might not, or could or could not, have said had he been called to give evidence. That feeds back into something that I said to you at the very early stages of the summing up, and it is important, so important. You will remember that I told you that I would be surprised if you don't find yourselves more than once at a point in your considerations where you were faced simply with a gap in the evidence; and that if there was a gap, well there was a gap, and you couldn't fill it by conjuring evidence out of thin air; that you had to exercise your powers of good sense and good judgment on the evidence that you do in fact have. Here is a precise illustration of that point. There will be a very obvious and understandable temptation to say ""Well look; I think I have got an idea of what Mr Jack might have said if he had been called”; and you must be on your guard against that. He wasn't called. We don't know what he would have said. We have no way of knowing it, and there it is. The one thing you can't do is speculate about what he might have said had he been called. Please be careful about that. 
          
          
         Proposition 2. It was submitted, correctly, that the evidence discloses that it is not the fault of the Crown that Mr Jack was not called to give evidence. You were told, correctly, that all reasonable efforts to locate him had been made and had been fruitless. It doesn't matter why. What matters is that that is the fact. 
          
          
         Thirdly. You heard upon those premises, the proposition that I read to you just a moment ago. Now that submission of unfair disadvantage to the accused by reason of the absence of Mr Jack cannot, in my view, be allowed to stand without some proper comment being made about it, for your assistance, in deciding as you will have to do, what weight you are prepared to give to that submission. For the weight that you are prepared to give to that submission goes to the very heart of your consideration, not indeed of all of these ten companies, but certainly of the fast two of them in the sequence with which you are concerned, that is to say Aloprom, count 9 and AJ, count 10. 
          
          
         I want to suggest for your consideration that you should take into account these matters. First, you have had no in-Court explanation from the accused of his role, if any, of the management and control of the affairs of Aloprom and AJ. That is the first thing to take note of. 
          
          
         Secondly, he was, and is, under no obligation to give an in-Court explanation. In that connection I remind you, but without repeating them, of the directions of law that I gave you in the general directions section yesterday. 
          
          
         Thirdly, the Crown is as entitled to a fair trial as is the accused. You should consider carefully therefore, and before you do in fact accept the submission made by counsel for the accused, whether you are prepared to accept as fair, and as deserving of weight in your view as sole judges of the facts, the submission that the absence of Mr Jack has placed the accused in a position of unfair disadvantage. You might well think that in the circumstances as I have now outlined them for you, it would not be fair to accept at face value that particular submission. I am bound however to tell you, as I do plainly, that that is a comment of mine upon a matter of fact and not a direction of law. You are therefore free to take it up or to leave it alone as you think fit; but for the reasons to which I have referred, I don't think that I would properly do my job of seeing that there is a fair trial from everybody's point of view if I did not at least bring those matters to your attention and suggest that at the very least you should consider them. Whether or not, having considered them, you give effect to them is, as I say again, a matter of fact for you and not a matter of law for me. Is all of that clear ladies and gentlemen? 
          
         THE JURY RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     67 Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that these directions were dismissive of the defence case, and did not put it fairly: Green v. The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 34; Cleland v. The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 10.  
      
       
     68 Mr. Fagan submitted that a significant part of the appellant’s case was to suggest that Mr. Walton’s analysis of income and expenditure was not reliable and the particular complaints were put to the jury company by company in the course of summing up. The defence case was properly put, and any comments on it were not inappropriate and were qualified by the direction that the view the jury took about the matter was entirely up to them.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     69 In my opinion, the substance of the defence case was fairly put, particularly in the quoted passages. In my opinion, the trial judge’s comments were not inappropriate, and were appropriately qualified. 
      
       
        
       ALLEGED FAILURES OF COUNSEL 
       
     70 The following grounds relate to alleged failures by the appellant’s Counsel, both in support of earlier grounds (as indicated earlier) and also as independent grounds of appeal. The relevant grounds are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         11A. Despite specific instructions given to Defence Counsel prior to the hearing regarding the Appellant’s life style, ownership of luxury motor vehicles, boats, overseas holidays and other personal expenditure in the years prior to 1989 Defence Counsel failed to call evidence in response to the Crown’s case against the Appellant on the question of expenditure relating to life style, ownership of luxury motor vehicles, boats, overseas holidays and other personal expenditure generally. 
          
          
         11B. Despite specific instructions given to Defence Counsel prior to the hearing as to the method and manner in which the Appellant operated his bricklaying business with Meriton Apartments (giving Defence Counsel names of these prior companies and the approximate number of employees) prior to the period covered by the indictment, Defence Counsel failed to call the following evidence in response to the Crown case regarding each of the ten companies named in the indictment – the names, the period of operation, the method and manner of operation and the number of employees of each of the prior companies. 
         
        
        
        
       Evidence 
       
     71 Evidence on this matter was led on appeal. There was affidavit evidence from the appellant, from Mr. Adamson his solicitor at the trial, and from Dr. Bishop his Counsel at the trial. There was some cross-examination of Mr. Adamson by Mr. Fagan.  
      
       
     72 It was common ground in this evidence that the appellant gave instructions to Mr. Bishop to the effect that, prior to the period of the charges, he had enjoyed a similar lifestyle and incurred similar personal expenditure (including motor vehicles, boats, and overseas holidays) without tax problems; and also to the effect that the business was frequently underpaid by Meriton Apartments. A statement by the appellant taken by Mr. Bishop was tendered, but the appellant did not give evidence of what evidence he would have given, if called, in relation to the subject matter of the charges. It was also common ground that slides of figures, presumably the coversheets, were shown to the jury during the opening, and not objected to.  
      
       
     73 Mr. Adamson gave evidence that Mr. Bishop had instructions to apply for separate trials of each count, and did not do so; that he advised the appellant that the evidence of his lifestyle had nothing to do with the case, which was based entirely on tendency and coincidence evidence of a type that would not be allowed; and that, if the Crown was allowed to develop a case based on the appellant’s extravagant lifestyle, he would introduce evidence of the appellant’s prior dealings through Ms. Place and the appellant’s daughter. The appellant gave evidence that Dr. Bishop had said he would object to evidence of the extravagant lifestyle and that those objections would be successful. Mr. Bishop denied these allegations.  
      
       
        
       Submissions 
       
     74 Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the danger of prejudice from the joinder of all the counts and the way the evidence was presented in the bar charts and the coversheets were extremely prejudicial to the appellant, so that the failure of Counsel to seek separate trials and/or take appropriate steps to avoid prejudice amounted to incompetence. It was incompetent for Counsel not to have called evidence to the effect that the appellant’s lifestyle had not changed from that which existed prior to the period of the charges, and of the problems in getting full payment from Meriton. 
      
       
     75 Mr. Fagan submitted that the failure to seek separate trials, and the failure to take more objections in relation to overlapping evidence and to seek specific direction concerning tendency and coincidence evidence, did not indicate incompetence.  
      
       
     76 As regards the evidence concerning the appellant’s lifestyle and dealings with Meriton, Mr. Fagan submitted that this material could only effectively have been presented by calling the appellant and thereby opening up cross-examination of the appellant in relation to large unidentified amounts which had not been attributed to private expenditure, as well as concerning the matter generally. Dr. Bishop’s evidence was that it would be unthinkable to have called the appellant: this was a considered decision, not an oversight, and one that could not be regarded as incompetent.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     77 In so far as there is a conflict in the evidence between Dr. Bishop on the one hand, and Mr. Adamson and the appellant on the other, I prefer the evidence of Dr. Bishop. I think it is improbable in the extreme that Dr. Bishop would have advised that the lifestyle evidence could be successfully objected to, or that the Crown case was based upon tendency and coincidence evidence. I think it is also unlikely that Dr. Bishop would have undertaken, if lifestyle evidence was allowed, to lead evidence of the appellant’s prior dealings, and then not do so. Dr. Bishop’s evidence was called by the appellant, and there was no application on behalf of the appellant to cross-examine him.  
      
       
     78 In my opinion, substantially for reasons already given, there can be no inference of incompetence drawn from the failure to seek separate trials of different counts, the failure to exclude the documentary evidence, or the failure to apply for additional directions concerning tendency and coincidence evidence. 
      
       
     79 Mr. Abdul-Karim accepted that, in order satisfactorily to present evidence as to the appellant’s lifestyle prior to the periods of the charges and as to underpayment by Meriton Apartments, it would have been necessary to call the appellant. This would of course have exposed the appellant to cross-examination in the way referred to in Mr. Fagan’s submissions. In my opinion, the evidence would in any event have been of small assistance to the appellant’s case: it would have left untouched the evidence of warnings by the accountant as to the consequences of the appellant’s expenditure from assets of the earlier companies, and the knowledge of those consequences gained through the failure of those earlier companies with massive debts to the Commissioner.  
      
       
     80 In all these circumstances I would not draw any inference of incompetence from a decision not to call the appellant, let alone an inference of incompetence of the nature discussed in R v. Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Furthermore, in my opinion, if it is wished to rely on a failure to call an accused person as a ground for alleging that a trial has miscarried, it is incumbent upon the appellant in such cases to give detailed evidence as to the substantive evidence that the appellant would have given if called. That has not occurred in this case. 
      
       
     81 For these reasons, in my opinion these grounds of appeal fail. 
      
       
        
       OTHER GROUNDS 
       
     82 The remaining grounds, which I have not yet dealt with, are grounds 11C-11G, and 11J. They are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         11C. Given the emphasis placed by the Crown in presenting its case in against the Appellant’s lifestyle, ownership of luxury motor vehicles, boats, overseas holidays, use of drivers and other person expenditure, His Honour erred in failing to inquire or draw to the attention of Defence Counsel to the question of the Appellant’s lifestyle and ownership of motor vehicles, boats, overseas holidays, use of drivers and other personal expenditure prior to 1989. 
          
          
         11D. Given the evidence that each of the ten companies named in the indictment conducted most if not all of its bricklaying business with Meriton Apartments, His Honour's failure to draw to the attention of Counsel for the Crown and Counsel for the Defence the Appellant's dealings with Meriton Apartments and the manner and method of any such dealings before January 1989 and such failure amounted to an error tantamount to a denial of procedural fairness. 
          
          
         11E. His Honour erred in that he failed to consider or raise with Counsel for the Crown and Counsel for the Defence the relevance, if any, of the question of amendments to the Taxation Laws and Regulations during the period covered by the indictment and how those amendments reflected on the question of a company and its directors' obligations to make Group Tax and PAYE tax payments from time to time. 
          
          
         11F. His Honour erred in that He failed to consider or raise with Counsel for the Crown and Counsel for the Defence during the evidence led by the Crown from Dianne Ruby Reynolds (tp 164) the question whether during the period covered by the indictment, Meriton Apartments had any legal obligation to deduct Tax or PAYE Tax from payments to the appellant pursuant to contracts with the Appellant with the companies named in the indictment and also whether any deductions were in fact made from the invoices submitted by the Appellant and the reason(s) for any such deductions. 
          
          
         11G. Defence Counsel failed to act in accordance with specific instructions to inform the Court at some appropriate time that the three other counsel who sat with Defence Counsel from time to time during the trial were in fact Readers and were not part of the Defence legal team paid or renumerated (sic) in any way by the Appellant. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         11J His Honour erred when he failed to ensure that the indictments were properly read out to the Appellant as presented to the Court by the Crown thereby causing confusion to the Appellant when making his pleas on the question of whether the intent to defraud was alleged to be that of the company named in each count or that of the Appellant. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     83 In relation to grounds 11C to 11F, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the trial judge’s failure to raise with both the Crown and defence Counsel the matters referred to under the previous heading, and also the question whether Meriton Apartments was under any legal obligation to retain funds from payments to the appellant to be forwarded to the Tax Commissioner, amounted to a miscarriage of justice. He submitted that this followed from the trial judge’s position as the Tribunal of Law in the running of the trial, and from the importance of these questions to all ten counts.  
      
       
     84 In relation to ground 11G, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the defence Counsel’s appearance with three other robed Counsel would have given the jury a false impression of affluence of the appellant. It was never explained to the jury that they were readers, appearing without payment for their own education.  
      
       
     85 In relation to ground 11J, the transcript of proceedings when the appellant was arraigned before the jury records the charges being read out differently from the way they appear in the indictment, and set out in par.[1], in that the word “was” is omitted and the word “defrauded” appears instead of “defrauding”. Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that this caused confusion.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     86 As to grounds 11C to 11F, there is in my opinion no substance in these submissions. In the circumstances of this case, there was no obligation on the trial judge to intervene in the way suggested.  
      
       
     87 As regards ground 11G, the circumstances referred to do not in my opinion raise any possibility of a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     88 As regards ground 11J, in my opinion the differences are probably errors in the transcript. Even if they are not, the meaning of what was recorded as being read to the jury was clear, even if the expression is ungrammatical. Plainly, the allegation was that the respective companies defrauded the Commonwealth and that the appellant was knowingly concerned in this. 
      
       
        
       SENTENCE GROUNDS 
       
     89 The grounds relied on in the application for leave to appeal in respect of sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         12. His Honour erred in considering the measure of cumulation for Counts 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 to be based on the more frequent shuffling of companies commencing in Count 5 relating to Budscan Pty Limited and as an indication of culpability. 
          
          
         13. His Honour erred in that he failed to take into consideration in the imposition of sentence the prisoner’s history of 31 years as a hard working responsible, law abiding, citizen and reflect that history in either reduction of the head sentence on each count or waiving of the measure of cumulation. 
          
          
         14. His Honour erred in taking into account other offences relating to breaches of restraining order made on 13 May 1998, after the prisoner’s arrest when on a global view the said breaches directly relate to the indictments subject to the 10 charges for which the prisoner was tried.  
          
          
         15. In imposing sentence His Honour erred in placing greater emphasis on the question of deterrence than the prospect of rehabilitation. 
          
          
         16. In imposing sentence His Honour placed undue emphasis on the fact that the prisoner did not give evidence either at the trial or the hearing on sentence as some sort of indicators from which adverse inferences could be drawn on the questions of lack of contrition, degree of culpability, and honesty. 
          
          
         17. His Honour erred in not requesting a pre-sentence report to enable him to take into consideration subjective features of the prisoner’s life including the prisoner’s views on the questions of remorse and contrition. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     90 In relation to ground 12, Mr Abdul-Karim submitted that the appellant was not a director of the companies referred to in counts 6 to 10, and that the trial judge wrongly took this as indicating increased culpability, in that he was concealing his position as controller of the companies. He submitted that in fact, due to the failure of the earlier companies, the appellant could not be a director; and also, the fact that he was not a director meant that the “shuffling” of these companies was not entirely within his control.  
      
       
     91 As regards ground 13, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the sentences were such as to show that the appellant’s good character had not been appropriately taken into account. Furthermore, the trial judge did not consider alternatives to full-time custody.  
      
       
     92 As regards ground 14, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the trial judge erred in treating the five breaches of restraining order as relevant to the appellant’s culpability in relation to the offences for which he was tried and convicted. 
      
       
     93 As regards ground 15, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the trial judge failed to consider whether a lesser or different sentence would better promote rehabilitation, especially having regard to the appellant’s age and the unlikelihood that he could work again upon release from the sentences actually imposed. He submitted that the primary judge also failed appropriately to take into account hardship to the appellant’s seven year old son, whose mother had died when he was five months old.  
      
       
     94 As regards ground 16, Mr. Abdul-Karim submitted that the trial judge wrongly drew adverse inferences from the appellant’s failure to give evidence at the trial or in the sentencing procedure.  
      
       
     95 Finally, as regards ground 17, Mr Abdul-Karim submitted that the appellant’s Counsel or the trial judge should have requested a pre-sentence report, and the failure to do so contravenes s.16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act. Such a report would have been important in relation to such matters as the position of the appellant’s son, and remorse and contrition. 
      
       
     96 Mr. Fagan SC submitted that the appellant’s Counsel had conceded that a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate; and that a pre-sentence report was generally required where there was a real question of alternatives to full-time custodial sentence. 
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     97 As regards ground 12, in my opinion the sentencing remarks do not suggest that the primary judge treated the appellant’s culpability as increased by the use of others as directors. He proceeded on the basis that, although the appellant was not a director of the later companies, he did have effective control of them; and this was clearly justified by the jury’s verdict and by the evidence. His decision to cumulate sentences as he did was in my opinion an appropriate exercise of his discretion and did not lead to an excessive sentence over all.  
      
       
     98 As regards ground 13, the appellant’s good character was explicitly taken into account, and in my opinion the sentences are not such as to suggest it was not given appropriate weight. As regards ground 14, in my opinion it was appropriate for the trial judge to take the other offences into account as he did, pursuant to s.16BA of the Crimes Act.  
      
       
     99 As regards ground 15, in my opinion, the trial judge did take into account the relevant matters. As regards ground 16, the trial judge did not draw any adverse inference from the failure of the appellant to give evidence: rather, he said in effect that he was unable to afford any leniency to the appellant based on contrition, because no evidence of contrition had been given. Finally, in my opinion, the absence of a pre-sentence report did not in any way vitiate the sentencing procedure. 
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     100 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
      
       
       1. Appeal against convictions dismissed. 
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentences refused. 
        
       
     101 STUDDERT J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     102 DOWD J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hodgson JA in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and His Honour’s reasons.

      Judgment 
       
       
     1 STEIN JA : I agree with O’Keefe J. 
      
       
     2 O’KEEFE J: Hakija Sinanovic (the appellant) has appealed against his conviction on 25 May 2001 in respect of a charge laid under s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. The conviction was by a judge of the District Court (the trial judge) who by consent heard and determined the matter without a jury. On 28 May, 2001 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 2 April 2002 with a non-parole period of two months to expire on 2 June 2002.  
      
       
     3 The section under which the appellant was charged provides that: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
           “Whosoever having … received any money … upon terms requiring him … to … pay to any person the whole or any part of : 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) such money … fraudulently misappropriates to his … own use or the use of another person, … such money or valuable security, shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     4 The indictment against the appellant alleged that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Between 1 July 1995 and 30 November 1995 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales having received certain money, namely the sum of $27,800 upon terms requiring him, the said Hakija Sinanovic to pay the same by investing in the acquisition for Tina Ruello of an interest in a restaurant known as “Stella” fraudulently did misappropriate to his own use the said money in violation of the terms upon which he the said Hakija Sinanovic so received the said money.” 
         
        
       
     5 The history of the matter is that the appellant had previously stood trial and been convicted for the same offence on an indictment in terms identical to that set out in paragraph 3 above. He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which set the conviction aside and ordered a new trial. No point was taken in relation to the form of the indictment either at the first trial or on appeal, nor was any adverse comment made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the form of the indictment. Likewise, at the second trial there was no demurrer to the indictment, nor was any point taken in relation to its form. At the end of the Crown case, a submission was made that the only evidence before the Court was “the entrusting of certain funds to the defendant with a view to his investing it” and that the Crown “have not shown the defendant was in any way dishonest … there is nothing to show any criminality on the part of the defendant.”. It was not until amended grounds of appeal were filed on 25 February 2002 that any point was taken in relation to the form of the indictment. The amended grounds of appeal sought to raise an additional ground as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         3. That the court (sic) in the indictment did not disclose any offence under s 178A of the Crimes Act and accordingly was bad. 
         
        
       
     6 By notice of motion filed on 5 March 2002 the appellant gave notice that the court would be moved on the date fixed for the hearing of the appeal to substitute for the grounds of appeal already filed, grounds of appeal as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The charge upon which the appellant was convicted was not a charge known to law. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in misdirecting himself as to the elements of the charge laid under s 178A. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in not entering a verdict of not guilty as requested, following the completion of the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.” 
         
        
        
       At the hearing of the appeal the fourth ground of appeal was said to be subsumed into grounds 1 to 3. 
        
       
     7 The facts as found by the trial judge were that at the times material to the charge there were four persons, who, as partners, were the owners of the Stella restaurant. They were Mrs Tina Ruello (as assignee of her son Massimo Ruello), Renato Falvo, Czaro Falvo and Josney Maruca. 
      
       
     8 Mrs Ruello, a lady of 78 years, had first met the appellant some ten years prior to 1994 or 1995. She came into closer contact with him again in either 1994 or 1995. At that time she was working as a cook at the Stella restaurant in Crown Street, Darlinghurst, and had been so working for approximately 18 years. The restaurant had originally been owned by four people, namely: Renato Falvo, Czaro Falvo, Johnny Maruca and Massimo Ruello, the son of Mrs Ruello. In either 1988 or 1989, Mrs Ruello’s son was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident as a result of which he suffered brain damage. His share in the restaurant was later assigned to his mother who thereafter received a small income from the business.  
      
       
     9 The other three partners of the restaurant business were anxious to sell. The appellant was aware of this and discussed the prospective sale of the restaurant with Mrs Ruello. She was anxious to buy the restaurant and the appellant told her that they could buy it together as partners. At the time, Mrs Ruello had approximately $32,000 in savings in Australia and a further $26,000 in Italy. By various means the appellant convinced Mrs Ruello to give him $27,800 with which to buy out the other partners and thus gain ownership of the restaurant business. He also convinced her to arrange for her monies in Italy to be sent to an account which the appellant opened in Mrs Ruello’s name, and to put the monies in the bank pending the finalisation of the purchase of the restaurant. In addition, he convinced Mrs Ruello to lend him $3,000.  
      
       
     10 Fortunately for Mrs Ruello, the savings she had in Italy did not come back to Australia in time for the appellant to receive them, but the other monies which had been paid by Mrs Ruello to him for the purchase of the restaurant were used by the appellant for his own purposes and lost to Mrs Ruello. Of the total of $30,800 which she had paid to the appellant, being $27,800 with which to purchase the shares of the other partners in the restaurant business and the loan of $3,000, all she received back was $1,500, although after she had requested the return of her monies, she was promised $15,000 to $18,000 by a specified date as a first instalment of the refund to be made by the appellant.  
      
       
     11 The trial judge detailed the means by which the appellant convinced Mrs Ruello to pay to him the amount of $27,800 for the purchase of the shares of the other three partners in the restaurant business. These means included opening the bank account referred to above. This was said to be so that the money from Italy could be transferred into it for the purposes of the purchase of the restaurant and, in the meantime, would be able to be pointed to as evidencing that she had money in the bank. This, he said, would be material to assist in the purchase.  
      
       
     12 Because the total amount required for the purchase was approximately two million dollars, Mrs Ruello asked where the rest of the money was to come from. The appellant assured her that between the time she gave him her money for the purchase of the restaurant business and the time at which it was to be used for such purchase, he would double it for her. In addition, as a means of further convincing her to part with her money, the appellant gave Mrs Ruello a number of bank notes from Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Greece. These were of high denomination. The worth of these notes was asserted by him to be “two may be three million”. He further said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is for the restaurant. Two million he said, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Crown Prosecutor: Q. So he gave you some pieces of paper saying they were worth 2 million? 
          
         A. Yes, yes it was, we already have the money for the restaurant. 
          
          
         His Honour: He said that? 
          
         A. He said. 
          
          
         Q. He said that, “We already have the money for the restaurant”? 
          
         A. He said “Why are you worrying about the bank book when you have so much more than you gave me”. Then I went to the bank and was told -- 
          
          
         Crown Prosecutor: Would you have a look at these notes? (Shown). Have you seen them before? 
          
         A. Yes, they were like that. 
          
          
         Q. And these were the notes he said were worth two million? 
          
         A. Yes, he said they were two million for the restaurant …”  
         
        
       
     13 Whereas the appellant asserted that the notes were valuable and that “we already have the money for the restaurant”, in fact the notes were worthless. For example, the Bolivian notes had no value whatsoever outside Bolivia, and even inside Bolivia were of no value beyond 90 days of the date of issue, a time which had passed when the notes were given by the appellant to Mrs Ruello.  
      
       
     14 The trial judge held that the notes were given to Mrs Ruello by the appellant “to allay her fears and … dishonestly with an intent to obtain the money he knew she had”. 
      
       
     15 The trial judge also held that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant received the money from Mrs Ruello specifically for the purpose of investing it in the acquisition of the Stella Restaurant, but that the appellant failed to do so.  
      
       
     16 The case for the appellant was that the indictment presented against the appellant charged an offence unknown to the law. It was submitted that it did not specify the name or names of any person or persons to whom the monies in question were to be paid. This was essential, so the argument ran, for a charge under s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. The argument proceeded that when a proper analysis of the evidence was undertaken, it was clear that the monies paid by Mrs Ruello to the appellant were paid for the purposes of investment, rather than on terms requiring the appellant to pay such money “to any person” and that if any offence was revealed by the evidence, it was an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. No such offence had been charged and a conviction for an offence under such section is not an alternative open to the court when dealing with a charge under s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. (Andrews v The Queen (1968) 126 CLR 198 at 211) 
      
       
     17 In support of his argument, counsel for the appellant drew attention to several passages in the evidence of Mrs Ruello relating the terms of conversations between her and the appellant. Those passages stressed on behalf of the appellant are set out in bold type. However they need to be read in context. One of the conversations between the appellant and Mrs Ruello took place either at her place or at the appellant’s place some two or three days after her son’s birthday: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: Did you ever have conversations with the accused about the restaurant? 
          
         A: Yes. He asked me about the fact that the restaurant was up for sale. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q: What did you say to him with regard to the fact that the restaurant was up for sale? 
          
         A: He said to me: ‘we can buy it together’. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Did you have sufficient money to buy the restaurant with him? 
          
         A: Well, in fact, when he mentioned buying the restaurant, I said to him: ‘I haven’t got the money’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: What was his response to that? 
          
         A: He said that if I had some money, he was working in a bank, that he would double the money. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Did he explain to you how the money could be doubled? 
          
         A: Well, he said he was working in a bank and that it was possible to do it, it was his job to do it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: When he suggested purchasing the restaurant, who did he say would be the owners of the restaurant? 
          
         A: What? Restaurant? What do you mean? 
         
        
        
         
         Q: You have been telling us about the restaurant being up for sale, and that he suggested purchasing it. 
          
         A: Yes. The two of us were going to buy it.”  
         
        
        
       and 
        
        
         
         “Q: Did the accused tell you, or did you know, how much the restaurant was up for sale? 
          
         A: Approximately two million because of the property. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Is that two million Australian dollars? 
          
         A: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: You have told us that you had 31 or 32,000 in savings in the house and you have told us you had 26,000 in Italy? 
          
         A: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Did the accused make any suggestion to you, suggestions how the balance of that $2 million would be made up? 
          
         A: He said he would think of what was missing  
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: That is what he said to her, “I would think of what is missing”. Is that what she is saying? 
         
        
        
         
         Interpreter: It is in third person. She said: “He would think of what is missing, finding. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: So that is her answer. He said “I would think of what was missing.”  
         
        
       
     18 After the conversations referred to above there was a further conversation between the appellant and Mrs Ruello about the necessity to open a bank account. Prior to the signing of the documents necessary for the transfer of the money Mrs Ruello had in Italy to an account at the Bank which she opened at the behest of the appellant, she was told by the appellant that the reason for the transfer of the money from Italy was:  
      
       
        
         
         “… because he said, ‘get the money to be transferred over here so you can purchase’”.  
         
        
        
         
         Q: For what purpose was that money being sent over? 
          
         A: Because the money would be added to the money that we had here because he said that the money would be needed to purchase the restaurant.” 
         
        
       
     19 Mrs Ruello also handed to the appellant an additional amount of $1,800. She said that this was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Because  
         it would have returned a lot more than what I gave him  
         and because the money was needed for the purchase.”  
         
        
       
     20 In cross examination, Mrs Ruello was asked a number of questions which sought to establish that the monies which she gave to the appellant were given for the purpose of investment in a general sense. This can be seen from the following passages which were relied on on behalf of the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: When you went to the Bank, and you opened the bank account, you trusted him that day, did you? 
          
         A: Yes of course, I always trusted him in the sense that he made me believe many things. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Did you ever cease to have any trust in him? 
          
         A: Well, after he deprived me of all my money, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Until while you were giving him the money, you were quite happy to trust him? 
          
         A: Well, happy – I was happy that I may be able to buy my share in the restaurant as he promised me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: What was he going to do? He was going to lend you the money to buy this share in the restaurant? 
          
         A: I had told him I didn’t have much money. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q: The question was, was he going to lend you the money? 
          
         A: He said, that little amount I had was going to be enough  
         because he would have invested it in a fruitful way so that it eventually would be enough to the purchase. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q:  
         How much money did you give him for investment then? 
          
         A: The first time I gave him $3,000, then I gave him 1,800, then I gave him $26,000. That was the day he was wearing the emerald jacket, and put the money in his internal pocket. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q: You gave him $3,000  
         for investment 
         ?  
          
         A: No, he asked for a loan. He said he had payments to make.  
         
        
        
         
         Q: A little while ago you said that that was  
         the money  
         you gave him for investment; 3,000, 1,800 and 26,000? 
          
         A: Well I thought I was lending him the money because he would return it to me but also the investment we were talking about… 
         
        
        
         
         Q: The $26,000 you gave him was also initially a loan? 
          
         A: No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Not a loan? 
          
         A: No, he said we have to have some money in that account because on the day of the auction we would have to show that we had some money in the Bank. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: What was going to happen to the $26,000? 
          
         A: That if we waited for the Italian money to come over here as well we would have put together the two amounts and would have had some money to use in that account. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Let me get this very clear, you were giving him the $26,000 to do what? 
          
         A: To buy, to buy. I have said it I don’t know how many times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Why did you give him the $26,000? 
          
         A: He asked me for the bank book because he was saying that he had to put the money in it so that on the day of the auction we would be able to show we had some money in the bank. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Why did she (sic) give him the 26,000, to do what with it? 
          
         A: To buy my share of Stella.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     21 In relation to the amount of $26,000 which was handed over to the appellant, Mrs Ruello also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: Did you hand over $26,000? 
          
         A: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: Why did you do that? 
          
         A: Well, actually … for the same reason, because we had to purchase the restaurant,  
         because he wanted to put the money in the bank 
         .”  
         
        
       
     22 The totality of the evidence makes it clear, as the trial judge found, that Mrs Ruello gave $27,800 to the appellant for the purposes of purchasing the Stella Restaurant from the existing partners so that she and he would become the owners, as sole partners. Such a purchase involved buying the shares of the other three partners. The money for the purchase was to be paid to them in order to acquire their interests in the restaurant. It was for payment to them for their shares that the monies, other than the loan for $3,000, were given by Mrs Ruello to the appellant. 
      
       
     23 The trial judge stated the elements of the offence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1.) that the accused received the sum of $27,800 between 1 July 1995 and 30 November 1995; (2.) that he received the money upon terms requiring him to pay the money by investing in the acquisition for Tina Ruello of an interest in a restaurant known as Stella; and (3.) he fraudulently did misappropriate the said money to his own use in violation of the said terms.” 
         
        
       
     24 In his attack on the form of the indictment, senior counsel for the appellant relied on the decision in Andrews v The Queen (1968) 126 CLR 198, in particular the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “To make out the counts of the indictment, it was necessary to establish that the applicant received the monies upon terms requiring him to account to Payne or to him and his wife as the case may be. It then had to be established that at a time when he was bound to account according to those terms he fraudulently omitted to do so. Because of the precise concepts involved in this particular statutory offence great care is called for … to ensure that the ingredients of the offence are lucidly and accurately explained to the jury.” (at 205) 
         
        
       
     25 This passage, so it was submitted, mandates the naming in the indictment of the person or persons to whom the money in question is to be paid in order that the technical requirements of the section are met. I do not agree. While it stresses the technical nature of the offence, the passage is merely relating those technical requirements to the particular facts of the case then before the Court. It does not, in my opinion, state that it is essential to the validity of the indictment that the person or persons to whom the money in question is to be paid must be named in the indictment. 
      
       
     26 Although the indictment did not name the three persons who were Mrs Ruello’s partners in the Stella Restaurant business, the concept of purchasing the restaurant necessarily entailed the payment of the purchase price for their shares to them. The appellant was aware of the essence of the matter alleged against him, namely, that he took Mrs Ruello’s money on the basis that he would use it to purchase the shares of the other partners in the restaurant business so that Mrs Ruello would become an owner with him of the restaurant but that he failed to do so and used the money for his own purposes. The indictment identified the essential factual ingredients of the offence and contained sufficient particularity to enable the appellant to be reasonably apprised of the charge that he faced. (Council of the City of Shoalhaven v State Pollution Control Commission (1991) 52 A Crim R 291 at 294) 
      
       
     27 The inclusion of the names of the three partners in the indictment was not a necessary ingredient of the charge under s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. Although it is highly desirable that the person (or persons) to whom the money the subject of a charge under that section is to be paid should be named, the actual name (or names) of such person (or persons) is in essence a particular rather than an averment essential to the validity of the indictment. 
      
       
     28 On behalf of the appellant it was further argued that the reason Mrs Ruello gave the amount of $27,800 to the appellant was for him to invest it and that that being the appellant’s failure to account was not a failure which fell within s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. In support of this argument reference was made to the following passage from Andrews v The Queen (supra); 
      
       
        
         
         “So far as the first count of the indictment was concerned ( 
         under s 178A  
         Payne expressly said that he made the amount stated in the charge available to the applicant by way of ‘investment’ for which he accepted a post-dated cheque.” (at 209) 
         
        
       
     29 However, in the present case the trial judge determined (correctly in my view) that the reason that Mrs Ruello gave the amounts totalling $27,800 to the appellant was in order to buy out the interest of the other three partners in the Stella restaurant by paying that money to them for the transfer of their shares to Mrs Ruello and the appellant. That is quite a different situation from that considered by the High Court in Andrews v The Queen (supra).  
      
       
     30 The effect of Andrews v The Queen (supra) is that on a charge of fraudulently omitting to account contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900 the Crown has merely to establish that the monies the subject of the charge were received by an accused on terms requiring such accused to account for them and that at the time when the accused was bound to account for such money in accordance with such terms he fraudulently omitted to do so. 
      
       
     31 In my opinion the trial judge correctly stated the necessary elements of the offence for which the appellant was tried. He found that the reason Mrs Ruello gave her money to the appellant was so that the restaurant could be purchased (J5) Pending the purchase of the restaurant the monies were to be placed in the ANZ bank account which had been opened in Mrs Ruello’s name at the insistence of the appellant. The monies in question were not, however, placed in that account by the appellant, nor were they used for the purchase of the restaurant, nor returned to Mrs Ruello. The judge specifically held that: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am … satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused received the money from Mrs Ruello specially for the purpose of investing it for the acquisition of the restaurant Stella. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not invest the money”  
         
        
        
       in such manner and that 
        
        
         
         “I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he fraudulently misappropriated the money for his own use.” (J 8) 
         
        
       
     32 It was further contended on behalf of the appellant that the form of the indictment was such that the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 could not, as a matter of law, be applied in the instant case. In this regard he relied, inter alia, on the decisions of the High Court in Wilde v Regina (1998) 164 CLR 365 at 371-372 per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ and of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Giri [2001] NSWCCA 197, unreported 12 June 2001).  
      
       
     33 As I have already said, in my opinion, the elements of the offence for which the appellant was tried were correctly stated and there was ample evidence to support the findings of the trial judge that such offence had been made out. Had the matter now before the court been raised during the trial the indictment could have been amended. It was not so raised and the indictment was not amended. Even if the names of the persons to whom the monies in question were to be paid were not included in the indictment and even if this, contrary to the conclusion to which I have come, may have constituted a technical defect in the indictment, the appellant was well apprised of the nature of the charge against him, was content to proceed on the basis of the indictment that that had already been considered in a previous trial and by the Court of Criminal Appeal and there was ample evidence to substantiate the offence under s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900 to which the appellant understood he was answering. (Cheng v The Queen (2000) 208 CLR 248 at 284) Accordingly, the case is one in which it would, in my opinion, be appropriate to apply the proviso of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and I would do so were it necessary to do so. Cases such as McQueeney (1989) 39 A Crim R 58 and Spies (2000) 113 A Crim R 448 which were referred to by counsel for the appellant are not to the contrary of such a conclusion. However, for the reasons that I have already indicated it is not necessary to do so. 
      
       
     34 For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that whilst the appellant should be permitted to rely upon the additional grounds of appeal referred to in the notice of motion of 5 March 2002, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     35 BUDDIN J: I agree with O’Keefe J. 
      
       
     36 Appeal dismissed.

     3 HOWIE J: The appellant was convicted after trial by jury of a number of counts of, what may be termed, child sexual assault offences. He was sentenced by her Honour Judge Latham to an aggregate sentence of ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. The appellant appeals against his conviction on a single ground of appeal being: 
      
       
        
         
          
         The trial judge erred in the directions given to the jury regarding delay in complaint. 
         
        
       
     4 The indictment upon which the appellant was arraigned before the jury contained nine counts as follows; 
      
       
        
         
         1. Between 10 November 1992 and 30 April 1993 at Burraga in the State of New South Wales did assault [the complainant] and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on [the complainant] being under the age of 16, namely 11 years old. 
          
          
         2. Between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1993 at Ambarvale in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] a child then between the age of ten years and 16 years, namely 12 years old. 
          
          
         3. Between 1 October 1994 and 31 April 1995 at Eaglevale in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant] knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the age of 16 years old, namely 13 years old. 
          
          
         4. Between 30 November 1998 and 31 April 1999 at Kearns in the state of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
          
          
         5. On 4 December 1998 at Casula in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
          
          
         6. On 4 December 1998 at Casula in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
          
          
         7. On 4 December 1998 at Casula in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
          
          
         8. On 3 February 2000 at Varroville in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
          
          
         9. On 7 February 2000 at Kearns in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence [the complainant] was under the authority of [SJF]. 
         
        
       
     5 The complainant in each count was the appellant's stepdaughter who was aged 11 years when the first offence was allegedly committed and 18 years at the date of the last alleged offence. The complainant first raised the allegations giving rise to the charges on 8 February 2000 to her boyfriend's mother and then made a formal complaint to the police on 10 February 2000. There was, thus, a delay in complaint of almost seven years in respect of the first count and one day in respect of the last count. The appellant was arrested soon after the complaint was made to police. The trial commenced on 13 June 2001. 
      
       
     6 The first count related to an occasion when the appellant took the complainant, his son and other friends on a camping weekend near Jenolan Caves. They stayed in a caravan in the bushland. The complainant alleged that, while she was in the bed in which the appellant, her brother and she slept, the appellant cuddled her and touched her on the breasts. He then put his hands under her pants and touched her on the vagina beneath her clothing. The complainant said she tried to move away from the appellant but he held her there by force. The complainant said she made no complaint about this conduct because she was scared of the appellant. The complainant and her mother asserted that at this time the complainant’s breasts were developed. 
      
       
     7 The second count arose when the complainant was in Year 6 at high school. At that time she would work on Saturdays with the appellant in his butcher shop at Ambarvale. The complainant alleged that on one occasion the appellant took her into the back room of the shop and, while she was lying on an old wooden table, took her clothes off and placed his penis in her vagina. This occurred shortly after the shop closed at 3 pm. The complainant said she was crying and told the appellant to stop because he was hurting her. The appellant then removed his penis from the complainant's vagina and ejaculated into a cup. During her evidence the complainant indicated from photographs that there had been a number of changes made to the shop since the date of the offence and that at the relevant time it was impossible to see into the back room from outside the shop. A witness was called by the Crown to give evidence as to the layout of the shop at that time. 
      
       
     8 The third count related to a time when the complainant was in Year 7 at high school and was living in Gould Road Eaglevale. The complainant was waiting in her mother's motor vehicle in front of the garage of their home. She turned on the ignition in order to listen to the radio but turned the key too far and started the motor. The vehicle lurched forward into the closed garage door damaging it. The complainant's mother telephoned the appellant and requested that he return home from work. When the appellant arrived home, he moved the vehicle out of the garage and the complainant's mother went to work, leaving the appellant to take the complainant to school. However, the complainant did not go to school and later that day in the garage, the appellant had penile vaginal intercourse with her. 
      
       
     9 Count 4 related to an occasion when the complainant was aged 17 and the family was living in Epping Forest Drive Kearns. The complainant's mother had gone to visit a friend whose daughter had recently given birth to a baby. The complainant was sitting on the lounge at the back of the house when the appellant had intercourse with her by placing his penis in her vagina. While this was happening, the complainant heard the sound of keys rattling in the screen door. She jumped up, grabbed her jeans and ran to an area near the pool table. By that stage the complainant's mother and her brother had walked into the room. The complainant was wearing only a shirt and no underwear. Her mother asked her what she was doing and the appellant responded that she was looking for her swimming costume. 
      
       
     10 Counts 5, 6 and 7 all arose from the one incident and related to a period when the complainant had left school and was working full-time with the appellant in his butcher shop at Moorebank. She was then aged 17 years. The complainant said that, after they finished work on 4 December 1998, she and the appellant travelled to the Jolly Knight Motel near Liverpool. She believed she was going to a Christmas party, to which she and the appellant had been invited by friends in the army. When they arrived at the hotel, the appellant told the complainant to remain in the vehicle while he went to the reception area. The appellant returned a short time later and the complainant accompanied him to a motel room. The appellant placed his hands on the complainant's breasts then put her hand on his penis saying, ""This is why we’re here"". The complainant and the appellant showered together and, while doing so, the appellant placed his penis in her mouth (Count 5). The appellant then told the complainant to get out of the shower, dry herself and get into bed. She did so and lay on her back. The appellant placed his fingers in her vagina (Count 6). The appellant then moved the complainant so that she was on her elbows and knees and placed his penis in her vagina. He then moved her onto her back and again placed his penis in her vagina (Count 7). At about 9:30pm the complainant and the appellant left the motel and went to a hotel for dinner. They arrived home at about 10:30pm. The complainant's mother asked where they had been and the appellant told her that they had gone to the army Christmas party. 
      
       
     11 Count 8 related to an incident on 3 February 2000. On that morning the complainant and the appellant were travelling to the butcher shop in a new Holden Senator. The appellant parked near some bushes at Varroville in a quiet area with few homes. This was about 5:40am and still dark. The appellant reclined the complainant's seat and then had sexual intercourse with her by placing his penis in her vagina. While this was occurring, the complainant saw two men walk past, one of whom was walking a dog. 
      
       
     12 Count 9 related to an incident on 7 February 2000 when the complainant's mother had gone bowling and her younger brother had retired to bed. The appellant told the complainant to go to his bedroom and she complied because she was scared of him. The appellant came to the room, shut the door and told the complainant to lie on the floor. He placed his penis in her vagina and then into her mouth. The next day the complainant left home. 
      
       
     13 There was evidence of sexual acts committed by the appellant upon the complainant that were not charged by the Crown but admitted as relationship evidence. These included an allegation that the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant on a Mickey Mouse rug in the complainant’s room when she was aged 14. After his arrest, the appellant’s semen was located on a Mickey Mouse rug. 
      
       
     14 Although the Crown case relied almost exclusively upon the evidence of the complainant, there was some evidence that the jury could have found supported her allegations. This included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 4: Evidence of the complainant’s mother that she had seen the complainant standing near the pool table holding her jeans. She was naked from the waist down. The appellant said that the complainant was getting her bikini. 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 5,6,and 7: The complainant’s mother gave evidence that the appellant had told her not to worry about going to the army party and that he would take the complainant straight from work. He said that they would not stay long. They arrived home about 11.30pm. An invoice from the Jolly Knight Hotel showed that on that date the appellant had booked a room for two adults. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 8: Dennis Grenfell gave evidence that in January or February 2000 at about 5.45am he was walking his dog when he saw a dark coloured Holden Commodore parked in trees. The description of the vehicle was similar to that owned by the appellant at the time. Bernard Marvin gave evidence that in late January 2000 he saw a family-sized sedan parked on the side of the road at about 5.45am. He also noticed another walker with a dog. 
         
        
       
     15 There was also evidence of a general nature that the jury could find was consistent with the complainant’s evidence. The complainant was examined by a medical practitioner on 10 February 2000. The state of the complainant’s vagina was consistent with long-term frequent vaginal intercourse. The complainant’s boy friend gave evidence that he and the complainant had sexual intercourse only once. The appellant wrote a letter to the complainant after she left home, apologising and containing the statement, “All I can say is I’m jealous of anyone that looks at you.”16 There was a significant area of contention between the appellant and the complainant’s mother about the circumstances surrounding the alleged offences. For example, she disputed the appellant’s claim that he had taken their son with him on the evening of the army party. She also denied that there was as much damage to the garage door as the appellant maintained there was. 
      
       
     17 The appellant gave evidence denying the allegations. In particular he made the following responses to the particular counts in the indictment: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: Although he slept in the same bed with the complainant and her brother, he did not touch her breasts or vagina. The complainant was not developed in her breasts at this time. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2: He never had sexual intercourse in the butcher shop. He closed it at 12pm. There were a number of large mirrors in the shop that allowed him to see if customers were in the shop when he was in the backroom and, thus, would allow persons entering the shop to see into the backroom. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 3: Although there was an occasion when the door of the garage was damaged and he returned home from work, he did not sexually assault the complainant. There was too much damage to the garage door to allow him to repair it and commit the offence. He kept the complainant at home to move objects stored in the garage so that he could repair the door. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 4: He recalled lying on the lounge in the poolroom and was aware of his wife returning home. He heard her speaking with the complainant but did not know what was said. He denied having intercourse with the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 5, 6 and 7: He denied having intercourse with the complainant at the Jolly Knight Motel. He went to the hotel with the complainant and his son after a dispute with his wife. Although he intended to stay there the night, he later changed his mind and returned home with the children. He denied that there was an army Christmas party on that date. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 8: He had never been to Varroville in the Holden Senator. It was physically impossible for him to have intercourse in the vehicle because of his size. 
         
        
       ' 
        
         
         Count 9: He denied having intercourse with the complainant on the floor of his bedroom. If his wife went bowling, he went to bed early. 
         
        
       
     18 The appellant denied that he had ever had intercourse on the Mickey Mouse rug and explained that his semen must have been placed there when he wrapped the rug around himself and his wife when they slept on a futon. 
      
       
     19 The trial judge gave the jury full and entirely appropriate directions on the onus and standard of proof. In the course of her Honour’s summing-up, when she was discussing the jury's approach to the assessment of witnesses, her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Let me just pass from honesty to the question of accuracy for a minute. Even if you were to accept [the complainant] and her mother as witnesses of truth there is also the question of their accuracy, particularly [the complainant's] accuracy, because some of these alleged offences occurred over a period of years and some of them may not have assumed any significance for [the complainant's mother] at the particular time. In addition, for part of the period of time covered by the indictment the complainant was a child between the ages of eleven and thirteen years. So you must take into account the fact that her capacity to recollect accurately every detail of her routine domestic life might be affected by that passage of time. The passage of time between the events of 1990 to [the complainant's] statements to the police and her evidence in court you might think would affect her ability, and her mother's ability, to accurately recall events and the sequence of those events. 
         
        
        
         
         Of course some events have such a profound impact on a person that the passage of time does little to affect the memory. For example, the death of a loved one or a serious accident in the family, both the event itself and the surrounding circumstances are fixed in the memory because of the importance of that event in the person's life. As I said, they are all matters for you. I am merely illustrating the range of factors which might affect a witness’s accuracy and of course the accused also has that difficulty in that he is being asked to recall accurately, events that occurred sometime ago which assumed no significance at the time that those events were occurring. You will appreciate of course that a witness can be a completely honest witness, albeit mistaken in their recollection of events.” 
         
        
       
     20 Later in the summing up the trial judge gave the following directions in respect of the evidence of the complainant: 
      
       
        
         
         “In this case there is one witness who is essential to proof of each of the nine charges in the indictment, and that is [the complainant]. You should therefore exercise caution before you were to convict the accused on the evidence of that one witness. You should only find the accused guilty if you are satisfied of the truth of the evidence of that witness. The fact that I have given you that direction does not mean that I have formed any view at all as to the honesty or the reliability of [the complainant], it is a direction which is given in every case where the Crown depends upon the evidence of one witness. When I say she is essential to proof of the Crown case I say that because there has never been any issue in this trial that there was no one in a position to give evidence of this sexual activity other than [the complainant] and as you are no doubt aware, sexual activity invariably takes place in private and invariably there are only two people there, and in this trial [the complainant] says that she had sexual intercourse on a number of occasions with the accused and the accused simply says it did not happen. 
         
        
       
     21 Having directed the jury on the ingredients of each of the offences as set out in the indictment and the evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove those ingredients, her Honour gave the jury directions as to how they were to use the failure of the complainant to raise the allegations before 8 February 2000 in their assessment of her credibility. The trial judge then went on to direct the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is another aspect which flows from the complainant's delay in making a complaint and I’m required to give you this direction. It is important that you understand and that you appreciate fully the effect which this delay has had upon the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing the prosecution case or by adducing evidence in his own case which might establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, I just want to refer you to some specific difficulties encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or in adducing evidence in his case and these delays arise as a result of the fact that in relation to counts one to seven of the indictment, the complainant said nothing to anyone until 9 or 10 February in the year 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         Firstly, in relation to count two, count two is the allegation of sexual intercourse in the Ambarvale butcher shop. Because the shop has been altered since the period of time when the accused operated that business, the accused has lost the opportunity to present photographic evidence of the position of the wall mirrors and the layout of the shop and he has lost the opportunity to demonstrate the area which might be reflected by those mirrors from a position outside the shop. 
         
        
        
         
         You will recall that the accused’s contention is that a person standing outside the shop after closing could, if they wished to stand in the right position outside the shop, see into the majority of the back area of the shop by virtue of the reflection from what he said were wall mirrors on the left-hand side and that in those circumstances he said it would be incredible that he would take such a risk, so he has lost the opportunity to present that evidence to you in a more concrete form. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to count three, he has lost the opportunity to present photographic evidence of the extent of damage to the garage door because the garage door has been fixed in the meantime and similarly he has lost the opportunity to convey perhaps by photographic evidence the extent of the equipment which was stored in that garage and, therefore, to support the evidence that he gave in relation to the extent of the damage and the type of repairs that he was required to do in order to secure the garage door. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to counts one and four, count one being the camping at Burraga and count four being the lounge room incident, the accused does not dispute that there was an occasion when he took [the complainant] and Shane camping at Burraga and he does not dispute that there was an occasion when [the complainant] was seen by her mother in the backroom of the house naked from the waist down, but the passage of time since those events makes it difficult for him to accurately recall them and leaves him in the position where he can do no more than simply deny that there was any sexual activity on those occasions. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to counts five, six and seven which occurred at the Jolly Knight Hotel, the accused says in relation to that that he was there on that night with Shane and [the complainant], that is, on 4 December 1998 according to the Jolly Knight Motel booking slip, Exhibit N. He is not in a position, come February of the year 2000, to produce any witnesses who may have seen either himself and/or [the complainant] and/or Shane in the restaurant or when they went go-karting, so he has lost the opportunity to call evidence from other persons who may have seen them on that occasion. 
         
        
       
     22 There was no complaint by counsel for the appellant at the trial about these directions nor any request for any further directions on the topic of the delay or its effect upon the ability of the appellant to test the Crown case or defend himself. This was notwithstanding that at the conclusion of the summing up defence counsel raised a large number of factual and legal matters that he wished the trial judge to correct, amplify or add to what her Honour had already said. Her Honour recalled the jury and continued her summing up in compliance with some of defence counsel’s requests. This included a direction as to a suggested motive put forward by the appellant to explain why the complainant might have fabricated her allegations. The summing up concluded with the trial judge reminding the jury that it was not a question of choosing between the respective cases of the Crown and the accused, but that they had to ask themselves whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had proved the charges in the indictment.23 On the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant, Mr Odgers SC, conceded that there was no error or deficiency in the directions given by her Honour as to the prejudice suffered by the appellant. They were both of a general and specific nature. Her Honour told the jury the delay had affected the reliability of the complainant and her mother as to their accounts of events and the sequence of events. She emphasised to the jury the importance of appreciating the effect of delay on the ability of the appellant to defend himself both in testing the prosecution case and in adducing evidence in his own case that might establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. Her Honour gave concrete instances relating to the particular counts in the indictment of prejudice suffered by the appellant. It was not suggested at the trial or on appeal that these directions were other than appropriate.24 But Mr Odgers argued that the directions were defective in that the trial judge did not explain to the jury how they should give effect to the prejudice suffered by the appellant in the course of their deliberations. He submitted that the trial judge had not warned the jury effectively that, because of the delay, it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on counts one to seven. At the very least, so he submitted, her Honour ought to have told the jury that, as a result of the prejudice suffered by the appellant, they must scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with care before convicting upon it in relation to the first seven counts on the indictment. He submitted that, without such a warning, the jury might not have appreciated the full impact of the prejudice suffered by the appellant on their assessment of the Crown case notwithstanding her Honour’s earlier directions and warnings in relation to their approach to the complainant’s evidence.25 In particular, counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 474, where his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by the delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
          
          
         (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that the jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
          
          
         (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
          
          
         (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
          
          
         (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross-examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused has not been responsible, had created those difficulties. 
          
          
         (vi) Where the summing up identifies difficulties pursuant to (v), the trial judge should indicate to the jury how they should approach their task of determining whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no universally applicable formula but some reference to the additional care or caution with which they should approach the prosecution evidence is usually appropriate. 
          
          
         (vii) In some cases the warning which uses such terminology as ""dangerous"" or ""unsafe"" to convict will be required. The reason for the warning must be explained, generally by relating the danger to the specific difficulties of the character referred to in (v)"". 
          
         
        
       The submission is that her Honour failed to comply with proposition (vi) above. 
        
       
     26 It is unnecessary for the determination of the present appeal to consider in detail the, now numerous, decisions of this Court and the High Court dealing with the appropriate warning, directions and comments to be given in a case where there is long delay between the commission of an alleged sexual assault offence and the trial of the accused for that offence. These decisions were recently critically examined and the principles re-stated in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60. The effect upon a conviction of the absence of an adequate warning was discussed in R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210. 
      
       
     27 The extent of the warning required and the consequence of a failure to give an adequate warning will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case and a consideration of the summing up as a whole. A trial judge will fall into appealable error only where the summing up is so inadequate that it fails to perform its function to ensure that the particular trial was fair and according to law. Where it is asserted that the summing up is inadequate by reason of some failure to direct or warn the jury appropriately, the question for this Court to determine is whether a substantial miscarriage of justice might have occurred, particularly where, as here, no request was made for any further direction. The ultimate question is whether the failure of the trial judge to give an adequate and appropriate warning resulted in a trial that was relevantly unfair, that is one in which the appellant lost a chance of an acquittal by reason of that failure: R v GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493 at [111]; R v WRC at [119]. If the trial is unfair in this way, then the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act cannot be applied, because a conviction would not be inevitable. This is so whether or not counsel at the trial requested a direction of the kind that should have been given: R v GPP at [60]; R v WRC at [121], [153]. 
      
       
     28 In my view the ground of appeal is not made out. True it is that, having identified the particular prejudice suffered by the appellant in respect of each of counts one to seven, her Honour did not tell the jury that, by reason of such prejudice, they should scrutinise the complainant's evidence with care or that for this reason it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of the complainant alone in respect of those counts. But I find it impossible to believe that the jury failed to appreciate that this was the significance of her Honour’s extensive and detailed references to the prejudice suffered by the appellant, having regard to what had been said by her Honour earlier in relation to the onus and standard of proof and the approach to be taken to the complainant’s evidence as the sole basis of the Crown’s case. There was no other possible use the jury could have made of her Honour's analysis of the prejudice to the appellant in defending each of counts one to seven except by taking it into account when assessing the complainant’s evidence in determining whether the Crown had proved its case. In any event, after referring to the prejudice suffered by the appellant, her Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “So in summary, then, you could only convict the accused if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth and the reliability of the complainant's evidence with respect to the nine charges in the indictment and only after taking into account the fact that the passage of time since some of those events, and in particular, as I said, counts one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven, has directly affected the ability of some of the Crown witnesses and of the accused to accurately recall the chronology and the surrounding circumstances of those events. 
         
        
       
     29 I have already adverted to the fact that earlier in the summing up her Honour told the jury that, because the Crown case relied almost exclusively upon the evidence of the complainant to prove each of the charges, the jury would have to exercise caution before convicting upon the complainant’s evidence. I acknowledge that such a warning, taken by itself, would have been insufficient to address the facts of the present case. There is a difference between a warning based upon the fact that the Crown case relies upon a single witness and a warning based upon the effect of delay upon the accused’s ability to defend himself or herself: R v Roddom [2001] NSWCCA 168. But the warning given by the trial judge cannot be disregarded when considering what the jury would have understood to be their approach to the complainant’s evidence from the whole of the summing up. The trial judge said nothing to diminish the weight of that warning during the course of the summing up, cf R v Roddom, above. Quite the contrary, by her extensive discussion of the effects of delay on both the Crown and defence case, the jury would have understood that this was a further reason to exercise caution before accepting the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt.30 Although in most cases of delay it will be essential to warn the jury that it would be dangerous to convict, I am not persuaded that such a warning was required in the present case in order to ensure a fair trial to the accused. In the evidence before her Honour there was neither the extensive delay or the concatenation of factors which has been present in cases where the expression “dangerous to convict” has been required, see R v SJB [2002] NSWCCA 163 at [52] (a case in which the desirability of such a warning was apparent to defence counsel who requested one). Although there was a delay in respect of the first seven counts, there was none in respect of the last two counts. Whether a warning is required is not a matter of mathematical calculation, but the extent of the delay and the consequential prejudice are clearly relevant matters. The fifth, sixth and seventh counts occurred a little more than twelve months before the complaint and there could have been little actual prejudice, if any, suffered by the appellant. 
      
       
     31 In my view, reading the summing up as a whole and in the context of the issues raised, the jury was sufficiently warned about the approach they were to take to the evidence of the complainant, both by reason of the importance of her evidence to the Crown case and because of the prejudice to the accused caused by the delay, to ensure that the accused received a fair trial. A judicial caution was given in relation to reliance upon the evidence of the complainant, appropriate comments were made as to the effect of delay upon the reliability of the complainant and other Crown witnesses, and the jury were told in sufficiently clear terms of the potential and actual prejudice suffered by the appellant because of the delay in complaint. The summary quoted above would have been unexceptional had her Honour referred to the necessity to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with care. I cannot accept that the requirement for an appropriate summing up to meet the circumstances of a particular case has descended to such formalism that the failure to use particular words or the expression “dangerous to convict” amounts to an error of law in every case of delay. 
      
       
     32 I acknowledge that, had she been asked to do so, it would have been open to her Honour to have formulated a further warning based upon the extra caution needed in convicting on the first seven counts because of the delay over and above the fact that the Crown case was based upon the evidence of a single witness. But no such warning was requested, notwithstanding that the decision of the High Court in Crampton v R (2000) 176 ALR 369 had been given in November the preceding year. Counsel for the appellant at trial may have thought that such a distinction between the approaches to be taken to the complainant’s evidence in respect of the different counts on the indictment would not have been helpful to his client. But in any event, the fact that counsel did not believe it necessary to ask for any further warning or comment from her Honour on the issue of prejudice to the appellant confirms my view that, taken as a whole, the summing up was adequate to ensure that the jury understood the manner in which they were to approach the evidence of the complainant and that the trial of the appellant had been fair. 
      
       
     33 In my view the failure of the trial judge to specifically direct the jury to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with care or to caution them that it would be dangerous to convict on the first seven counts did not result in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice having regard to what her Honour did in fact tell the jury and the evidence before them. I am not persuaded that her Honour did fall into error in the summing up. But even if it were necessary to consider whether to apply the proviso to s 6, I would unhesitatingly do so. I am satisfied that the appellant did not lose a chance of acquittal by the failure of her Honour to direct precisely in terms of the warning in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 in this particular case. In any event rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies and I am far from persuaded that there might have been a miscarriage of justice in the present case. 
      
       
     34 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. Although the appellant indicated on his Notice of Appeal that he was seeking to appeal against sentence, no argument was advanced either in writing or orally in support of such an application. Nor could there be. The application for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 THE COURT: On Monday 22 July 2002 the Court made orders allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction and entering a verdict of acquittal.  
      
       
     2 The appellant appealed against his conviction of the offence of armed robbery. He was indicted for that on 13 August 1999 at Gorokan he did rob Brian Van Stappen of his wallet, whilst being armed with an offensive implement, namely, a screwdriver: s97(1) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 20 years). Upon the jury’s finding of guilt in the District Court at Gosford on 9 August 2001, her Honour Judge English sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 2 years and 10 months fixing a non-parole period of 12 months. The sentence was ordered to be served by way of periodic detention. On 6 February 2002 the appellant was granted bail by the Supreme Court pending the hearing of his appeal. 
      
       
     3 At the outset it is to be noted, from her Honour’s remarks on sentence, that the appellant had previously stood for trial in March 2001 on two counts arising from the same events: the first was of entering the Gorokan High School with intent to commit a felony; the second was the present armed robbery count. At his first trial the appellant was found not guilty of the first count and the jury failed to agree on the second.  
      
       
     4 One ground of appeal was notified: that the verdict of the jury was not reasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, that ground being founded in the decision of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494. 
      
       
     5 The issue in the trial was the identification of the offender. Two witnesses, Mrs O’Connor and Mr Van Stappen (and it is to be noted that the latter only was said to be the victim of any criminal offence by the appellant) each gave evidence of the ocurrence and a description of the offender. Each chose the appellant from a line up.  
      
       
     6 Sandra O’Connor said that she was walking down a hallway near the school’s keytell room when she heard a scream. The offender ran past her, stopped and came back to her. He was at arm’s length from her and said: “Where’s your money?” He had a black beanie over his head, which was pulled right down. When the offender spoke to her, he was trying to pull the beanie up and keep it over his face. She saw “this part of his face”, and indicated from above the eyebrows to the chin. He was looking straight at her at the time and was holding a screwdriver in his hand, which was raised above his head. He again asked her if she had any money and she said: “There’s no money here. There’s no money here”. Van Stappen, who had come upon the scene, threw his wallet on the floor. The offender picked it up and ran out.  
      
       
     7 She described the offender as wearing a black jacket, black tracksuit pants, black sports shoes and a backpack. He was about 18 to 20 years old. He had a “thinnish” build. He had a “whitish face” and was clean-shaven. O’Connor estimated that the offender was about 5 foot 4 inches to 5 foot 6 inches tall. She said that when he was standing up, his face, which she would never forget, was right opposite hers. Her Honour estimated Mrs O’Connor’s height at about 5 foot 4 inches. 
      
       
     8 The appellant was arrested on 19 August 1999. On that day, O’Connor attended The Entrance police station where she took part in an identification parade of 14 young males including the appellant whom she “identified”. She told the police: “Number 2 but the hair’s thrown me”. She said that she did not see any of the offender’s hair on 13 August. She admitted that when she went to the police station on 19 August she expected that the offender would be in the line up. She admitted that after the line up Inspector Rice had asked her: “Where have you seen this person?” O’Connor replied: “I think at Gorokan high school. The face is very familiar, but the long hair’s got me”. 
      
       
     9 Brian Van Stappen gave evidence that whilst he was unlocking the cleaner’s cupboard, the offender jumped out screaming and ran down to the end of the hallway. O’Connor was in the hallway between him and the offender. Van Stappen saw the offender holding a long bladed screwdriver in his hand. He was holding the screwdriver at a 90-degree angle and said: “Give us your money”. When the offender said that, he pulled his beanie down over his face and held the screwdriver up to his ear. Van Stappen then threw his wallet on the floor. He was about 12 feet away from the offender. The offender then “turned his threats” towards O’Connor and said: “Give us your money”. O’Connor then broke down and was screaming “I haven’t got any money”. Van Stappen said to the offender: “We got no more money. Take this wallet. Go. Leave us alone”. The offender then ran past him and straight out the front of the premises. About 15-20 seconds after Van Stappen threw his wallet on the floor, the offender turned left, then left again past where the library block was. He and O’Connor followed the offender out of the building. Van Stappen described the robbery as “life threatening”. Van Stappen did not see the offender’s face until he and the offender were in the hall. He described the beanie as a “fairly lengthy one”. It was rolled up on the sides and he could see it curled up on the offender’s head. It covered most of the offender’s hair, but Van Stappen saw some hanging down underneath the beanie. He described the offender’s hair colour as “dirty blonde”. Van Stappen said that the offender pulled his beanie down to his chin so that it covered his face for about one second, but then the offender pushed the beanie up from the bottom and pulled it over his face so Van Stappen could see his face again. The beanie did not fall down again after he pushed it up. Van Stappen estimated the offender to be at least 5 feet 11 inches tall. He was wearing a black sloppy joe, which had white writing on it with an emblem like a shield, black tracksuit pants and black shoes. Van Stappen conceded that when he gave his statement to police on 13 August 1999 and that when he gave evidence about this case on a previous occasion, he made no mention of the offender wearing a sloppy joe. On a previous occasion, he had said that the offender was wearing a “matching tracksuit”. Van Stappen said that he had observed the offender in the school block for a total of about 30 seconds. He described the lighting as being “as good as what I can see you here now”. Van Stappen gave evidence of the keys that were kept in the Keytell room and said that the locker that held those keys had been sprung open. On 19 August 1999, Van Stappen selected the appellant in an identification parade of 14 young men at The Entrance police station. He picked out “number 2”. He was asked: “Where have you seen that person before?” he said: “I have seen that person at Gorokan High”. At the line up, Van Stappen saw that the appellant had a couple of pimples. He had not told the police previously that the offender had pimples. 
      
       
     10 Other evidence called in the Crown case included that of Mr George Horvath who operated an Ampol service station close to the high school. He said that he saw a young man enter his service station at about 2.30am on the morning of the robbery. He had seen the young man in his store on many occasions. He knew his mother’s name as “Marilyn”. (The appellant admitted that he went to the service station that morning.) The witness had a brief chat to the appellant who left the service station and walked along Googaburra Road towards the Gorokan high school. He described the appellant as wearing a black beanie, a black lycra or nylon top and dark tracksuit pants. The beanie was a short one. He could see the appellant’s hair at the back of the beanie. It was long blonde hair. 
      
       
     11 The appellant’s mother, Marilyn Grieve, gave evidence that in August 1999, her son, the appellant, did not live with her, but came to sleep over at her house about three or four nights a week. Shortly before the police arrested the appellant on 19 August 1999, Mrs Grieve heard a rustling noise in her house at about 2.00am – 3.00am. The next morning (which was 18 August), as soon as she woke up, she saw a plastic bag which was not normally in the spare room. The bag contained about 40 keys and coloured tags, which were labelled “toilets” “storeroom” etc. These were clearly the keys from the Gorokan high school. Mrs Grieve put the keys underneath her clothes. When Mrs Grieve came home from work that day, she and the appellant had an argument about his failure to do the housework. She told the appellant he could find somewhere else to live and put his clothes outside the door. The appellant left the house and returned before dark and said: “Give me the bag”. She said: “What bag?” He said: “The bag”. She said: “I’ve got something on you” or “I’ve got something against you, David”. After that conversation, she left the house with her other son, Cole. When she returned the next morning, the keys and the bag had gone. 
      
       
     12 The inadequacies of the identification evidence were expounded as follows in the submissions for the appellant. The description of the offender given by O’Connor and Van Stappen more closely fitted another person, Daniel Bennett, than the appellant. In relation to height, O’Connor estimated that the offender was about 5 foot 4 to 5 foot 6 inches. She said that his face was right opposite her face. Her Honour estimated that Ms O’Connor was about 5 foot 4 inches. Van Stappen estimated that the offender was at least 5 foot 11 inches. Detective McIlveen, the officer in charge of the case, estimated the appellant to be about 6 foot 3 inches. The photograph tendered of Bennett (exhibit M) describes Bennett as being 185cm tall (which is a little less than 6 foot 1 inch). The appellant described himself as being a bit taller than Bennett. Bennett’s height is closer to the estimate given by both eyewitnesses. 
      
       
     13 Of even greater significance is the evidence about hair length. O’Connor told the police that when she picked the appellant out in the identification parade, she said: “Number 2 but the hair’s thrown me”. She also told Inspector Rice that “the long hair’s got me”. She said that she did not see any of the offender’s hair during the robbery. It is clear, so it was submitted, that O’Connor believed that the offender’s hair was different to the appellant’s hair. The appellant was a student of the school and it is possible that when she said to Rice “the face is very familiar” she recognised the appellant from seeing him in or around school. 
      
       
     14 Van Stappen said he could see some hair hanging out underneath the offender’s beanie, but the beanie covered the majority of the offender’s hair. Van Stappen had greater opportunity to see the offender’s hair because he saw the offender pulling his beanie up and down over his face. He does not describe the offender as having long or shoulder length hair. The initial police description of the offender is someone with “short, blonde hair”. There is no doubt that the appellant did not fit the police description of the offender as someone having short, blonde hair. He had shoulder length hair. McIlveen, Horvath and the appellant all confirm that fact. Horvath stated that when he saw the appellant that morning at the service station, the appellant’s hair was clearly visible when he wore his beanie. By contrast, Bennett had short hair. Smith (see below), a friend of Bennett’s said that Bennett’s appearance was the same in August 1999 as it was when the photograph was taken on 20 October 1999. He said that Bennett always had either short or shaven hair. The appellant said that Bennett had more hair than was shown on exhibit M. McIlveen knew Bennett was a person who had short or shaven hair. 
      
       
     15 Apart from the differences in height and hair colour, the appellant and Bennett were of similar appearance, which is a likely explanation for the eyewitnesses having selected the appellant in the identification parades. Bennett was born on 8 January 1981 (aged 18 years and 8 months at the time of the offence). The appellant was born on 6 December 1980. Both the appellant and Bennett had slim builds. The appellant’s evidence about the physical similarities between himself and Bennett was uncontradicted: 
      
       
        
         
         “ Well, everyone used to reckon that we were good, close enough, look alike to be brothers and that, like, I had long hair. He had short hair. Both sort of the same build and that and around the same height. I was probably a bit taller than him”. 
         
        
       
     16 There was an inherent unfairness in the identification parade, it was submitted, because Bennett was not in the line up even though the police knew that Bennett was a suspect as a result of information passed on to the police by Horvath. Detective McIlveen could not explain why the police did not attempt to locate Bennett so that he could be placed in the line up. It was submitted that the absence of Bennett in the line up casts doubt on the cogency of the Crown case. Furthermore, the circumstances in which O’Connor and Van Stappen observed the intruder contributed to the unreliability of any subsequent identification at a line up. The offence occurred in the early hours of the morning. There was very limited time to observe the intruder. Van Stappen estimated that the total time he had the intruder under observation was about 30 seconds. That is a far more likely estimate than O’Connor’s time estimates. Both eyewitnesses were understandably terrified. O’Connor broke down and started screaming during the robbery. Van Stappen described it as life threatening. There were inconsistencies between the two eyewitnesses concerning the order in which they and the offender left the building. 
      
       
     17 There was a second component to the case of some importance. That was evidence pointing to the possibility of the involvement of that other person, Daniel Bennett, as the offender. The Crown called Dwayne Smith and Jarred Allen, aged 18 and 21 respectively, who were drinking beers at the Lakehaven library in the early hours of 13 August 1999. Smith said that sometime between 3.00am and 5.00am that morning, he heard someone yell “Security” and saw two people run from the recreation centre across to the library and jump over the fence of the Daycare centre. He only saw both men for a few seconds. There was not much light. Both men were wearing dark black pants, dark black shirts and dark black beanies. One of them was carrying a Nike bag. Smith yelled out “David”. He was asked if he recognised the two people. Smith said he did. He was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q: Who do you say the two people were? 
          
         A: I could see Daniel Bennett and I think I seen David. 
         
        
        
         
         Q: And when you say you think you saw David, you’re talking about the accused? 
          
         A: Yes”. 
         
        
        
       Smith said he saw the hair on the second man (the appellant), but not on Bennett. The reason he yelled  
       “David” 
        was because of that man’s hair. Smith knew that appellant as a student of Gorokan high school and knew Bennett through the appellant. 
        
       
     18 Allen said that he and Smith got to the library about 4.30am-5.00am. After about 30 to 45 minutes, he saw a man run from behind the back of the recreational centre along a track behind them. The man came to within 10 to 15 metres of he and Smith. As the man ran past, Smith jumped out and yelled: “Daniel”.  The man stopped for a second and said: “I can’t stop now. I’ve got police and security guards chasing”. He kept on running. Allen described the man as being of slim build, about six foot tall, wearing a black jacket, black pants and a black beanie. He was carrying a black backpack. Allen gave a statement to police on 29 August 1999. He said that he thought that the man who ran past him was Daniel Bennett. The Crown did not challenge the evidence of Smith or Allen. Both Smith and Allen went to the Ampol service station at about 5.10am and spoke to Horvath after they heard the police sirens. The police searched them both for weapons. Horvath recalls one of them telling him that he spoke to the man who robbed the school and said it was Daniel Bennett. Horvath passed that information on to the police. Horvath had heard of the name Daniel Bennett in the local area. 
      
       
     19 There was also fingerprint evidence that linked Daniel Bennett, but not the appellant, to the offence. Two fingerprints were taken. The first print (B1) was taken from the bottom of a window frame of the school’s administration office. The second was from a cashbox located in the welfare office of the school. Detective Newton, a fingerprint expert, said that when he compared the fingerprints of Bennett with the fingerprint on B1, “there were points of identification, but there wasn’t enough detail for Daniel Bennett to be excluded from that fingerprint.” He could exclude the appellant. In other words, the fingerprint in the school could be Bennett’s but could not be the appellant’s. 
      
       
     20 The accused gave evidence denying his involvement, admitting his presence at the Ampol petrol station, and asserting that the keys had been delivered to his mother’s house by Bennett. Michele Phillips was called to corroborate his evidence as to the keys. She also gave evidence as to what Bennett as a matter of custom wore.  
      
       
     21 At the close of the Crown case, trial defence counsel applied for a Prasad direction (Regina v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161); her Honour gave the jury such a direction but the trial proceeded. In the course of the trial no question arose as to why it was that Bennett was not called to give evidence (for the principles in relation to such a matter see Regina v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279). From the summing-up to the jury it is apparent that trial counsel for the appellant made a “Jones v Dunkel” submission in regard to that witness (who also was not placed in the line up) and the jury was directed thereon. 
      
       
     22 It can be further observed that rather than a Prasad direction being sought, it could have been open (though it is not necessary to decide here) for an application to have been made by trial counsel in accordance with the situation postulated by the appellant’s counsel in R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 76E-G, per Gleeson CJ as to the “withdrawal” of the identification evidence. 
      
       
     23 In the course of short oral submissions the Crown conceded that nothing in the defence case added anything to the Crown case on the issue of identification. 
      
       
     24 In summary, it can be seen that the Crown case was, to say the least, at its end and certainly by the end of the whole of the evidence, fragile in the area of identification and vulnerable, again to say the least, by reason of what we consider to be the cogent evidence of the possibility of the involvement of Bennett, not least of which was that of the fingerprint expert. In those circumstances the Court was of the view that the deficiencies in the identification evidence and the cogent evidence linking Bennett to the commission of the offence caused it to have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant in accordance with the approach identified in M v The Queen and thus make the orders referred to.

      070013/02 R v KIRSTAIN WILLIAM KATARZYNSKI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Howie J: The accused has been indicted for murder and is currently standing trial before a jury. The deceased was shot by the accused following a number of altercations between them in a hotel in Liverpool in the early hours of the morning of 6 April 2001. There is ample evidence before the jury that the accused was intoxicated as a result of his voluntary consumption of alcohol at the time of the shooting. There is no issue that the accused committed the act which caused the death of the deceased although, it will be a matter for the jury to determine whether the act causing death was voluntary and whether the accused at the time of firing the gun had the necessary mental state for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    2 The Crown has conceded that on the evidence led in the trial it is open for the jury to find that there was a real possibility that when the accused shot the deceased he was acting in his own self defence. The Crown has also conceded that the applicable law relevant to that issue is Part 11 Division 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), see R v Michael James Taylor [2002] NSWSC 610. 
     
      
    3 The relevant provisions of the Crimes Act are, therefore, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        418 Self-defence — when available 
         
        (1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence. 
         
        (2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary: 
         
          
          (a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
           
          (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or 
           
          (c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or 
           
          (d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, 
          
         
        and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them. 
         
         
        419 Self-defence — onus of proof 
         
        In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence. 
         
         
        420 Self-defence — not available if death inflicted to protect property or trespass to property 
         
        This Division does not apply if the person uses force that involves the intentional or reckless infliction of death only: 
         
          
          (a) to protect property, or 
           
          (b) to prevent criminal trespass or to remove a person committing criminal trespass. 
          
         
         
        421 Self-defence — excessive force that inflicts death 
         
        (1) This section applies if: 
         
          
          (a) the person uses force that involves the intentional or reckless infliction of death, and 
           
          (b) the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them, 
          
         
        but the person believes the conduct is necessary: 
         
          
          (c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or 
           
          (d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person. 
          
         
        (2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter. 
         
         
        422 Self-defence — response to lawful conduct 
         
        This Division is not excluded merely because: 
         
          
          (a) the conduct to which the person responds is lawful, or 
           
          (b) the other person carrying out the conduct to which the person responds is not criminally responsible for it. 
          
         
         
        423 Offences to which Division applies 
         
        (1) This Division applies to offences committed before or after the commencement of this Division, except as provided by this section. 
         
        (2) This Division does not apply to an offence if proceedings for the offence (other than committal proceedings) were instituted before the commencement of this Division. 
        
       
      
    4 The evidence in this trial would appear to give rise to a consideration by the jury of whether the accused was acting in self-defence under s 418(2); that is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he believed his conduct in firing the hand gun three times toward the deceased was necessary to defend himself and, whether such conduct was “a reasonable response in the circumstances as he [ ] perceived them”. Depending upon what decision the jury comes to on that issue, it may be open for it to find the accused guilty of manslaughter under the excessive force provision in s 421. 
     
      
    5 At the close of the Crown case I raised with counsel the interpretation of s 418(2) and in particular whether the accused’s intoxication was a relevant matter to a determination of the reasonableness of his response to what he perceived to be the threat to him presented by the deceased at the time that he fired the hand gun, a bullet from which passed through the deceased’s heart. To understand the point it is necessary to refer briefly to the most recent history of the law of self-defence in this State. 
     
      
    6 At common law, at least since Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) (1987) 162 CLR 645, the question to be asked by a jury when considering the issue of self-defence on a trial of murder was whether there was a real possibility that the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did when his act caused the death of the deceased. If the Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt either that the accused did not hold such a belief or that he had no reasonable grounds for such a belief, he was to be acquitted: Dziduch (1990) 47 A Crim R 378 at 379-380. It was the accused’s belief, based upon the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be, which has to be reasonable and not the belief of the reasonable man: R v Hawes (1994) 35 NSWLR 294 at 306. 
     
      
    7 In Conlon (1993) 69 A Crim R 92 Hunt CJ at CL, as a trial judge sitting without a jury, had to consider the relevance of the accused’s intoxication by alcohol and cannabis on the issue of self-defence. His Honour determined that intoxication was relevant both to a consideration of whether the accused had reasonable grounds for his belief that it was necessary to act to defend himself and the reasonableness of his response to his perceived need to defend himself. 
     
      
    8 In the course of his judgment his Honour stated (at 98-99): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown, however, argued that the decision as to whether there were reasonable grounds for any belief on the part of the accused that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did was a completely objective one. But it is clear from the formulation of the issue in  
        Zecevic v DPP 
         that it is the belief of the accused, and not that of the hypothetical reasonable person in the position of the accused, which has to be reasonable. And the reference in the joint judgment of Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ (at 658; 171) to ""the requirement of reasonableness"" as having ""remained part of the law of self-defence"" since it was an ingredient of the law of excusable homicide suggests to me that they did not intend to depart from the nature of the analogous decisions posed in relation to self-defence in  
        Viro 
        , as to whether the accused reasonably believed that he was threatened with an attack and as to whether he believed that his response to that threat was reasonably proportionate to the danger which he believed that he faced. The first of those analogous decisions was a mixture of the objective and the subjective; it was not completely objective, in the sense of what a reasonable person would have believed, but rather it was what the accused himself might reasonably have believed in all the circumstances in which he found himself: see proposition 1(b) as expressed by Mason J in  
        Viro (at 146) 
        ; see also  
        Helmhout 
         (1979) 1 A Crim R 464 at 467-468, a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court. The second decision was completely subjective, in the sense that it required no more than a subjective belief that reasonable proportionality existed where in fact it did not:  
        Viro 
         (at 143), per Mason J;  
        Zecevic v DPP 
         (at 672; 181-182), per Deane J.  
         
         
        It seems to me that it would require a very clear statement by the High Court that it had intended to substitute a completely objective assessment for that of a mixed objective and subjective nature as had been posed in  
        Viro 
        . No such statement has been made, and the issue does not appear to have been discussed in any case since  
        Zecevic v DPP 
        . The submission by the Crown that the decision is a completely objective one is rejected.  
         
         
        That, however, does not resolve the problem which arises in the present case. Although the mixed objective and subjective nature of the assessment as to whether the accused's belief was based on reasonable grounds means that account must be taken of those personal characteristics of this particular accused which might affect his appreciation of the gravity of the threat which he faced and as to the reasonableness of his response to that danger, the Crown has argued (as an alternative to the argument which I have rejected) that voluntarily induced intoxication through the consumption of alcohol or drugs should not be taken into account as such a personal characteristic because (it is said) to do so would entitle those whose perceptions are mistaken by reason only of such intoxication to kill with impunity.  
         
         
        No judgment of an Australian court (reported or unreported) given  
        since 
          
        Zecevic v DPP 
         has been found which insists that such a personal characteristic should be excluded from this assessment. The issue appears, surprisingly, not to have been discussed. It has been discussed in England, although the law relating to self-defence there has developed somewhat differently to the way in which it has now been stated by the High Court in  
        Zecevic v DPP 
        .  
         
        
       
      
    9 His Honour then proceeded to consider a number of English cases and the decision in McCullough v R [1982] Tas R 43 in which the view had been taken that the intoxication of the accused was irrelevant to a consideration of the reasonableness of his response to the threat he perceived. Hunt CJ at CL refused to follow those cases in light of statements made by members of the High Court in Zecevic v DPP. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, therefore, I should take into account the voluntarily induced intoxication of the accused in the present case - in so far as it may have affected either his appreciation of the gravity of the threat which he faced or the reasonableness of his response to that danger - in determining whether the Crown has established that there were no reasonable grounds for a belief by him that it was necessary in self-defence to fire the bullet into the head of Hulands which in fact caused his death, with the intention of at least inflicting grievous bodily harm upon him.” 
         
        
       
      
    10 The common law, therefore, provided that self-defence existed where the accused (a) believed that he was called upon to defend himself, (b) that his conduct was necessary in order to defend himself and (c) that he had reasonable grounds for each of those beliefs. The intoxication of the accused was relevant to a consideration of each of those matters. 
     
      
    11 On 1 December 1998 the Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998 came into operation. The relevant provisions of that Act were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        6.Self-defence  
         
        An occupant of a dwelling house may act in self-defence against an intruder if the occupant believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so.  
         
         
        7.Defence of other persons  
         
        An occupant of a dwelling house may act in defence of any other person in the dwelling house against an intruder if the occupant believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so.  
         
         
        8.Defence of property  
         
        An occupant of a dwelling house may act in defence of any property of, or within, the dwelling house against an intruder if the occupant believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so.  
         
         
        9.Reasonable grounds  
         
        Whether grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of section 6, 7 or 8 is to be determined having regard to the belief of the occupant, based on the circumstances as the occupant perceived them to be.  
         
         
        11.Immunity from criminal liability  
         
        (1)  
        An occupant of a dwelling house who acts in accordance with section 6, 7 or 8 is immune from criminal liability resulting from his or her acts.  
         
        
       
      
    12 The operation of those provisions was considered in R v Munro [2001] NSWCCA 187. That was an appeal against a verdict of guilty in a trial by judge alone conducted by Badgery-Parker AJ. In dismissing the appeal Stein JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “43 At the trial counsel for the accused argued that while s 6 of the Act did not depart from the common law with respect to self-defence, other provisions did so depart. It was submitted that s 9 extended the rights of an occupier at common law. 
         
         
        44 Section 9 provides: 
         
          
          Whether grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of section 6, 7, or 8 is to be determined having regard to the belief of the occupant, based on the circumstances as the occupant perceived them to be. 
          
         
         
        45 Counsel had submitted that the words ‘having regard to’ required the belief of the occupant to be taken into account in determining whether the grounds for that belief were reasonable. With respect to this Badgery-Parker AJ said: 
         
          
          ‘The interpretation of s 9 for which Mr Toomey contends would require that the phrase ""the belief of the occupant"" in s 9 was intended to refer to a belief on the part of the occupant, not that it was necessary for him to act as he did in self-defence (the belief to which s 6 refers) but rather a belief on his part that he had reasonable grounds for believing that it was necessary for him to act as he did in self-defence.’ 
          
         
         
        46 In rejecting the contention his Honour said: 
         
          
          ‘The significance of the words in s 9, ""having regard to the belief of the occupant"" is to emphasise that the determination which has to be made ""whether the grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of s 6"" is a determination about the grounds upon which the occupant himself (the actual person, not some hypothetical person in the same position as the occupant) held the relevant belief.’ 
          
         
         
        47 In my opinion, this conclusion is correct. As his Honour said, the construction contended for would make it almost impossible to apply s 10(b) of the Act. Nor was there anything in the language of s 9 to suggest that the word ‘belief’ did not have the same connotation as ‘believe’ in s 6, referring to the belief (for the purposes of s 6) which the occupant must hold so that he may lawfully act in self defence against an intruder. 
         
         
        48 As his Honour noted, the conclusion that he had reached was entirely consistent with the second reading speech which repeatedly emphasises that the purpose of the Act was to declare and codify the common law. 
         
         
        49 I agree with his Honour’s conclusion on this issue and the reasoning which underlay it.” 
        
       
      
    13 On 22 February 2002 the Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998 was repealed by s 4 of the Crimes Amendment (Self Defence) Act 2001. That later Act amended the Crimes Act by inserting into it the current provisions of Part 11 Division 3. In her Second Reading Speech introducing the Crimes Amendment (Self Defence) Act 2001 the relevant Minister indicated that the provisions were based, with two exceptions, upon the recommendations of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (MCCOC). The Minister said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn now to the model proposed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. That model removes the objective element of the test as to what the defendant perceived the danger to be. This represents the common law before the case of  
        Zecevic v DPP (Vic) 
         (1987) 162 CLR 645. It means that a person who really thought they were in danger, even if they were mistaken about that perception, may be able to rely on self-defence for their actions. The person's actions on the basis of their belief still has to be reasonable, but the belief itself is totally based on their circumstances as the person perceived them to be………………. 
        
       
       
        
        The Bill follows the general concept of self-defence laid down by the Model Criminal Code, so that a defendant who actually believed it was necessary to do what he or she did to repel an attack, even if they were wrong about that perception, may seek to rely on self-defence, so long as it was a reasonable response in the circumstances  
        as perceived 
         by the defendant. However the Bill contains two fundamental departures from the Model Criminal Code.” 
        
       
      
    14 Those two departures were the re-introduction of the concept of excessive self-defence in relation to murder and the extent of the right to defend property neither of which are relevant to the present issue. The Minister, having referred to those two matters in detail, went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Bill repeals the  
        Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998 
         and the  
        Workplace (Occupants Protection) Act 2001 
         so that the law can apply uniformly across all situations where self-defence might arise. It will effectively abolish the current common law regarding self-defence. In every case it will be the general concept of self-defence, as codified in the Bill, which will apply. However, the common law is not made irrelevant—the provisions in the Bill are firmly grounded in common law principles.” 
        
       
      
    15 In December 1992 MCCOC issued its Final Report on the subject of Chapter 2 of the proposed Model Criminal Code. That chapter deals with the general principles of criminal responsibility. MCCOC proposed a provision dealing with self-defence which is in almost identical terms with that contained in s 418 of the Crimes Act. It is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “313 Self-defence 
         
        A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the conduct constituting the offence was carried out by him or her in self-defence. 
         
         
        313.1 Conduct is carried out by a person in self-defence if the person believed that the conduct was necessary: 
         
          
          - - to defend himself or herself or another person; or 
           
            
            - to prevent or terminate the unlawful imprisonment of himself or another person, or 
             
            - to protect property from unlawful appropriation, destruction, damage or interference, or 
             
            - to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, 
            
           
          his or her conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as perceived by him or her. 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 In explanation of this provision the report stated (at 69): 
     
      
       
        
        “The test as to necessity is subjective but the test as to proportion is objective. It requires the response to of the accused to be objectively proportionate to the situation which the accused subjectively believed she or he faced (the words “as perceived by him or her” were added to make this clear). The approach is consistent with s 46 of the Tasmanian Code.” 
        
       
      
    17 It should be noted that the decision in McCullough, which Hunt CJ at CL distinguished in Conlon, concerned the interpretation of s 46 of the Tasmanian Code. In McCullough the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion the learned trial judge in these passages properly directed the jury that the test of reasonableness under s. 46(2) is a subjective test, in the limited sense that the question to be considered by the jury was whether it was reasonable for the applicant in all his then circumstances to hold the relevant apprehension and to have the relevant belief (cf.  
        Muratovic 
         [1967] Qd R 15 at 201). It is true that the learned trial judge did not tell the jury that one such circumstance to be taken into account was the applicant's state of partial intoxication (if they thought he was in that state), but since that was one of his then circumstances the jury would have taken it into account, and it would have been proper to do so, in relation to the issue whether the applicant in fact held the apprehension and the belief to which the subsection refers. But it would have been a wrong direction to tell the jury that they could or should take such state of intoxication into account in deciding whether or not the applicant's apprehension and belief, if he held them, were reasonable or held on reasonable grounds. The criterion of reasonableness is in its nature an objective one, and in our view it would be incongruous and wrong to contemplate the proposition that a person's exercise of judgment might be unreasonable if he was sober, but reasonable because he was drunk. Any more positive or detailed direction than the learned trial judge gave was unnecessary, but if a more specific direction were to be given it should be in the terms that a person's state of intoxication may be taken into account in considering whether or not he held the apprehension and belief to which subs. 46 (2) refers, but not in respect of whether such apprehension and belief were reasonable or held on reasonable grounds.” 
        
       
      
    18 In the present case the Crown has contended that, even if Conlon represented the common law position on the assessment of reasonable grounds for the accused’s belief as to what conduct was necessary in self-defence, it does not represent the position with respect to a “reasonable response” under s 418, which provision, it was submitted does not, and was not intended to, codify the common law. The Crown’s submission was that, although intoxication is relevant to an assessment of the belief held by the accused as to what conduct was necessary in his self-defence and as to the circumstances perceived by the accused, it is not relevant to an assessment of the reasonableness of the accused’s response to those circumstances. 
     
      
    19 Mr Cusack QC for the accused has argued that the common law as stated by Hunt CJ at CL should be maintained in the interpretation of s 418 as, in his submission, the terms of the section do not manifest a clear intention on the part of the Parliament to displace the common law requirement that intoxication be considered both when determining the belief of the accused and the reasonableness of his conduct. He points out that had Parliament wished to bring about the result, for which the Crown contends, it could have easily done so by using the term “a reasonable person” which would have picked up s 428F of the Crimes Act. That section states: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, for the purposes of determining whether a person is guilty of an offence, it is necessary to compare the state of mind of the person with that of a reasonable person, the comparison is to be made between the conduct or state of mind of the person and that of a reasonable person who is not intoxicated.” 
        
       
      
    20 However, it should be noted that s 418(2) is concerned not with the state of mind of a reasonable person but with the reasonableness of the conduct of the accused having regard to his or her state of mind. 
     
      
    21 In my view the Crown’s submission should be accepted. I acknowledge that to do so is a departure from the common law position as pronounced in Conlon to the possible detriment of an accused person but such a result flows from a consideration both of the words of the section and of the history of the legislation that I have set out briefly above. 
     
      
    22 The question now posed for the jury, where there is evidence raising self-defence, is not the same as it was at common law after Zecevic v DPP and as it was considered in Conlon. The questions to be asked by the jury under s 418 are: (i) is there is a reasonable possibility that the accused believed that his or her conduct was necessary in order to defend himself or herself; and, (2) if there is, is there also a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he or she perceived them. 
     
      
    23 The first issue is determined from a completely subjective point of view considering all the personal characteristics of the accused at the time he or she carried out the conduct. The second issue is determined by an entirely objective assessment of the proportionality of the accused’s response to the situation the accused subjectively believed he or she faced. The Crown will negative self-defence if it proves beyond reasonable doubt either (i) that the accused did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to act as he or she did in his or her own defence or (ii) that what the accused did was not a reasonable response to the danger, as he or she perceived it to be. 
     
      
    24 The issue as to the reasonableness of the accused’s response is objective in so far as the jury is not concerned with what the accused believed was necessary to respond to the circumstances as he or she perceived them to be. The current provision is not concerned with whether the accused’s belief as to what was the necessary response was a reasonable one or whether he or she had reasonable grounds for that belief. This is where the current provisions are in contrast to the position at common law: the accused need not have reasonable grounds for his or her belief that it was necessary to act in the way he or she did in order to defend himself or herself. It is sufficient if the accused genuinely holds that belief. 
     
      
    25 It will be a matter for the jury to decide what matters it should take into account when determining whether the response of the accused was reasonable in the circumstances in which he or she found himself or herself. The jury is not assessing the response of the ordinary or reasonable person but the response of the accused. In making that assessment it is obvious than some of the personal attributes of the accused will be relevant just as will be some of the surrounding physical circumstances in which the accused acted. So matters such as the age of the accused, his or her gender, or the state of his or her health may be regarded by the jury. Whether or not some particular personal characteristic of the accused is to be considered will depend largely upon the particular facts of the case. 
     
      
    26 But in my opinion one matter that must be irrelevant to an assessment of the reasonableness of the accused’s response is his or her state of sobriety. As was pointed out in McCullough, it is logically incongruous “to contemplate the proposition that a person's exercise of judgment might be unreasonable if he was sober, but reasonable because he was drunk”. Apart from Conlon, I am not aware of any other decision that has held that intoxication is a matter relevant to an evaluation of the reasonableness of the conduct or belief of a person. It is not relevant at common law to an evaluation of the accused’s response to provocation or the belief of a reasonable person as to the dangerousness of the accused’s actions for the offence of manslaughter. 
     
      
    27 In Conlon Hunt CJ at CL expressed the view that he was not prepared to introduce the policy applied in the interpretation of s 46 of the Tasmanian Code in McCullough to the interpretation of the decision in Zecevic v DPP. I do not believe that I am similarly constrained. As I have indicated s 418 is not, and was not intended to be, a codification of the common law. Further, the general policy adopted by the legislature in respect of the relevance of intoxication to the criminal law is contained in Part 11A of the Crimes Act. The provisions of that Part have limited the use that a court can make of the fact that an accused is intoxicated when considering criminal responsibility. In my view, if the policy enunciated in Part 11A were not adopted in construing s 418, the result would be to create an illogical and unacceptable inconsistency in the criminal law of this State with regard to the relevance of intoxication to criminal responsibility. 
     
      
    28 For these reasons I directed the jury to the effect that they must take into account the accused’s intoxication when considering whether he might have believed that it was necessary to act as he did in defence of himself and when considering the circumstances as he perceived them, but not when assessing whether his response to those circumstances was reasonable.

     Tort – negligence – personal injury – employer’s liability – independent contractor –fall from ladder in course of work – reasonable foreseeability – duty of care – breach – relevance of plaintiff’s experienceContract – implied term – contractual duty of careTort – breach of statutory duty – sufficiency of evidence to support claim ofThe plaintiff fell from a ladder upon which he was working installing Christmas decorations under contract for the defendant. He suffered head and other injuries and sued the defendant for damages in negligence for failing to ensure the plaintiff’s adequate safety and in contract for breach of a corresponding duty of care as an implied term of the contract. Master Harrison dismissed the claims. The plaintiff appealed and sought leave to argue that the defendant was liable in damages for breach of statutory duty in tort under Construction Safety Regulations 1950 (NSW) Reg 73.Held (Heydon JA, Meagher JA and Foster AJA agreeing), dismissing the appeal,1. The defendant did not put the plaintiff in a position of working at such a height as to pose an obvious risk of falling. For persons experienced in that type of work the risk was not obvious. Apprehension of risk by a third party did not demonstrate an obvious risk to the plaintiff: [65].

     2. Foreseeability was not an “undemanding” test where simple uncomplicated operations by an employee within the normal system of work are concerned. The position could not be different for independent contractors: [66].

     3. While it may be reasonably foreseeable that many men in the plaintiff’s position would fall off a ladder, the plaintiff was a skilled workman experienced in the type of repetitive work concerned. He had done this kind of work for years without mishap. The defendant was entitled to assume that the plaintiff would identify and eliminate relevant risks and could not reasonably foresee that the plaintiff would be harmed for failure to do so: [72]. 
      
       
       Stevens v Brodribb Saw Milling Co Pty Ltd 
        (1986) 160 CLR 16 considered. 
       
     Observations (Heydon JA) on apprehension of dangerous circumstances: 
      
       
       The fact that the higher up a ladder one moves the more care one must take for one’s own safety was a simple fact affecting human existence in the physical world which adults in industrialised societies learn well before they become adults. It was as fundamental, elementary and clear as facts such as that broken glass needs to be handled with care: [74]. 
       
     4. The contractual duty of care had the same content as the tortious duty of care and failed for the same reasons: [53].5. Precise measurement of the height of the ladder was crucial to the claim for breach of statutory duty under Construction Safety Regulations 1950 (NSW) Reg 73 but was lacking. Had the issue been raised at trial, it was possible that evidence could have been called to deal with it. Leave to argue the ground was denied: [104].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Heydon JA.  
      
       
     2 HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by the plaintiff below against an order made by Master Harrison on 15 December 2000 that there be a verdict and judgment in favour of the defendant and an order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs. The trial took nine days. The reasons for judgment adopted the sensible course of setting out the Master’s opinions on various questions which it was not necessary for her to decide, thereby reducing the risk of a new trial in the event of an appeal succeeding on liability. These questions included contributory negligence and damages.  
      
       
     3 The plaintiff’s Notice of Appeal attacked the Master’s reasoning which led to her conclusions on liability and her reasoning in relation to contributory negligence and damages. The plaintiff also sought leave to amend the Notice of Appeal by altering the mode of expression of the ground relating to contributory negligence, and by adding two new grounds. The application for leave to add one of those latter two grounds was opposed by the defendant. For its part, the defendant filed a Notice of Cross Appeal complaining about the Master’s provisional assessment in relation to contributory negligence, and about her damages assessments in relation to past and future economic loss and care. The defendant also filed a Notice of Contention.  
      
       
        
       The Master’s approach in outline 
        
       
     4 On 27 October 1996 the plaintiff, then aged 23, was injured when he fell off a ladder on which he was working. 
      
       
     5 It was common ground between the parties that the facts were simple: but each saw the simplicity in different ways. In fact the Master was faced with significant difficulties of fact finding, because the plaintiff could not remember precisely how he fell, no eye witness to the early part of his fall was called, and there was an exiguity of relevant circumstantial evidence.  
      
       
     6 The plaintiff had been engaged on 11 October 1996 pursuant to a document signed by him to install and dismantle Christmas decorations at various locations. It was a type of work which the plaintiff had carried out for the defendant in earlier years. On 27 October the plaintiff and a team of workers assisting him were installing decorations at the Imperial Arcade, a shopping centre in Pitt Street, Sydney. The job was to be completed that day. The plaintiff was using a ladder owned by the defendant which he had used in previous years and which he had used at that site. It was a twelve foot aluminium ladder with steps on one side and cross beams on the other. 
      
       
     7 The Master then said (at para [41]): 
      
       
        
         
         “An employee Joris Smink who was part of the plaintiff’s team, was placing Christmas garlands flush against the awning under the barge board on the Pitt Street entrance to the arcade (see Ex D). In previous years the garland was looped onto the awning. In the 1996 year the garland was placed flush against the awning. To perform this task more hooks were required to be inserted than had been required in previous years. The ladder had to be moved constantly. The ceiling hooks had to be placed on the stepped part of the roof so that the garland could be hung. Mr Smink had carried out this procedure on the lower part of the awning and on the stepped part of the awning. He felt uncomfortable carrying out this task at a higher level and chose not to continue as he thought it was dangerous.”  
         
        
       
     8 Mr Smink had been working outside the Imperial Arcade, and facing it. The Master then said (at paras [42]-[43]): 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff decided to personally undertake the work that Mr Smink thought was dangerous. The plaintiff was obliged to carry out the work at height and place the hooks in the higher part of the awning. To carry out this task he climbed the ladder. He placed his feet on the next rung down from the top of the ladder to affix the hooks into the stepped part of the roof overhead. The plaintiff reached up full stretch with one arm and leant forward to clip the hook in. He does not remember whether it was his left or right arm (T29.35). He then had to affix the garland. After inserting a number of hooks the plaintiff would descend the ladder and move it along the ground in the direction in which he was working. He would then ascend the ladder in order to place the hooks into the awning. To reach full stretch he could use only one side of his body. He was using one hand to clip the hook in. He would use either his right or left hand to position the hooks depending how far along the stepped awning he could reach.  
         
        
        
         
         … Just prior to falling the plaintiff was standing on the second top step of the ladder. The top of the ladder connected with the bottom of his shin. He can remember reaching out but cannot recall whether or not he put the hook in the slotted part (T31). The plaintiff has no recollection of his fall or lying on the ground. His next recollection is being in hospital.” 
         
        
        
       After the fall, a schoolgirl, Kathryn Hancock, came to the plaintiff’s aid in a manner rightly praised by the Master. Kathryn Hancock saw the latter part, but not the initial part, of the plaintiff’s fall.  
        
       
     9 In the fall the plaintiff suffered serious injuries, particularly to his head. He is now blind in one eye, suffered brain damage, has experienced a worsening in his pre-existing epileptic condition, and suffers from depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  
      
       
     10 The Master found (at para [28]): 
      
       
        
         
         “The language of the contract [of 11 October 1996] is clear. The plaintiff was engaged by the defendant as an independent contractor. As such there was an implied term of the contract that the defendant would take reasonable care not to injure the plaintiff.“ 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     11 In addition to that contractual duty, the Master found that the defendant owed the plaintiff duties in tort on the basis that he was an independent contractor (at para [34]): 
      
       
        
         
         “the defendant, in tort, had a legal obligation to provide the plaintiff with a safe system of work. As previously stated, in contract the defendant had a duty to take reasonable care not to injure the plaintiff. These duties are not inconsistent.” 
         
        
       
     12 The Master then rejected one way in which the plaintiff put his case in the Statement of Claim: that on 11 October 1996 the plaintiff had suffered a fit or seizure to the defendant’s knowledge, so that it was unsafe for the plaintiff to work at any height off the ground “unless he was properly secured from falling in the event of a fit or seizure”: Statement of Claim para 17. The event referred to was a blackout suffered by the plaintiff during a training session on 11 October 1996 while he was untangling and testing some Christmas lights. He was placed under observation in hospital for two hours. He returned to work the next day. On 14 October 1996 he told Michael Clarkson, an officer of the defendant, that it could not be determined whether he had been electrocuted and that he was undergoing some tests. The Master said (at para [38]): 
      
       
        
         
         “In these circumstances, it is my view the defendant has discharged its duty of care owed to the plaintiff when it became aware that the plaintiff may have suffered an electric shock. After the plaintiff became unconscious an ambulance was called and the plaintiff was taken to hospital. The plaintiff returned to work the next day and carried out his work in a normal manner. Three days after the accident the plaintiff told his employer he felt fine. The plaintiff also said that although it could not be determined whether he had been electrocuted, he was undergoing some tests. The day the plaintiff blacked out the defendant had the wiring checked by an electrician. Nothing untoward was found. The defendant was entitled to rely on the plaintiff’s assurance that he was fine and the observations made by Tim Clarkson [another officer of the defendant] that the plaintiff had continued to carry out his work properly after he had been hospitalised. It was up to the plaintiff to decide whether or not he was fit to climb the ladder. There is no breach of duty of care so this part of the plaintiff’s claim fails.” 
         
        
        
       The plaintiff does not complain about that conclusion in this appeal. Another ground for rejecting that part of the plaintiff’s claim is that, as will be seen, the Master found that the cause of the plaintiff’s fall was not an epileptic fit.  
        
       
     13 So far as the events of 27 October 1996 are concerned, the Master said (at para [50]): 
      
       
        
         
         “on the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff did not suffer an epileptic fit which caused him to fall. The plaintiff fell because he was standing on the second top step of the ladder while reaching overhead and outwards at full stretch to put a hook in the slotted part of the awning. He overbalanced and fell from the ladder to the ground suffering serious injuries.” 
         
        
       
     14 The Master took into account a principle which she stated as follows (at para [52]): 
      
       
        
         
         “In the case of skilled independent contractors who encounter risks ordinarily incident to the work they are invited onto the premises to perform, reasonable men and women in the position of the defendant would not foresee or if they did foresee would not think it reasonably necessary to guard against the occurrence of those injuries which are ordinary incidents of the work. … .” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     15 The Master then summarised the evidence of Tim Clarkson, who was about the plaintiff’s height and build, that after the accident he took over the plaintiff’s role, and found the ladder to be stable. After setting out parts of the evidence of two engineering experts, Dr Adams and Dr Olsen, the Master said (at paras [62]-[66]): 
      
       
        
         
         “I accept that the plaintiff was under time constraints and he was the one with the responsibility to ensure that the job was completed by the end of the day. However, the plaintiff had been told by Mr Smink that he (Smink) refused to go any higher on the ladder to carry out the work because it was too risky. The plaintiff nevertheless chose to ascend the ladder to the step nearest the top of the ladder and reach overhead to a full stretch outside the style [sic] area of the ladder. The plaintiff was experienced as he had been doing this type of work for a number of years. I infer that the plaintiff knew that this was dangerous and that he was taking a risk, but nevertheless elected to carry on with the job. As the plaintiff was the supervisor in charge of the job, he could have easily requested an employee to hold the ladder for him so that it was more stable. He chose not to give that direction.  
         
        
        
         
         Alternatively the plaintiff could have moved the ladder in the direction he was working on a more frequent basis thus minimising the area of his reach. Although it may have taken more time he would not be called upon to reach outside the centre of his mass and he would have been securely balanced. This is exactly the mode which Tim Clarkson adopted when he completed the job later that day.  
         
        
        
         
         It is my view that the accident was caused when the plaintiff elected to place himself in a precarious position at the top of the ladder and over reached. The plaintiff lost his balance and fell with very serious consequences The plaintiff did not take care of his own safety, and was the author of his own misfortune. 
         
        
        
         
         It is my view that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would not have foreseen that there was a risk of injury to the plaintiff when he was installing the Christmas decorations on the awning by means of a ladder. The defendant would have expected that the experienced plaintiff would have known to either move the ladder more regularly or would have directed an employee of the defendant to hold the ladder steady. Accordingly, as the defendant did not breach the duty of care it owed to the plaintiff the plaintiff’s claim in negligence fails.  
         
        
        
         
         In relation to breach of contract, it is my view, for essentially the same reasons as above, that the defendant did not breach its contract with the plaintiff. The defendant took reasonable care not to injure the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s claim in contract also fails.” 
         
        
        
       What were the crucial findings of the Master? 
        
       
     16 To some extent there was controversy in the course of the appeal as to what precise findings the Master had made, what the significant aspects of her reasoning were, and what evidentiary support her reasoning had.  
      
       
        
       The competing theories of the parties 
        
       
     17 These submissions arose out of the Master’s attempts to find out how the accident happened and why the plaintiff fell. Among the potential causes were the following. The plaintiff’s foot could have slipped. He could have suffered an epileptic fit. He could have experienced sudden dizziness or light headedness leading to a loss of balance. The ladder could have been placed on the ground in an unstable fashion. The ladder could have been unstable because of moisture on the ground. The plaintiff could have performed some vigorous movement on the ladder causing a loss of balance. The plaintiff could have fallen by leaning sideways from the ladder until his centre of mass went beyond the side of the ladder.  
      
       
     18 The theory advanced by Dr Adams, an expert in ergonomics, on behalf of the plaintiff to explain the fall was that the ladder was unstable because of a combination of four factors: the plaintiff’s position on the second top rung, a lack of even support beneath the feet of the ladder, the fact that the ladder was not held or secured, and a “sideways reach and lean” by the plaintiff. Thus he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “the pavement, while being reasonably level, is not perfectly smooth and level. There is a strong probability that the four feet of the ladder may not have all been equally supported on that slightly uneven surface, thus allowing for some slight movement of the ladder as the person working on it moved. 
         
        
        
         
         Understandably, Mr Van-Der Sluice does not have a precise recollection of the location of the ladder in relation to the hooks that he was inserting and the garland that he was hanging. Noting that on the highest level beneath the awning the brackets to which the hooks were attached are spaced at approximately 600 mm (2 ft) centres, it is reasonable to infer that Mr Van-Der Sluice would have been attempting to attach as many as three hooks in a row from the one ladder location. If this had been the case then he would have been reaching to the side from the ladder on which he was standing and may inadvertently have moved so far as to take his centre of mass beyond the base of support of the ladder. If there was any movement whatsoever in the ladder which, it will be recalled, was not being held by his fellow worker, then Mr Van-Der Sluice could have been thrown off balance (as he was) and would have been unable to arrest the fall since there was absolutely nothing above or beside him which he could grab to arrest the fall. 
         
        
        
         
         As was noted in Section 2.1, Mr Van-Der Sluice was standing with his feet on the step immediately below the top of the ladder. It is universally recommended and is, in fact, advised in the form of a notice on most ladders on sale these days, that a person using a stepladder should not ascend above the second step from the top. It is a matter of simple physics that the higher a person goes on a ladder and/or the further they lean to the side while standing on a ladder the less stable the system (ladder plus person) becomes. Without more detailed information, which it is clearly impossible to obtain at this remove in time and with Mr Van Der-Sluice’s understandable inability to provide a clear and detailed recollection, I can only conclude that the combination of: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) His height on the ladder; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The somewhat uneven support beneath the ladder’s feet; 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) The fact that the ladder was not held or secured in any way; and 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) The movements possibly involving a sideways reach and lean; 
         
        
        
         
         was a combination which resulted in the instability of the system and Mr Van-Der Sluice’s fall.” 
         
        
        
       In oral evidence, Dr Adams advanced another theory. In explaining why even if the plaintiff was only standing on the fourth step from the top his conclusions would not be affected, he postulated that the surface on which the ladder was standing was not perfectly smooth, and that the ladder moved before the fall, having the result that the plaintiff attempted to regain balance and in the course of that attempt threw himself off balance completely. This can be left out of account. There is no evidence to support the proposition that the ladder moved, and no finding that the surface was not sufficiently smooth.  
        
       
     19 Dr Olsen, a consultant physician in occupational medicine, advanced different explanations on behalf of the defendant. He denied that the plaintiff was standing on the second step from the top, and said it would not have been possible for him to have stood on a step above the fourth step from the top: Blue 2/375N-R. He said there was no indication that the ladder was unstable: Blue 2/393U. On the (ultimately unsatisfactory) basis of a statement emanating from a person not called as a witness which was limited in its effect by reason of an order under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995, he ruled out “leaning sideways from [the] ladder”, “leaning heavily from the ladder”, and performing “vigorous” or “violent” movements while standing on the ladder: Blue 2/393Q and 394E. He thought an epileptic fit was the possible cause, given that the plaintiff was an epileptic and had suffered a fit some days earlier: Blue 3/394L-N. However, the Master said there was no evidence of this, Kathryn Hancock did not judge the plaintiff to be “rigid or shaking or jerking”, she did not see any other indication of a fit and the Master found that there was no fit. Further, neither expert relied on moisture on the ground as a cause of instability, and the Master found that the ground was not wet by reason of rain water.  
      
       
        
       What was “a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder”? 
        
       
     20 What did the Master mean by her statement that the plaintiff “chose to ascend the ladder to the step nearest to the top of the ladder and reach overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder”? The Macquarie Dictionary defines “stile” as “a vertical member in a wainscot, panelled door, or other piece of framing”. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) defines “stile” as “Each of the vertical bars of a wainscot, sash, panelled door, or other wooden framing”. The words “stile” and “style” appear to be interchangeable. The dictionary quotes the following usage: “In a rectangular frame … the tenons are commonly made on the shorter pieces, or the rails, and the mortises on the longer, or the styles”. This ladder was not made of wood, but of aluminium. It appears that the usage of the word “stiles” in relation to ladders extends beyond wooden ladders. In Dr Olsen’s report, he referred to the “stiles” of a stepladder as being the vertical forms linked by the steps. Thus he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Industrial stepladders may have a length measured along the stiles at 6.1m. The subject ladder was much less than this at approximately 3.7m. The distance between the stiles should not be less than 290mm and the measure of 300mm therefore would be in compliance. The distance between the stiles may vary although must vary uniformly along the length of the stiles. … The spread between stiles and back legs should be not less than 500mm and not greater than 660mm per metre length of stile, this would amount to 2.44m for a ladder with a stile of 7.4m. It would appear that the measurement taken of the spread between the stiles and the back legs may be incorrect as the photographs depicting the ladder do not appear to indicate a spread as great as 3m.” 
         
        
        
       An Australian and New Zealand Standard which he quoted (AS/NZS 1892.1:1996 Portable Ladders, Part 1: Metal) said on page 16: 
        
        
         
         “ 
         5.2 DISTANCE BETWEEN STILES 
          The front section of single-sided stepladders and both sections of double-sided stepladders shall be designed so that the clear distance between the inside faces of the stiles at the tread immediately below the top cap is not less than 290 mm, and either - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the distance between the stiles varies uniformly along the length (i.e. tapered stepladder); or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the stiles flare out at the bottom to increase stability.” 
         
        
        
       In the case of single-sided stepladders, a distinction was drawn between the stiles and the back legs: 
        
        
         
         “With the ladder in the fully open position, the clear distance between the rear edge of the stiles and the front edge of the back legs shall be not less than 500 mm and not greater than 660 mm per metre length of stile.” 
         
        
       
     21 At para [40] the Master’s language did not correspond with the usages just indicated. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was a 12’ aluminium ladder with steps on one side and two stiles holding it together on the other side. There were cross beams holding the stiles together.” 
         
        
        
       Here the Master applied the word “stiles” to what AS/NZS 1892.1:1996 called “back legs”. This difference lacks significance, because nothing in the evidence suggests that the back legs were differently proportioned from the stiles encasing the steps on the front part of the ladder. 
        
       
     22 Dr Adams gave oral evidence in which he said a ladder was not a suitable platform for the plaintiff to carry out his task unless “the ladder was high enough for the worker to be able to reach comfortably directly in line with the channel encompassed by the two styles of the ladder”. He expressed the same idea in speaking of a worker who “was able to reach above or in front of himself, directly within the envelope encompassed by the two styles of the ladder”. The Master referred to this evidence in para [56]: 
      
       
        
         
         “[Dr Adams] gave evidence that had the plaintiff been able to reach above or in front of himself, directly within the envelope encompassed by the two styles and without any significant force being required, the ladder could be used.” 
         
        
        
       That notion appears to be what the Master was dealing with in saying, in para [62], that the plaintiff chose to “reach overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder”. She cannot have meant that this was a stretch beyond the top step: the plaintiff’s shins were, on her findings, opposite the top step. She must have been referring to two imaginary lines extending upwards from the point where the stiles ceased.  
        
       
     23 The Master’s adoption of this explanation for the plaintiff’s fall must rest on an assumption that the plaintiff reached not only overhead, but outside the stile area to a point where his centre of mass went beyond the base of support of the ladder. That was advanced by Dr Adams as a partial explanation for the fall, as has been seen. It is clear that there was no evidence that the ladder was held and secured, but the other key elements of his analysis are debatable. There are doubts about precisely which step the plaintiff was on; and even Dr Adams put “a sideways reach and lean movement” as only a possibility. There was no evidence that the support for the ladder was uneven. However, the Master appears to have accepted three of Dr Adams’ four elements, and to have held that the plaintiff was on the step nearest the top, the ladder was not stably secured, and there was a sideways reach and lean by the plaintiff so as to take his centre of mass beyond the base of support of the ladder.  
      
       
        
       Did the Master make any finding that the plaintiff’s method of work was to install three hooks at each positioning of the ladder? 
         
        
       
     24 Ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal, and the supporting written submission of the plaintiff, suggested that the Master had made a finding that the plaintiff’s method of work was to install three hooks at each positioning of the ladder – one to the left, one to the right, and one straight above him. If this finding had been made and if it had evidentiary support, it would tend to support the Master’s conclusion that the plaintiff fell when reaching “overhead and outwards at full stretch to put a hook in the slotted part of the awning” as she said in para [50], or reaching “overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder” as she said in para [62], or reaching “outside the centre of his mass” as she said in para [63], or “overreached” as she said in para [64]. This conclusion is also implicit in the Master’s statement in para [65]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant would have expected that the experienced plaintiff would have known to either move the ladder more regularly or would have directed an employee of the defendant to hold the ladder steady.”  
         
        
        
       See also the first sentence of [63].  
        
       
     25 In its written submissions the defendant went to some lengths to demonstrate that the Master made no findings about the plaintiff habitually inserting three hooks at each positioning of the ladder, and that there was no evidence to support any such proposition. This was understandable since a key element of Dr Adams’ reasoning was that it was: 
      
       
        
         
         “reasonable to infer that [the plaintiff] would have been attempting to attach as many as three hooks in a row from the one ladder location. If this had been the case then he would have been reaching to the side from the ladder on which he was standing and may inadvertently have moved so far as to take his centre of mass beyond the base of support of the ladder.”  
         
        
        
       That reasoning was adopted by the plaintiff on appeal thus:  
        
        
         
         “it’s entirely possible that in the circumstances of the inconvenience of moving the ladder for every single hook, it’s entirely likely that anybody having made their way to the top of this ladder would do as much as they could even at the increased risk of seeking to do one which was two feet – bearing in mind that the appellant is not positioned on one point on the step on which he’s standing, he can of course move to the left and to the right to the width of the ladder, thus allowing him to move obviously from the right hand side of the ladder, it’s not especially imaginative to think that he was reaching out a little to the right and conversely a little to the left.” 
         
        
       
     26 The defendant adopted a different stance in oral argument, no doubt for some good tactical reason, and indicated that its stance in oral argument was its preferred position. However, so far as there was a debate between the parties on this issue, it illuminates the Master’s reasoning and the evidence relevant to it.  
      
       
     27 The defendant’s submissions that the Master made no finding that the plaintiff had a practice of inserting three hooks at each positioning of the ladder, and that there was no evidence about it, were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “She recorded the appellant’s evidence that ‘after inserting a number of hooks’ (not further particularised in the evidence or in any finding), the plaintiff would descend the ladder and move it along the ground to the next working position (para 42). She also recorded that, in his report of 1 September 1998, Dr Adams ‘inferred  
         if 
          the plaintiff was attempting to attach as many as three hooks in a row from the one ladder location …’ he might become unstable (para 55). She made no finding to that effect. The appellant’s evidence does not support any such finding as that suggested; see T31 line 40-line 50; T29 line 10-line 40; T 65 line 40-line 50. In fact that evidence is  
         against 
          any suggestion that three hooks from each positioning of the ladder could be fixed; the burden of the appellant’s evidence is that he was at full stretch ‘to reach up’. It must follow from that evidence that the appellant could only reach an affixation point directly above him. The suggestion that he was required to ‘reach out to the left and the right of the ladder’ is not supported by the evidence and, to the extent that the learned Master’s findings are to the contrary (see below), it is contended that she is wrong.” 
         
        
       
     28 The written material indicated by the words “see below” is as follows. It was advanced in support of Ground 2 of the Notice of Contention, which is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The findings that the Appellant fell because he reached outwards at full stretch (para 50), that he reached overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder (para 62) and that he over-reached, lost his balance and fell (para 64) were wrong; the Appellant failed to prove the causal mechanism of his fall from the ladder.” 
         
        
       
     29 The written material in question is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in finding that: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the appellant fell because he reached outwards at full stretch (para 50); 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the appellant reached overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder (para 62); 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the appellant over-reached, lost his balance and fell (para 64). 
         
        
        
         
         There was no evidence to support such a finding or findings. 
         
        
        
         
         The relevant evidence is at T29 line 5 to T31 line 50; cross examination is at T65 line 43 to line 50. 
         
        
        
         
         There was no other evidence except for assumptions and speculation by Dr Adams in his report 1 September 1998 (dealt with in the judgment at para 55). 
         
        
        
         
         There was no evidence that the appellant, at the time of the accident, or at any other time, allowed or permitted his centre of mass to move beyond the base of support of the ladder. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence that the ladder moved in any way; Ms Hancock did not see the appellant beginning to fall (T134 line 30). She could not recall taking notice of the ladder after he fell (T134 line 40). To the best of her recollection, she did not hear anything before the appellant fell (T134 line 2). 
         
        
        
         
         The learned Master rejected the case that the appellant’s fall was initiated by an epileptic fit (para 50 of the judgment). 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence of the cause of the appellant’s fall, other than his failure to make use of Smink to hold the ladder.  
         
        
        
         
         The appellant was engaged to achieve a result within the specification prescribed by the respondent He was competent to control the system of work without supervision or other action by the respondent once a suitable ladder was provided; the Master found that a sound and suitable ladder was provided (para 54). The evidence of Dr Olsen (Exhibit 14; paras 60 and 61) permitted that finding. 
         
        
        
         
         The Master found at paras 62 to 64 that the appellant’s conduct within his own area of responsibility was the cause of his fall. Authority supports that approach ([ 
         Stevens v Brodribb Saw Milling Co Pty Ltd  
         (1986) 160 CLR 16] at 30.9 and 47.9). 
         
        
        
         
         Even if the appellant was an employer, there was no breach of duty – the cause of the injury was solely the appellant’s failure to take care. The principle recognised in  
         The Liability of Employers 
          by Glass & Others at p 45.7 is applicable – any causative fault was within an area of responsibility allocated by the law to the appellant.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     30 The plaintiff’s reply in relation to this Notice of Contention material was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Appellant submits that it was open to the Learned Master to infer each of the factual findings attacked (a) from the Appellant’s evidence (at T29), (b) from factual findings of which no complaint is made, and (c) from the circumstance that the Respondent’s employee Smink was not called, leading to a  
         Jones v Dunkel 
          inference. No position contrary to his evidence as to his position on the ladder was put to the Appellant in cross-examination. The Appellant identifies findings from which the inferences impugned may properly be drawn as the findings numbered 1 ( 
         Appellant fell 
         ), 56 ( 
         full stretch with one arm 
         ), 57 ( 
         descend after a number of hooks 
         ), 58 ( 
         either left or right hand to position hooks 
         ), 59 ( 
         Appellant was on second top step 
         ), 60 ( 
         Appellant recalls reaching out 
         ) and 76 ( 
         Appellant trying to meet deadline 
         ). The Master, having negatived the possibility that the Appellant had fallen in consequence of an epileptic fit, was entitled to apply commonsense in the determination of that which probably occurred.” 
         
        
        
       The reference to numbered findings is a reference to a document prepared by the plaintiff for this appeal headed “Factual Findings”. It sets out 74 propositions which are said to be findings, each having a reference to the Master’s reasons for judgment.  
        
       
     31 It is convenient to concentrate on these arguments, for the moment, solely in relation to the question of whether the plaintiff was stretching sideways or putting in more than one hook on each occasion the ladder was repositioned. This debate raises two issues. First, did the Master make any factual findings supportive of the proposition which the plaintiff relies on? Secondly, so far as she did not, was there any evidence to support that proposition? 
      
       
     32 The Master’s findings relied on by the plaintiff as findings from which the proposition contended for may be inferred are as follows. As to the finding numbered 1, in para [1] she said the plaintiff “fell off a ladder”. As to the findings numbered 56, 57 and 58, in para [42] she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff reached up fell stretch with one arm and leant forward to clip the hook in. He does not remember whether it was his left or right arm (T29.35). He then had to affix the garland. After inserting a number of hooks the plaintiff would descend the ladder and move it along the ground in the direction in which he was working. He would then ascend the ladder in order to place the hooks into the awning. To reach full stretch he could use only one side of his body. He was using one hand to clip the hook in. He would use either his right or left hand to position the hooks depending how far along the stepped awning he could reach.” 
         
        
        
       As to the findings numbered 59 and 60, she said in para [43]: 
        
        
         
         “Just prior to falling the plaintiff was standing on the second top step of the ladder. The top of the ladder connected with the bottom of his shin. He can remember reaching out but cannot recall whether or not he put the hook in the slotted part (T31). The plaintiff has no recollection of his fall or lying on the ground. His next recollection is being in hospital.” 
          
         
        
        
       As to the finding numbered 74, she said in para [71] “the plaintiff was trying to meet the deadline”.  
        
       
     33 In my opinion there are only two parts of these statements which can be enlisted to support the proposition for which the plaintiff contends. The first is the statement in para [42] that after inserting “a number of hooks” the plaintiff would descend the ladder and move it, before ascending the ladder in order to place the “hooks into the awning”. The second is the statement in para [43] that the plaintiff “can remember reaching out.”  
      
       
     34 In these passages the Master was not making findings. She was purporting to do no more than summarise the plaintiff’s evidence. It is true both that the Master did not reject the plaintiff’s evidence in terms, and that the Master took the approach that where the plaintiff’s evidence “is not corroborated I examined his evidence very carefully”. The only actual findings she made were four in number – that the plaintiff reached “overhead and outwards at full stretch” (para [50]), that the plaintiff had been reaching “overhead to a full stretch outside the style area of the ladder” (para [62]), that the plaintiff “overreached” (para [64]) and that the defendant “would have expected that the experienced plaintiff would have known to … move the ladder more regularly (para [65]). The first three findings are findings challenged by the defendant. Curiously, the plaintiff does not rely on the fourth finding in support of the first three: yet that finding indicates that the Master must have thought that the plaintiff was putting up at least two hooks each time the plaintiff went up the ladder, since if he was only putting one up, there would be no point in moving the ladder more regularly. A similar assumption underlies the first sentence in paragraph [63]. 
      
       
     35 The answer to the question whether the Master made a finding about any practice of the plaintiff’s of putting up three hooks at a time is that apart from what the Master said in paras [63] and [65] about moving the ladder more frequently or regularly, she made no findings to that effect and no findings capable of supporting conclusions to that effect. Further, what she said in para [65] is compatible with no more than two hooks being put up at each positioning of the ladder.  
      
       
        
       Was there evidence to support the proposition that the plaintiff put up three hooks at each positioning of the ladder? 
        
       
     36 The next question is whether there was evidence to support the plaintiff’s contention that three hooks were inserted on each occasion. The Master’s summary of the plaintiff’s evidence in para [43] as being to the effect that he “can remember reaching out” goes beyond his testimony. He did not say he reached out. His evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “I remember reaching and that’s all, I can’t remember if I got the hook in or if I didn’t get a hook in.” 
         
        
        
       That is equally compatible with reaching up as it is with reaching out. The plaintiff on this appeal relies on what appears at T29. The relevant part of that material is: 
        
        
         
         “Q. In order to reach up to the top level for example that is the roof level, where did you have to stand? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I had to stand, the second top step where you have the total top step and there is a small rung underneath, I had to position myself there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you use the ladder to affix the hooks? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were fixing the hooks and standing in that position did you have to reach up? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How high? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was at a stretch, full stretch. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are indicating sitting in the witness box lifting a hand up? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did you do with the other hand? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I couldn’t reach the ceiling, I had to sort of lean to do it, you know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say lean which way did you lean? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To get to ultimate height you can only really use one side of your body. I was just using one hand to clip it in because you could clip it in with one hand, it didn’t need two hands to do it. 
         
        
        
         
         MASTER: Q. Which hand were you using, your left hand, can you remember? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To be perfectly honest I can’t exactly remember which hand it was. 
         
        
        
         
         CRANITCH: Q. Would you use the right or left depending where you had to position the screws? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Depending how far along I got. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How many screws did you have to put up, do you remember? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         MASTER: Q. Were they hooks or screws? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Hooks. 
         
        
        
         
         CRANITCH: Q. On the lower part of the awning where the step appears on the photograph which you have marked did you have to stretch far? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, no.” 
         
        
        
       The plaintiff then described the moments before the fall thus: 
        
        
         
         “Q. Do you recall putting any hooks into the ceiling on that occasion? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t recall that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What do you last recall? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I remember reaching and that’s all, I can’t remember if I got the hook in or if I didn’t get a hook in.” 
         
        
        
       That material does not support any conclusion that the plaintiff was reaching out – only that he was reaching up and, in a fashion not made clear in chief, he found that he “had to sort of lean to do it, you know”. The plaintiff made it clearer in cross-examination what he meant: 
        
        
         
         “Q. You told us yesterday that you could recall reaching. You remember saying that yesterday? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall telling us yesterday that you remember that you had to lean in the sense that when you reached your body tilted to one side in some fashion? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes because when you raise one arm your body tilts.” 
         
        
        
       That type of leaning or tilting is not the type of leaning that must be done if hooks are inserted to the left or right, as distinct from straight above.  
        
       
     37 So far as the Master in para [42] referred to the placing by the plaintiff of a “number of hooks” at each place the ladder was moved to, nothing on T29 suggests that he placed more than one hook at each place the ladder rested. On that page the questioner referred to hooks (or “screws”, meaning hooks) on four occasions, but in a manner equally compatible with a general description of the totality of the operation. The plaintiff never gave specific evidence that at each place the ladder rested he inserted more than one hook. He was asked only one question which might have elicited such an answer, but it did not. The question, already quoted, related to his activities just before he fell: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you recall putting any hooks into the ceiling on that occasion? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t recall that.” 
         
        
       
     38 Accordingly, there was no evidence given by the plaintiff to support the proposition that he inserted, on each occasion, a hook to the left, a hook to the right, and a hook above him. Nor was there any other evidence to support it. Nor was there any evidence that he inserted two hooks on each occasion. There was no evidence given by the plaintiff to support the conclusion that he fell in the act of reaching “outwards at full stretch”, or even overhead at full stretch – save from what could be inferred from his evidence about his ordinary practice. His evidence about his ordinary practice was not that he ever reached outwards and sideways. His evidence about his ordinary practice was that he reached upwards with one arm, thereby causing a tilt in his body. In those circumstances there is no significance in the fact that the plaintiff was not cross-examined on the relevant evidence, save to clarify the words “I had to sort of lean to do it, you know”. Nor is there any significance in the defendant’s failure to call Mr Smink, since the plaintiff’s evidence did not suggest any possible inferences which Mr Smink’s silence permitted the Master to draw more strongly. But despite the lack of direct evidence for the proposition that the plaintiff ever reached outwards, for reasons to be seen the Master’s view that this is what caused the fall is probably to be accepted.  
      
       
        
       Another factual question: means of stabilising the plaintiff 
        
       
     39 It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that in the position from which he fell “he had no means of stabilising himself beyond pressing his lower shins against the top step of the ladder”. The defendant denied this. For the defendant it was submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “the learned Master found that the claimant ‘could have easily requested an employee (Smink) to hold the ladder for him so that it was more stable’ (para 62). Further, she found that ‘if the ladder had been properly held, there was no reason why the work could not be safely done … the plaintiff should have taken the precaution of having someone hold the ladder’ (para 71); she also found he could have moved the ladder to minimise the need to reach (para 63).” 
         
        
        
       The defendant’s arguments on this point are correct. 
        
        
       A further factual question: the role of time pressures 
        
       
     40 It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that while working before he fell, he “was under time pressures”. The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “no finding was made by the learned Master to the effect that time pressures were in any way relevant to, or causative of, the appellant’s fall; in fact, she found to the contrary. She accepted that the plaintiff was under time constraints (para 62) but ‘could have moved the ladder in the direction he was working on a more frequent basis thus minimising the area of his reach. Although it may have taken more time’ (inferentially, it was open to him to do so), ‘this is exactly the mode which Tim Clarkson adopted when he completed the job later that day’ (para 63).” 
         
        
        
       This contention of the defendant also appears to be sound. The job had to be finished that day, but there is no evidence of any pressure from the defendant on the plaintiff to complete particular operations within particular times. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that it could be inferred that the plaintiff felt under pressure to work hastily because Dr Adams said: “it is reasonable to infer that [the plaintiff] would have been attempting to attach as many as three hooks in a row from the one ladder location”. This was not objected to, but it is of questionable admissibility and no weight. As indicated above, the Master made no finding to the effect of Dr Adams’ opinion, and there was no evidence to support it. Accordingly no inference of haste can be drawn from it.  
        
        
       The significance of Tim Clarkson’s evidence 
        
       
     41 Tim and Michael Clarkson were the principals of the defendant. The Master said in para [54]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Tim Clarkson and the plaintiff are about the same height and same build. Later on that day after the accident occurred, Tim Clarkson took over the plaintiff’s position. Tim Clarkson used the same ladder to complete affixing the garland. He described the ladder as a solid and very stable ladder. He said that although he cannot recollect which rung his feet were on, he was at a safe level. He raised his hands over his head. His arms were extended, his elbows were bent and his hands were about one foot above the top of his head (T344). Tim got down and moved the ladder and went up again until the hanging garland on the awning had been completed. He did not experience any sensation of the ladder being unstable. Nor did he find it necessary to request an employee hold the ladder to ensure his safety.” 
         
        
       
     42 The Master then said in para [63]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Alternatively the plaintiff could have moved the ladder in the direction he was working on a more frequent basis thus minimising the area of his reach. Although it may have taken more time he would not be called upon to reach outside the centre of his mass and he would have been securely balanced. This is exactly the mode which Tim Clarkson adopted when he completed the job later that day.” 
         
        
        
       What was Tim Clarkson’s evidence about the mode he adopted? 
        
       
     43 In chief he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The completion of the external decorations, that is the area at which you saw this garland hanging down, you personally physically completed that work? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you do it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. With the assistance, my recollection is a bit sketchy. It was the same casual help Ben had, I believe it is Yoris. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you get the ladder that had been moved? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I got the ladder and used the same equipment. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you put it back in the area where [the] garland was hanging down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, in the same position.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you get up the ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, to complete the job. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you got up on the ladder, there was nothing about the stability of the ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, it was very stable. It was a solid ladder, very stable. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you climbed the ladder, did you do so one foot at a time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. That is how I usually climb a ladder. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Sorry, if some of these questions were not lucid. There is a purpose for that. Are you about the same height as Ben Van-der Sluice? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I might be a bit taller. I think we are very much the same build and whatever he is. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You got the ladder to the position where the garland was hanging down, did you continue the installation? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I completed that whole work with the garland. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you got to the point where the work had stopped -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I think we can take it was the point Ben fell? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How high up the ladder did you go in order to reach the garland so you could continue the work? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The exact ladder, the rung that I was on I can’t recollect.” 
         
        
        
       This evidence makes it difficult to conclude that he was on the second step from the top, as the plaintiff said that he for his part had been.  
        
       
     44 The evidence continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Can you remember where, if at all, the top of the ladder came to you on your legs? 
         
        
        
         
         MASTER: Q. Or body? 
         
        
        
         
         MACONACHIE: Q. Or body when you undertook the work of hanging the garland? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
       Though that evidence, if correctly recorded, was not an answer to the question, the question was not repeated.  
        
       
     45 The evidence continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Was it necessary for you to raise your hands above your head? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How far above your head, can you remember? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was working at this type of height really. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You demonstrate with your arms extended, but your elbows bent, with your hands about a foot above the top of your head? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I’d say that would be about right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You do so with both of your hands extended in that fashion above your head, correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it necessary to do it with two hands above your head? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes well, the hook was put in which was, sort of, one hand and the garland was put up, you know, holding it with two hands at the front to put it into the hole that was in that hook. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you progressively insert hooks into the position that is, in the position required and attach the garland? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, spaced evenly. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At what centres were the hooks placed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I cannot recall. I mean as a rule over 500 and 700 mms to make sure the garland is kept flush. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you progress the work? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Work was progressed fine, I mean -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you do so by staying in the one place or did you have to get down and move the ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, had to move the ladder. And that is with the assistance of the casual came in. He helped pass the garland up and we did one spot. And then, once we couldn’t reach the next fixing point, we then come down, move the ladder and went up again. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That process continued until you hung the garland along the awning? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As you progressed the job, did you have any sensation of the instability of the ladder at all? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         MASTER: Q. Was anyone holding the ladder? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
        
       The fourth last answer is capable of being read as supporting the Master’s implication in para [63] that Tim Clarkson applied only one hook at each positioning of the ladder. There was no attempt to challenge that answer in cross-examination.  
        
       
     46 However, so far as there was precision in the evidence in chief in any other respect, it was undercut by the following evidence in cross-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You described reaching up with both hands. My learned friend suggests like this you have reached up to get to the top part of the arc? 
         
        
        
         
         A. To be honest, I can’t exactly remember that. I remember I completed the job and that was it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It would be fair to say you cannot recall how far up you reached or where you were standing on the ladder, which rung you were standing on? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I did not realise what step I was on.” 
         
        
       
     47 The Master appears to have preferred the precision of the evidence in chief to the want of recollection in cross-examination. None of the conventional bases on which a finding of primary fact by a trier of fact who heard and saw a witness can be interfered with by this Court would appear to apply to invalidate the Master’s finding in para [54].  
      
       
     48 However, if the finding were to be set aside because of the answer in cross-examination, the position is as follows. It is a reasonable inference from the evidence of Tim Clarkson that he inserted one hook at each positioning of the ladder. There is no evidence that he moved his body mass outside the stile area. What is quite unclear is what rung he stood on. However, Dr Adams’ reasoning did not depend on whether a user of the ladder stood on the second top step or the fourth top step. If his arms were fully extended above his head and the plaintiff’s were too, and if the plaintiff is correct that he was on the second top step, Tim Clarkson must have been too. It is possible, however, that Tim Clarkson’s arms were only partly extended, as he said in chief: in that event either the plaintiff must have been mistaken about stretching up (if both were on the second step) or the plaintiff must have been mistaken about being on the second step. It was put to him in cross-examination that he was on the fourth step, but he denied it.  
      
       
     49 The problem with the Master’s use of Tim Clarkson’s conduct as a means of criticising what the plaintiff did is that Tim Clarkson’s evidence did not make it clear what he did. Though it is capable of being read as suggesting that Tim Clarkson placed only one hook for each positioning of the ladder, taken as a whole it is not clear where he was on the ladder or how far he reached over his head. A further difficulty is that it may not be safe to compare Tim Clarkson’s safe completion of the job with the plaintiff’s experience, because, following the accident which befell the plaintiff, Tim Clarkson would be likely to have been very careful in avoiding any unnecessary risk. In circumstances where there is not much evidence of what the plaintiff did and less of what Tim Clarkson did, the Master’s recourse to Tim Clarkson’s evidence is not a strong support for her reasoning. 
      
       
     50 There is, however, some negative support for the Master’s conclusions to be drawn from Tim Clarkson’s evidence. If (contrary to Dr Adams’ opinion, which was that it did not matter whether the plaintiff was on the second, third or fourth step) it was crucial to the plaintiff’s case that he was obliged to work on the second step and that this created an inherently dangerous position, that case is not supported by any admission extracted by counsel for the plaintiff, who bore the burden of proof, in cross-examination of Tim Clarkson: he was not asked any question about whether it was essential to work from the second step. And, whether Tim Clarkson was behaving excessively cautiously or not, he was not cross-examined to suggest that he was, and he did complete the work without experiencing instability or suffering a mishap. If Tim Clarkson did the work without mishap, without the ladder being held and without sideways leaning, and the plaintiff did the work without the ladder being held and with sideways leaning, the cause of the plaintiff’s mishap was likely to be the sideways leaning. Since by the end of the argument the defendant was contending (contrary to its written submissions) that the sideways leaning view was justifiable, and the plaintiff did not withdraw its written submissions that it was justifiable, it is difficult for this Court to conclude definitively that there was no sideways leaning. The plaintiff unquestionably fell, and sideways leaning appears to be the only available explanation for the fall. All others have been eliminated or lack evidentiary support. In particular, the Master excluded epilepsy and moisture on the ground, and did not find that the ground was uneven or that the ladder moved. There is no evidence of unevenness and no evidence that the ladder moved as a result of unevenness.  
      
       
     51 However, in view of these difficulties to do with the Master’s use of Tim Clarkson’s evidence, the safest course is to leave it out of account in evaluating the overall merits of the Master’s reasoning. 
      
       
        
       Ground 13: the contract ground 
        
       
     52 This ground was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master having found (para [28]) that there was an implied term of the Appellant’s contract that the Respondent ‘would take reasonable care not to injure the plaintiff’ erred in rejecting (RAB 80) the Appellant’s claim (RAB 3,4) for breach of that contractual term, having regard to her factual findings.” 
         
        
       
     53 This was a ground added pursuant to leave, to which the defendant consented. It was the ground argued first in oral argument. Counsel for the plaintiff advanced the contract argument as a means of overcoming the risk of any reduction in damages payable to the plaintiff by reason of the plaintiff’s own contributory negligence. Counsel accepted that the contractual standard of care was the same as the tortious standard of care. Counsel for the defendant, who was highly critical of the way in which the contract argument was deployed in the appeal, nonetheless unsurprisingly agreed that if the defendant was not liable in tort, it was not liable in contract either. It follows that if the plaintiff fails in contending that the defendant was in breach of its duty of care imposed by the law of tort, he must equally fail in contract. It is therefore not necessary to go further into the details of the contract argument.  
      
       
        
       Ground 1: was the plaintiff an independent contractor? 
        
       
     54 This ground was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in concluding (para 32) that the Claimant was an independent contractor.  
         
        
        
         
         (a) having regard to her findings of objective fact (paras 30, 31) 
         
        
        
         
         (b) in reaching that conclusion by relying upon the subjective belief of the parties (para 32) 
         
        
        
         
         (c) in reaching that conclusion by relying upon the parties’ belief as to the legal obligations, which legal obligations are consequences which follow from but do not define their relationship.” 
         
        
       
     55 Counsel for the defendant contended that the standard of care owed to the plaintiff was lower if he was an independent contractor than it was if he was an employee. The defendant accordingly supported the Master’s conclusion on this question. Counsel for the plaintiff also noted that in some respects the plaintiff’s position would be better if he were an independent contractor because of statutory caps on recovery by employees.  
      
       
     56 It is not necessary to consider the detailed arguments which the plaintiff advanced on this question, because it was not shown that a characterisation of the relationship as one of employment would have led to any different result before the Master, or would lead to any different result in this Court. If the Master’s reasoning in paras [62]-[66] of her reasons for judgment is sound, it would prevent the plaintiff recovering even if he had been an employee. And if the plaintiff’s attacks on that reasoning are sound, the plaintiff would recover even though he was an independent contractor.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 2 and 3: foreseeability 
        
       
     57 Ground 2 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in determining (para 65) that the Opponent (c)ould not have foreseen that there was a risk of injury to the Claimant involved in installation of decorations by means of a ladder 
         
        
        
         
         (a) generally, and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) having found 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) ‘ 
           In the case before me, there was a risk arising from the nature of the work and there was some need for coordination by the defendant’ (para 34).  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) ‘ 
           It may be accepted that a risk of injury attaches in respect of any person who had to go on to work at height in order to install Christmas decorations. It follows from the circumstances that such a person is expected to work at a height as (scil. ‘such that’) he had to use a ladder.’ (para 51) and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) ‘ 
            … a mobile scaffolding platform would have been a very cheap and practical response to the foreseeable risk.’ (para 69).” 
           
          
         
        
       
     58 Ground 3 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in holding (para 65) that it was not foreseeable that the Claimant, having the overall obligation of completing the hanging of Christmas decorations, and under pressure of time, might risk injury by reaching from the top of the ladder to each side to install three hooks, rather than relocating the ladder for the fixing of each hook.” 
         
        
       
     59 The plaintiff’s written submission in support of these grounds was brief: 
      
       
        
         
         “The finding (para 65) that the Respondent would not have foreseen risk of injury to the Appellant in the factual circumstances found is unsustainable. Even putting aside the obvious likelihood that the Appellant in circumstances of time pressure might reach from the top of the ladder to left and to right in order to save time, that which was directly contemplated by the Respondent involved the Appellant working at such a height as to pose an obvious risk that he might fall, as indeed he did. The learned Master has misunderstood the low threshold involved in foreseeability. Her findings of fact, quoted in ground 2, are at variance with her finding of an absence of foreseeability.” 
         
        
        
        
       The defendant’s arguments on grounds 2 and 3 
        
       
     60 The defendant argued: 
      
       
        
         
         “At the trial, foreseeability in the breach sense was not in issue. The learned Master’s reference to foreseeability must be understood in that context. Principally, her references to foreseeability are at para 52 and para 65. The manner in which it is dealt with at para 65 by the learned Master demonstrates the sense in which she used the word or words. The notion that the learned Master was plainly attempting to convey was that the simple uncomplicated task which the claimant was contracted to undertake, and in respect of which he was experienced and known to be competent, did not involve any real risk of injury if ordinary care was exercised (see  
         O’Connor v Commissioner for Government Transport 
          100 CLR 225). It is conceptually the same as the reasoning of Taylor J in  
         Smith v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited 
          (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 343.8. 
         
        
        
         
         That is plainly the way in which the learned Master used the expression criticised; that is made plain by the words in para 65 of her judgment: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The defendant would have expected that the experienced plaintiff would have known to either move the ladder more regularly or would have directed an employee of the defendant to hold the ladder steady.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In any event, no relevant error is demonstrated because the learned Master decided the case against the appellant on the reasonableness and causation issues.” 
         
        
       
     61 In Smith’s case an employee was injured when he and another employee called Woods threw a wooden packing case weighing 100 pounds from a roof: a projection on the case caught in the employee’s glove and dragged him off the roof. At 343-4 Taylor J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Upon the evidence the explanation of the mishap is to be found in the fact that, with full knowledge that there were nails protruding from the surface of the box, the appellant and Woods proceeded to launch the case into space after preliminaries that were quite unnecessary but which were calculated to give to the case considerable impetus and, at the same time, to introduce some degree of risk. I confess that I am unable to see that any such risk was involved in the task which they were asked to perform provided that it was performed, as it should have been, in a reasonably sensible and careful manner. There was not the slightest reason for employing the extraordinary procedure which was employed nor, it should be said, why the foreman should for a moment have contemplated that it would be employed. In effect it may, therefore, be concluded that the task assigned to the appellant and Woods did not involve any real risk of injury even if carried out with some reasonably foreseeable degree of inadvertence or thoughtlessness; the accident occurred because of the quite extraordinary and unnecessary method in which the two employees proceeded to carry out a perfectly simple task.” 
         
        
       
     62 In O’Connor v Commissioner of Government Transport (1954) 100 CLR 225 an experienced plumber employed by the defendant fell through an awning which was affected by dry rot. Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ said at 229-30: 
      
       
        
         
         “This conclusion seems inevitable. The defendant as employer was of course under a duty, by his servants and agents, to take reasonable care for the safety of the deceased by providing proper and adequate means of carrying out his work without unnecessary risk, by warning him of unusual or unexpected risks, and by instructing him in the performance of his work where instructions might reasonably be thought to be required to secure him from danger of injury. 
         
        
        
         
         But the party was provided with trestles and plank and nothing was wanting in tools or equipment. The deceased was experienced in his work. It was obvious that a question must exist whether the awning would bear his weight. The party sent down was as ‘expert’ or competent to judge of that simple subject as anybody that could reasonably be sent. Doubtless Blyton, who told the deceased to go, thought that he would work on the roof, but it was left to the deceased and the rest of the party to do the job as they thought fit. Blyton was only the leading plumber and when he sent the deceased as the next man he was not directing him how he must perform the work. It simply meant that it was what he himself would do, and without further thought he spoke accordingly. In such a simple matter who else should be left to judge? Does the reasonable care demanded of the employer require him to cause a scientific or other elaborate examination to be made of the strength of the structure lest the working plumber may decide to trust himself to it rather than work from a plank or trestles? If, as the jury may be taken to have found, the dry rot was the cause of the awning failing under the deceased’s weight, the presence of the dry rot was as easily ascertained by the deceased as by anybody however skilled. The standard of care for an employee’s safety is not a low one, but in a case such as this the question must be whether any suggested course that was omitted could really be regarded as reasonable. The case is not one of a defect in premises provided by the employer as the place where the employee is to do his work. The awning was the very thing to be worked at. There were the means at hand of doing the work required without mounting the structure. It was an ordinary question for a plumber to decide for himself how he would do the work. Obviously any experienced plumber would see that there must be a question whether a structure like the awning supported not by posts but by brackets was strong enough to bear his weight as he dismantled it. It was not made for that purpose and neither the deceased nor any of his companions can be supposed to have thought that it had been specially tested to see if it was strong enough. It seems fanciful to treat the question as one to be gone into and decided by some superior officer, as distinguished from the workmen on the spot, and still more fanciful to suppose that a warning or special instruction was demanded about so simple and obvious a matter requiring neither special skill or knowledge to decide and ordinarily treated as a matter for the man doing the job.”  
         
        
       
     63 Of these two cases, Glass, McHugh and Douglas, The Liability of Employees in Damages for Personal Injury (2nd ed 1979) pp 45-6 said that they laid down: 
      
       
        
         
         “an important principle in limitation of the employer’s liability. … 
         
        
        
         
         An area is marked out within which the employer’s duty to provide a safe system of work is inoperative. It would appear that the immunity of the employer will be limited to isolated operations of no complexity outside the normal system or simple uncomplicated operations within it. It is not likely that the principle will undergo much further elucidation as scope for its operation is essentially a matter of degree depending upon the nature of the industrial activity. The only unifying principle available is the power of the court to hold that on the evidence in the particular case it would be beyond all reason to find an employer in breach of duty for failure to take certain specified steps. The impossibility of further definition is due not only to the inutility of classifying industrial tasks, but also the fact that what can reasonably be expected of industry by way of safety precautions is a developing concept.” 
         
        
        
       Conclusion in relation to the plaintiff’s submissions 
        
       
     64 In evaluating the plaintiff’s submission set out above, it is necessary, as the submission contemplates, to put aside “the obvious likelihood that [he] in circumstances of time pressure might reach from the top of the ladder to left and to right in order to save time”. That must be done for the reasons set out above. There was no evidence or finding that time pressure was affecting the precise way the plaintiff was operating. That leaves three points in the plaintiff’s submissions. 
      
       
     65 The first is that the defendant put the plaintiff in a position of working at such a height as to pose an obvious risk of falling. In my opinion the risk was, for persons experienced in that type of work, far from obvious. It does not follow from the fact that Mr Smink thought it dangerous to ascend the ladder that there was an obvious risk for the plaintiff in doing so. 
      
       
     66 The plaintiff’s second point was that there is a low threshold involved in foreseeability and that the Master misunderstood this. The defendant referred to Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40; Nagle v Rotnest Island Authority (1993) 177 CLR 423; Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre v Anzil (2000) 75 ALJR 164. It is true that Glass JA in the Court of Appeal in Shirt v Wyong Shire Council [1978] 1 NSWLR 631 at 641 famously described foreseeability as an “undemanding” test. In many areas it may be, at least as the law stands now. But it has a different and more demanding operation where simple uncomplicated operations by an employee within the normal system of work are concerned, for the reasons explained in Smith’s case, O’Connor’s case and Glass JA’s book. The position cannot be different for independent contractors: Stevens v Brodribb Saw Milling Co Pty Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 16 at 31. The authorities relied on by the plaintiff deal with areas distinct from the question whether a system of work in which an experienced plaintiff is operating is safe.  
      
       
     67 The third point made by the plaintiff is that the findings of fact referred to in Ground 2 contradict the Master’s conclusion that there was no foreseeability.  
      
       
     68 The first of the allegedly contradictory findings of fact was, in para [34], expressed thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “there was a risk arising from the nature of the work and there was some need for co-ordination by the defendant in relation to the delivery of the decorations.” 
         
        
        
       This statement was made in answer to an attempt by the defendant to distinguish a passage in  
       Stevens v Brodribb Saw Milling Co Pty Ltd 
        (1986) 160 CLR 16 at 31, where Mason J said that an entrepreneur owed a duty to prescribe a safe system of work whether or not those he engaged were independent contractors or employees. Mason J spoke of where there was a “risk … of injury arising from the nature of work”, and of a need for coordination. The injury here did not flow from any problem about coordination of work in erecting decorations as distinct from delivering them. The fact that there was said by the Master to be a risk of injury to persons generally does not contradict her conclusion that the injury to the plaintiff on the ladder was not reasonably foreseeable. The plaintiff’s submission also overlooks the fact that immediately after the passage relied on the Master said of the case before her: “But the activities [were] not interdependent as in  
       Brodribb 
       .” 
        
       
     69 The second passage on which the plaintiff relies as contradicting the finding on foreseeability is at para [51]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It may be accepted that a risk of injury attaches in respect of any person who had to go on to work at height in order to install Christmas decorations. It follows from the circumstances that such a person is expected to work at a height [such that] he had to use a ladder.” 
         
        
        
       The whole paragraph reads: 
        
        
         
         “So far as these particulars relate to fault directly attributable to the defendant they depend upon there having been a personal duty of care reposed in it to exercise reasonable care to protect the plaintiff from foreseeable risk of injury, which called on it to ensure that they took adequate precautions for the plaintiff’s safety while he carried out his visual display work. It may be accepted that a risk of injury attaches in respect of any person who had to go on to work at height in order to install Christmas decorations. It follows from the circumstances that such a person is expected to work at a height [such that] he had to use a ladder. For the security and soundness of the ladder he had to rely upon the defendant.” 
         
        
        
       The Master’s point was simply that among the precautions which the defendant had to take was the provision of a secure and sound ladder. The plaintiff’s case does not allege that the actual ladder was insecure and unsound. Further, the Master’s statement that there was a “risk” arising for “any person” is not inconsistent with her conclusion that it was not a reasonably foreseeable risk so far as the plaintiff was concerned. 
        
       
     70 The third allegedly contradictory passage relied upon by the plaintiff is from para [69]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is my view that a mobile scaffolding platform would have been a cheap and practical response to the foreseeable risk.” 
         
        
        
       As counsel for the plaintiff accepted in oral argument to this Court, this is scarcely contradictory of the Master’s finding that there was no reasonably foreseeable risk. What is said in para [69] appears after the Master said she rejected the plaintiff’s case. It is part of the Master’s provisional findings against the possibility that her reasoning leading to the decision to direct a verdict for the defendant was wrong. What is said in para [69] assumes that the findings on reasonable foreseeability in para [65] are wrong, but does not accept that they are wrong.  
        
       
     71 In oral argument counsel for the plaintiff put the plaintiff’s case in the following forceful way: 
      
       
        
         
         “if a man is standing half way up a ladder then of course he has the benefit of hand holds, mainly the rest of the ladder. If he is standing at the top of a ladder which is leaning against a wall then he presumably may get some hand holds on the wall or some part of the structure but when he’s got a ladder that’s standing out in the open like a pyramid and he’s perched at the top of it and he has no point of stability beyond such as may be obtained by resting his shins against the top of the ladder we would say that it is plainly reasonably foreseeable that he’s at risk of falling off and seriously damaging himself.” 
         
        
       
     72 The answer to this argument is that while it may be reasonably foreseeable that many men in that position would fall off, the plaintiff was a skilled workman experienced in this type of repetitive work. In 1993 the plaintiff had set up a freelance decorating business, and most of the work it did was for the defendant. From 1993 to 1996 the plaintiff had done freelance work for the defendant on an extensive basis – as he said in chief, it was “a fairly long association”. The September-February period each year was very busy, but not the rest of the year. The plaintiff had worked at the Imperial Arcade for the defendant two years before the accident. In September-October 1996 the officers of the defendant went to some trouble to secure the plaintiff’s services. Not only had the plaintiff done work of this kind before for years without mishap, he had done it on that earlier occasion at the Imperial Arcade, and he did it on this occasion without mishap until he fell. The defendant could not reasonably foresee that he would fall, because the defendant was entitled to assume that he would identify any risk of falling and take measures to prevent that risk from arising if he did. For the defendant it was not reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would come to harm because of the skill it had detected in him during their earlier association – which skill the defendant had gone to considerable lengths to acquire on this occasion - and because of his experience, and hence his capacity to perceive any possible risks and his capacity to devise methods of negating them by not leaning too far to the right or left, moving the ladder appropriately, and having it held by Mr Smink or someone else if necessary.  
      
       
     73 Notwithstanding the risks as described in the argument of counsel for the plaintiff, the Master did find that any risk could have been acceptably obviated by asking another person to hold the ladder (which the plaintiff did not do) or moving it more frequently. Counsel for the plaintiff challenged the conclusion that the plaintiff did not give that direction, but it was a reasonable inference from the fact that no-one was in fact holding the ladder. Counsel for the plaintiff did not challenge the balance of the Master’s reasoning on this point. 
      
       
     74 A primary difficulty in the plaintiff’s position goes beyond the fact that he ought to have perceived the dangers in working very high on the ladder because of his experience in that type of work and on the very site of his injury, and beyond the fact that it would have been reasonable for the defendant to assume that he, as a skilled and experienced contractor in that line of work, would have perceived and guarded against those dangers. The fact that the higher up a ladder one moves the more care one must take for one’s own safety is one of those simple facts affecting human existence in the physical world which adults in industrialised societies have learned by the time, or indeed well before the time, they have become adults. It is a fact as fundamental, as elementary, as clear and as well known as, for example, the fact that it is dangerous to behave boisterously near pots cooking on stoves, the fact that broken glass needs to be carefully handled when picked up, the fact that rocks along the seashore can be slippery, the fact that shells in the sand of beaches can be sharp, and the fact that when moving about rubbish dumps one must bear in mind the possibility that rubbish may be lying there. These are matters which no adult need be told about and which any adult can be trusted to guard against the dangers of because it is part of the equipment of all normal adult human beings. All citizens can safely and reasonably assume that each normal adult human being acting autonomously and voluntarily will not incur unnecessary and blatantly obvious risks. The assessment of risk in those areas is for the judgment of each normal adult in the light of the particular adult’s capacity. Mr Smink felt that for him it was risky to climb the ladder. The plaintiff did not. But Mr Smink was a backpacker from Holland working in Australia, not a skilled and experienced specialist. In view of the interposition of the judgment of the workmen between the task which the defendant had engaged them for and any risk of injury, the risk of injury was not reasonably foreseeable.  
      
       
     75 Grounds 2 and 3 fail. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 4 and 5: breach of duty of care 
        
       
     76 Ground 4 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in defining the scope of the duty owed by the Opponent to the Claimant (para 65) in terms only of the hypothetical expectations of the Opponent as to the Claimant’s conduct 
         
        
        
         
         (a) generally, and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) without adverting to her findings that 
         
        
       
     · ‘the plaintiff was under time constraints and (had) the responsibility to ensure that the job was completed by the end of the day’ (para 62) 
      
       
     · ‘the plaintiff was working to a height 4.8 metres from the ground’ (para 53) 
      
       
     · ‘the plaintiff fell because he was standing on the second top step of the ladder while reaching overhead and outwards at full stretch to put a hook in the slotted part of the awning. He overbalanced.’ (para 50)” 
      
       
        
       Ground 5 is: 
        
        
         
         “The learned Master erred in that, having found (paras 34 and 51) the Opponent owed the Claimant a duty to take reasonable care for his safety she did not define the scope of that duty (see para 52), and held (para 65) without reasons or without adequate reasons that the Opponent did not breach that duty of care.” 
         
        
       
     77 The plaintiff submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned Master appears to have accepted that much the same duty existed between the parties whether the relationship was one of employee or independent contractor – paragraphs 33 and 34. She found that the Respondent had a legal obligation to provide the Appellant with a safe system of work. Insofar as the Master dealt with content of that duty, she found 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘a personal duty of care reposed in it to exercise reasonable care to protect the plaintiff from foreseeable risk of injury, which called on it to ensure that they took adequate precautions for the plaintiff’s safety while he carried out his … work’ (para 51). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The learned Master went on 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘in the case of skilled independent contractors … the defendant would not foresee or if they did foresee would not think it reasonably necessary to guard against the occurrence of those injuries (sic, scil. ‘risks’) which are ordinary incidents of the work’ (para 52). 
            
           
          
         While no exception could be taken to the former statement (substituting ‘reasonable’ for ‘adequate’), it is submitted that the finding that risk of the kind here relevant are not foreseeable, or if foreseeable, not reasonably necessary to guard against, is unsustainable. 
         
        
        
         
         The learned Master found 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would not have foreseen that there was a risk of injury to the plaintiff … the defendant would have expected that the experienced plaintiff would have known to either move the ladder more regularly or would have directed an employee of the defendant to hold the ladder steady. Accordingly as the defendant did not breach the duty of care it owed to the plaintiff the plaintiff’s claim in negligence fails’ (para 65). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the learned Master has conflated questions of foreseeability and breach of duty. Her finding of absence of foreseeability is the subject of grounds 2 and 3. As to breach of duty of care, it is submitted that a proper analysis of the issues involved would have identified an obligation on the part of the Respondent to take reasonable care to avoid harm to the Appellant from dangers of which it was aware or ought to have been aware. The scope of that duty would include the provision of a safe base from which to carry out work. 
         
        
        
         
         Had the learned Master correctly identified the relevant duty, it is submitted that the factual findings she made demonstrate that a breach of that duty, causally connected with the Appellant’s injuries, had been established. 
         
        
        
         
         The factual findings made by the learned Master include 
         
        
       
     · There was a risk arising from the nature of the work and there was some need for co-ordination by the defendant (para 34). 
      
       
     · The relevant ladder was a 12 foot aluminium ladder with steps on one side which belonged to the defendant (para 40). 
      
       
     · To perform the task hooks were required to be inserted (para 41). 
      
       
     · To carry out the work the plaintiff placed his feet on the next rung down from the top, reaching up full stretch with one arm and leaning forward (42). 
      
       
     · After inserting a number of hooks the plaintiff would descend the ladder and move it (42). 
      
       
     · To reach full stretch he could only use one side of his body, using one hand to clip the hook in (42).  
      
       
     · The plaintiff fell because he was standing on the second top step of the ladder while reaching overhead and outwards at full stretch to put a hook in… He overbalanced and fell (50). 
      
       
     · The plaintiff had been working to a height of 4.8m from the ground (53). 
      
       
     · The plaintiff was working under some considerable time pressure (58, 62). 
      
       
     · [The] plaintiff had been provided with an unskilled inexperienced work team (58). 
      
       
     · [The] plaintiff had the responsibility to ensure the job was completed by the end of the day (62). 
      
       
     · The plaintiff, in a precarious position, overreached (64). 
      
       
     · A mobile scaffolding platform would have been a cheap and practical response to the foreseeable risk (69). 
      
       
     · No conduct on the part of the plaintiff makes him at all responsible for the damage in the sense that he departed from the standard of care of the reasonable man (70).  
      
       
     · The plaintiff was trying to meet the deadline (71).” 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     78 So far as these submissions overlap with those advanced in relation to Grounds 2 and 3 (foreseeability), they fail for the same reasons. 
      
       
     79 So far as the submissions contend that there was no proper analysis of the issues involved in relation to breach of a duty of care, they rest on what Kirby J said in Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (1998) 192 CLR 431 at [115]. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “These proceedings therefore fall to be determined by the application of the tests accepted in  
         Nagle 
         . The way in which this Court approached the problem in  
         Nagle 
          provides a model for the way in which similar problems should be addressed in future cases where, as seems inevitable, claims by injured persons will be brought against local and other public authorities seeking damages in negligence. Unless particular issues are conceded, it is highly desirable that trial courts should approach such disputes by considering, in turn, the standard questions: 
         
        
        
         
         1. Is a duty of care established? (The duty of care issue.) 
         
        
        
         
         2. If so, what is the measure or scope of that duty in the circumstances? (The scope of duty issue.) 
         
        
        
         
         3. Has it been proved that the defendant is in breach of the duty so defined? (The breach issue.) 
         
        
        
         
         4. If so, was the breach the cause of the plaintiff’s damage? (The causation issue.) 
         
        
        
         
         5. (Where relevant.) Were the defaults alleged on the part of the public authority within the area of the authority’s legitimate discretion on questions of policy and allocation of resources so that there was no duty of care owed to the plaintiff? Or was any suggested breach a matter left by law to the authority whose decision the courts would respect and uphold against the plaintiff’s complaints? (The policy/operations issue.) 
         
        
        
         
         6. (Where relevant.) Has contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff been proved and, if so, with what consequence? (The contributory negligence issue.)” 
         
        
        
       
     80 He also said at [117]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In  
         Pyrenees Shire Council v Day 
          [(1998) 192 CLR 330 at 419, adopting  
         Caparo Plc v Dickman 
          [1990] 2 AC 605 at 617-618], I have expressed my preference for the conclusion that three considerations are involved in deciding whether a duty of care exists: 
         
        
        
         
         1. Whether it was reasonably foreseeable to the alleged wrongdoer that particular conduct or an omission on its part would be likely to cause harm to the person who has suffered damage or a person in the same position; 
         
        
        
         
         2. Whether there exists between the alleged wrong-doer and such person a relationship characterized by the law as one of ‘proximity’ or ‘neighbourhood’; and 
         
        
        
         
         3. Whether it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a given scope on the alleged wrong-doer for the benefit of such person.” 
         
        
       
     81 There are two difficulties about relying upon Kirby J’s reasoning. First, it is not supported by a majority of the High Court: Sullivan v Moody (2001) 183 ALR 404 at [49]. The second is that, in particular, the process of locating a duty stated by Kirby J does not appear to be shared by the rest of the High Court. They saw it as a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a duty. Here the Master found that it was not reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that its conduct would be likely to cause harm to the particular plaintiff in view of his experience and skill. The plaintiff’s attack upon that proposition has already been rejected. 
      
       
     82 Though the plaintiff criticises the Master for failing adequately to define the duty resting on the defendant, his own formulation is that the defendant had a duty to take reasonable care to avoid harm to the plaintiff from dangers of which it was aware or ought to have been aware. The plaintiff also submitted that the scope of the duty included the provision of a safe base from which to carry out work. The base – the ladder – was in itself safe. If there were any unsafeness, it proceeded only from the way in which the plaintiff used the ladder. The defendant was entitled to rely on the plaintiff, with his skill and experience, to use the ladder in a manner so as not to cause him injury.  
      
       
     83 The supposed factual findings relied on by the plaintiff are to some extent not supported by the evidence: see the analysis above of the question of how far it can be said that the plaintiff’s behaviour was governed by time pressure. Some of the factual findings are irrelevant: the lack of skill or experience on the part of the plaintiff’s team had nothing to do with the accident. The proposition that a mobile scaffolding platform would have been a cheap and practical response to the foreseeable risk begs the question of whether it was necessary for the defendant to embark on that response. It is a fallacious reading of Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48 to conclude that it holds that if the risk of injury is reasonably foreseeable and removal of that risk by simple and cheap measures is possible but not undertaken, there is a breach of duty. Mason J left open as the response of a reasonable person the course of doing nothing instead of adopting the simple and cheap measures: Council of the Municipality of Waverley v Lodge [2001] NSWCA 439 at [29]. The second last finding is not a finding, but a statement of the plaintiff’s submission below. The surviving findings do not support the conclusion that the defendant was in breach of duty. 
      
       
     84 The preferred position of both the plaintiff and the defendant during the oral argument of the appeal was that, despite the want of evidence for the proposition, the Master’s view that the plaintiff had reached outside the stile area of the ladder and that this was the cause of the fall, was a sound explanation of it. If so, that was a voluntary choice made by the plaintiff, and the fall did not result from any flaw in either the equipment or the system of work being operated. The contest between the parties at the trial did not turn on the precise height the plaintiff was at, but on whether Dr Adams was right that the system was flawed and that the plaintiff should have been supplied with a cherry picker, or a mobile scaffolding unit, or trestles, planks and steel railings, or a different type of ladder. Dr Olsen’s competing view was that the ladder actually supplied was satisfactory if used properly. If it had been used properly, the cause of the fall was unexplained, with a consequential impact on the case of the plaintiff, who bore the onus. If the cause of the fall stemmed from the plaintiff moving his body mass outside the stile area, the ladder had not been used properly by the plaintiff, who was thus the author of his own misfortune. In para [61] the Master in effect found that to lean sideways was to fail to take a rudimentary safety precaution, which the defendant could reasonably assume would have been taken. No error has been demonstrated in that view. 
      
       
     85 The plaintiff relied on Wilke v Astra Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 135. That case is distinguishable. It is not clear whether the experience of the plaintiff there matched that of the plaintiff here. The plaintiff there was an electrician working all over the premises, though he fell from the ceiling; the plaintiff here was experienced at doing the single and repetitive thing he was doing when he fell. There was pressure there, but not here, for work to be done “at great speed”, “in a hurry and for extended hours”. The circumstances there called for a co-ordination of activity between trades, but not here. That case involved the plaintiff working continuously on a narrow beam, not moving up and down a ladder repetitively, as the present plaintiff had often done before. And that case involved the plaintiff moving about surfaces he was entitled to expect to be safe but which were not, whereas this case involved working on an inherently stable and sound ladder in a manner which might involve danger, depending on the user’s perception, depending on the extent to which the user judged that particular safety measures were not necessary, and depending on the extent to which the user employed proper safety measures.  
      
       
     86 Grounds 4 and 5 fail.  
      
       
        
       Ground 6: contributory negligence 
        
       
     87 This ground was amended pursuant to leave to which the defendant consented. There is no need to deal with this ground in view of the fact that the plaintiff’s arguments that a tort, other than the tort of breach of statutory duty which is yet to be considered, was committed against him, have failed.  
      
       
        
       Ground 12: breach of statutory duty 
        
       
     88 This ground was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Appellant’s accident having occurred in circumstances in which Regulation 73 of the Construction Safety Regulations 1950 (NSW) applied, and the factual circumstances not in issue demonstrating a breach of the obligation cast upon the Respondent by that Regulation a verdict without deduction for contributory negligence ought to be entered for the Appellant.” 
         
        
       
     89 Regulation 73 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Any person who directly or by his servants or agents carries out any building work shall take all measures that appear necessary or advisable to minimise accident risk and to prevent injury to the health of persons engaged in such building work and for this purpose without limiting the generality of the foregoing, he shall subject to Regulation 74 - 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         (3) provide means by fencing or otherwise for securing the safety of any person working at a place from which he would be liable to fall a distance of more than 1.8 m … .” 
         
        
       
     90 Regulation 74(1) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where there is a risk that a person engaged in construction work may fall because there is no adequate hand hold or foot hold the person in charge of the construction work shall provide: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) a safety line or safety harness and safety line complying with the requirements of AS 1891 for the use of that person; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a safety net complying with the requirements of BS 3913 while the work is being carried out.” 
         
        
       
     91 The defendant opposed leave being granted to the plaintiff to rely on this ground. It submitted that if the issue had been raised at the trial, its case would have been conducted differently in that the new ground could possibly have been met by calling evidence, and for that reason leave should be refused.  
      
       
     92 The plaintiff’s argument was that whatever the relationship between the parties, the defendant was in breach of its statutory duty under Regulation 73. He submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Master recorded (para 53) Dr Adams’ evidence ‘ 
         that the Plaintiff’s feet would have been approximately 2.7m above the pavement 
         ’, a proposition not put in issue by the Respondent. On the found facts of the accident which were not in issue set out in 1, 49, 55, 67 and 69 of the annexed document, there was a breach of that statutory requirement [ 
         Iskra v Adar Electronics Pty Ltd 
          (1986) 6 NSWLR 282]. No defence of contributory negligence was available against that circumstance – Statutory Duties (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, s 2. 
         
        
        
         
         The regulation was not pleaded in the court below. However, no prejudice would result to the Respondent from allowing the matter to be raised, even at this stage. The majority of the High Court in  
         Vabu 
          [at 181 ALR 272, [31]], speaking of an issue conceded in the Court of Appeal observed: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ 
           All the facts necessary for determination of the question were adduced and proved at trial and no new fact is sought to be or needs to be raised.’  
           (Citations omitted) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         No question of the Respondent’s conducting its case differently at trial arises [cf Callinan J in  
         Vabu 
         , at 296 [113]], as the matters central to the issue were not in issue.” 
         
        
        
       The “found facts” referred to were as follows: 
        
        
         
         “1. Plaintiff fell off a ladder. … 
         
        
        
         
         49. Plaintiff used Defendant’s 12’ aluminium ladder. … 
         
        
        
         
         55. Plaintiff climbed ladder to next rung from the top to affix hooks into roof. … 
         
        
        
         
         67. Plaintiff had been working to a height of 4.8 m from the ground. … 
         
        
        
         
         69. Plaintiff had responsibility to ensure job [completed] by the end of the day. …” 
         
        
       
     93 The defendant relied on the following chronology of events. 
      
       
     94 On 1 September 1998 Dr Adams signed his first report. He said that if the plaintiff was on the second step of “the 3m stepladder”, his feet would have been 2.7 metres above the ground. 
      
       
     95 On 14 May 1999 Dr Olsen provided his first report. He assumed that the ladder height in working position was 3.34 metres, that there were eleven steps, and that the spacing between each step was 300 millimetres. He drew a plan, Figure 1, with a man of the plaintiff’s height, 1.83 metres. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Given that firstly it would be necessary to have clear headspace under the awning, it would not be possible for the plaintiff to be standing on a step above the fourth step from the top. This is clearly seen in Figure 1. Alternatively given that the plaintiff recollects clearly reaching above height it would also not be possible for him to stand above the fourth step from the top even if the ladder was placed outside of the alignment of the awning, so that head height was not restricted by the awning. 
         
        
        
         
         I formed the view that the ladder supplied was suitable in the circumstances and that the description given by Dr Adams does not add up to the physical circumstances and therefore it would appear that Dr Adams has been provided with inaccurate data.” 
         
        
       
     96 On 6 August 1999 Dr Adams provided a further report, commenting on Dr Olsen’s. In it he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I acknowledge that there was a minor error in my report in respect of the height at which Mr Van-Der Sluice was standing on the ladder. It is obvious that if he was attaching hooks and decorations at a height of about 4m and was reaching overhead to do so, then his feet would not have been at a height of more than about 2m above the pavement rather than the 2.7m which I had mistakenly assumed in my original report.” 
         
        
        
       The defendant submitted that “no more than about two metres” might be expressed “relatively close to, perhaps less than, 1.8 metres”.  
        
       
     97 On 21 December 1999 Dr Olsen provided another report commenting on Dr Adams’ second report. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not agree with the conclusions made by Dr Adams. I repeat that it would not be possible to stand on a 12 ft ladder with the shin resting against the top platform.” 
         
        
       
     98 Dr Adams gave oral evidence on 13 June 2000. In chief he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. At that time did you carry out any measurements of the height of the various levels of the ceiling of the Imperial Arcade at the point where the accident was said to have occurred? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I made some measurements but I have since discovered my measurement may have been in error. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What measurement was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I had measured the height at which the decorations were being attached as up to approximately four metres. I have since measured again, although, of course, the arch formation has been demolished but, measuring to the underside of the concrete ceiling within the arcade and outside which and above which the arch was installed, I obtained a measurement of 4.8 metres. I suspect in my measurements I lost one metre, the reason being it is impossible to measure with a steel tape vertically to the ground. I simply lost a metre. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your subsequent measurements, even though the front of the arcade has since been demolished, it is 4.8 metres to the concrete slab inside the arcade? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is right.” 
         
        
        
       It was not clear what 4.8 metres was the length of. He said those measurements were made “a few minutes before coming to court”. The defendant submitted to this Court that it was not possible to test the new measurements for want of notice, despite the fact that the trial had commenced on 3 April 2000, been adjourned on 7 April 2000, and resumed on 13 June 2000, the day on which Dr Adams entered the witness box. The defendant pointed to difficulties in dealing with these measurements arising from the demolition of the façade of the building, and arising from the fact that Dr Adams’ opinion of the height of the awning above the front of the arcade, being one metre, rested on an “estimate” which was “difficult to scale from photographs”. He also admitted that he had never been told the height of the ladder.  
        
       
     99 The defendant submitted that because Dr Adams referred to 1.8 metres in his oral evidence as raising a “need for proper protection”, it must have been in the minds of the plaintiff’s advisers that a statutory count could have been pursued. The plaintiff’s solicitor has filed an affidavit negating this submission and that evidence should be accepted. But the crucial question is not whether the plaintiff’s advisers thought of Regulation 73(3) and rejected it, but whether it can be said that reliance on it could possibly have been met by evidence at the trial. The defendant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Had the statutory count now sought to be relied on been the subject of an application to amend, and had it been permitted, it is clear that the respondent/defendant could, should and would have done many things that might have led to a very different corpus of evidence relevant to the statutory count, such as: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) investigated with some care the history of the now altered façade of the Imperial Arcade; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) engaged engineers and architects to investigate the issue of height; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) approached the evidence of Mr T Clarkson ( 
         who completed the work using the equipment and the system that the plaintiff employed 
         ) somewhat differently; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) considered calling other evidence (for example, Matthew Shaw – Black Book 339L).” 
         
        
        
       Matthew Short assisted Tim Clarkson in completing the work after the plaintiff’s fall. One respect in which Tim Clarkson might have been much more fully pressed would have been the issue of which step he stood on. 
        
       
     100 The plaintiff submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that there was a difference of views on the accuracy of assumed or calculated assumptions. The [defendant’s] expert [Dr Olsen] opined (Blue Book 375/O) that 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ 
           it would not be possible for the plaintiff to be standing on a step above the fourth step from the top.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         This view followed [his] receipt of instructions that the actual ladder was 3.34m long. The [plaintiff’s] expert [Dr Adams] had calculated ladder length from his measurement of the height to the ceiling into which the [plaintiff] was inserting hooks. This measurement was erroneous, the distance was about .8m  
         greater 
         . The [plaintiff] deposed that he was on the second top step and the learned Master so found (RAB 68). This dispute was irrelevant, as Dr Olsen’s premise itself placed the [plaintiff] at a height above 1.8m, namely 2.14m. 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Olsen was instructed that the ladder was 3.34m, (Black Book 374/U) and [he] has used that figure in [his] scale diagram. Dr Olsen’s scale diagram (Black Book 384) depicts the [plaintiff] standing (4 x 300mm) below a height datum of 3.34m, ie, 2.14 above the ground.  
         
        
        
         
         Evidence on the Subject 
         
        
        
         
         The [plaintiff] deposed that the ladder was a single-sided step-ladder, ‘ 
         roughly 12 foot 
         ’ (Black Book 13/E, 30/U), an assessment upon which he was not cross-examined (cf. Black book 69/R). 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Adams in his initial report assumed the ladder to be 3m long. In the absence of the ladder he calculated this from his measured height to the ceiling the [plaintiff’s] height, and the [plaintiff’s] stated position on the ladder. As the [plaintiff] was on the second step he calculated that the [plaintiff] was standing 2.7m above the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         In evidence Dr Adams confirmed that the [plaintiff] would on his original assumptions be standing 2.7m above the ground (Black Book 262/W). Having measured the height of the Arcade ceiling (Black Book 260/P), he assessed that height as ‘ 
         unduly conservative 
         ’ (Black Book 364/N), presumably by the extra .8m which his remeasurement disclosed (Black Book 261/P). 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Adams observed in cross-examination 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ 
           I did not regard the questions of height as being as crucial as the system of work using a ladder for a task that involved stretching and reaching. Once you are above 1.8 metres there is the need for proper protection and the probability of significant injury if a fall does occur. Once the height is above 1.8 metres, although I would certainly prefer to have been accurate, I did not regard it as the crucial determinative of the probability of injury, or the actual nature of the injury 
           ’ (Black Book 265/N). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         He also stated (Black Book 266/Q) that the original inference that the ladder was  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘….  
           no more than 3m 
            ..’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         was a calculation from a height of the ceiling, the height of the [plaintiff] and the [plaintiff’s] statement that he was working from the step below the apex of the ladder (Black Book 267/E). It was the remeasurement of the ceiling height, he said, which rendered the 2.7m assessment of height unduly conservative. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Had I measured the height correctly initially I would have assumed a higher ladder than three metres 
           ’ (Black Book 278/U). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Dr Olsen was shown a ladder which was 3.34m long, and observed that (on the assumption that it was the ladder in question) the [plaintiff] would not have been standing on the second top step (Black Book 375/P). Dr Adams accepted that reasoning (Black Book 369/Q), whilst drawing attention (Black Book 370/E) to the [plaintiff’s] ‘ 
         fairly definite 
         ’ description of his position on the ladder, and the possibility that Dr Olsen had looked at another ladder. 
         
        
        
         
         Of the [appellant’s] other witnesses, only Mr Timothy Clarkson gave evidence relating to the ladder (Black Book 2/338/B). His description of the ladder as a double-sided ladder does not match that described by the [plaintiff] and assumed by Drs Adams and Olsen. He was unable to recall the height to which he ascended to complete the work, but he too found it necessary to raise his arms above his head (Black Book 340/M-B). Cross-examination established that he had said to the police the ladder was an A frame 12’ ladder (Black Book 347/D). 
         
        
        
         
         Neither Dr Olsen nor Mr Smink was called.” 
         
        
       
     101 So far as Dr Olsen is concerned, the correct position is that counsel who appeared for the plaintiff at the trial did not require him for cross-examination.  
      
       
     102 Even though Dr Olsen placed the plaintiff at 2.14 metres above the ground, there is considerable force in the defendant’s arguments. To them might be added the fact that counsel for the defendant at the trial put to the plaintiff in cross-examination only one question suggesting he was on the fourth step, not the second. Counsel for the defendant assured this Court, and there is of course no reason to doubt, that he cross-examined in that way on instructions. Because of the difficulty of meeting a statutory count based on Regulation 73(3), it is very likely that counsel for the defendant would have cross-examined at much more length if the 1.8 metre question had been relevant. The fact that counsel for the defendant did not cross-examine the plaintiff about the length of the ladder also favours the defendant’s contention, not the plaintiff’s contention.  
      
       
     103 Further, if the 1.8 metre figure had been crucial, it may be presumed that a greater attempt to isolate the precise ladder might have been made.  
      
       
     104 So far as there was agreement that the plaintiff was more than 1.8 metres above the ground, it was an agreement arrived at without any specific attention to the issue or any appreciation of its potentially decisive significance. For the case run at the trial, the precise height did not matter. For the statutory count case, it is crucial. 
      
       
     105 For these reasons leave to rely on Ground 12 should be refused. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider particular issues which arose in relation to Regulation 73(3) during oral argument. 
      
       
        
       Damages grounds 
        
       
     106 In the circumstances it is not necessary to deal with these grounds. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     107 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       1. The appeal is dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 11 March, 2002. The applicant and eight co-accused had entered pleas of guilty to a number of offences on 20 February, 2002. This applicant’s plea of guilty was to four counts of larceny and he was sentenced to a total sentence of one year and six months and a non-parole period was specified of nine months. The sentence was made up of a sentence of one year and six months on the third count, taking into account two offences on a Form 1 and a non-parole period of nine months was fixed to expire on 10 December, 2002. On the first, second and fourth counts, he was imprisoned for six months fixed term on each to be served concurrently. 
      
       
     2 The applicant was part of an organised shoplifting syndicate. Ultimately, they all entered pleas of guilty. The shoplifting occurred mainly from large supermarkets in the Sydney metropolitan area but also in some country towns. The shoplifting appears to have been organised principally by members of the Nicholls family, four of whom were sentenced on 11 March, 2002. They usually operated in groups targeting expensive easily disposed of goods in supermarkets. The operations of the group were on a regular basis from the end of 1998 through to May, 2000. A special police task force was set up to deal with the problem of shoplifting and this resulted in the arrest of the applicant and the co-offenders. 
      
       
     3 The criminality of this particular applicant, of course, is restricted to those matters to which he has entered a plea of guilty and they are stealing $4,000 worth of cosmetics on 12 February, 2000 from Woolworths, stealing $5,000 worth of cigarettes and razor blades from Franklins on 4 March, 2000, stealing $11,535 worth of cigars and a cigar humidifier from Mac’s Liquor on 5 March, 2000 and stealing $4,748 worth of men’s toiletries from Amcal Pharmacy on 6 May, 2000. The matters on the Form 1 related to offences of stealing cigarettes and cosmetics in February and March, 2000. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was born on 28 September, 1957 and was 43 and 44 at the time of the offences. He is divorced and has two children. He has a prior criminal record relating to offences of dishonesty going back to 1978. He was given a bond for robbery in 1983, a community service order for receiving in 1988 and a fine for goods in custody in 1992. A pre-sentence report tendered on his behalf said he assisted in the care of his two children and at the time of sentence, he was self-employed with a company dealing with the sports and hospitality industry. He was described as having an alcohol and gambling problem which led him into participating in these offences and also was instrumental in the breakdown of his marriage. He said he no longer had problems with alcohol or gambling, but it was recommended he continue in group programmes. 
      
       
     5 The thrust of the challenge to the applicant’s sentence is based on an assertion of lack of parity and in particular, lack of parity with the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Moore on the co-offender, Green. In sentencing this applicant, the sentencing judge described Green’s involvement as serious. He contrasted with that the involvement of three of the co-offenders including this applicant, whom he categorised as engaged in moderate criminality. He categorised Mr. and Mrs. Bushby, Mark Nicholls and Mrs. Nicholls as engaged in very serious criminality. 
      
       
     6 Green was sentenced for seven counts with nine counts on a Form 1 to three years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of one year and nine months. The argument advanced is that this applicant can entertain a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing his sentence to that of Green, bearing in mind their respective criminality and circumstances. That being the focus of the appeal, it is unnecessary to deal in detail with all of the co-offenders, but those categorised as engaged in serious criminality were given sentences of between four years and four and a half years with non-parole periods between two years and two and a half years. Of the other two offenders categorised by the sentencing judge as having the same degree of criminality as the applicant, Douglas was sentenced to two years, seven months and two weeks, with a non-parole period of one year and four months and Kim Nicholls was sentenced to two years and nine months, with a non-parole period of one year and six months. 
      
       
     7 The sentencing judge was obviously faced with a difficult sentencing task. He recognised the need to avoid disparity in the sentencing and he set out to achieve that objective. It is an objective which cannot be achieved with any degree of mathematical precision. Obviously, the sentence imposed on this applicant was considerably less than the sentence imposed on Douglas and Nicholls, who were said to fall in the same category. No doubt that was because they appeared on more offences. 
      
       
     8 The authorities dealing with the question of parity of sentencing are well-known and the most authoritative cases are The Queen v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 and R v Postiglione (1997) 189 CLR 295. The authorities speak of a “justifiable” sense of grievance, not just a sense of grievance. There must be some sensible objective basis for the grievance which is felt. In this case, I do not see it. It is true that Green was sentenced for 16 offences as compared to the applicant’s six and that this sentencing judge categorised Green’s criminality as serious and the applicant’s criminality as moderately serious. On the other hand, the applicant only received half the head sentence Green received and less than half the non-parole period. Having looked at their respective records and backgrounds, I see nothing to justify any significant differentiation. In my view, the sentencing judge was careful and correct in imposing these sentences and there is no basis to find a justifiable sense of grievance in the case of the applicant. 
      
       
     9 I would refuse the application for leave to appeal.10 SMART AJ: I agree. The orders of the Court are as proposed by Acting Justice Blanch.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: This is an application for an extension of time to appeal against a sentence imposed at Gosford District Court on 13 December, 2001. The applicant entered pleas of guilty to one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, contrary to s52A(2) of the Crimes Act which has a maximum penalty of fourteen years and also to one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, contrary to s52A(4) of the Crimes Act which has a maximum penalty of eleven years. In respect of the first count, he was sentenced to six years, with a non-parole period of four years, the sentence to date from 12 December, 2001 and the non-parole period to expire on 11 December, 2005. On the second count, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of four years imprisonment to date from 12 December, 2001.2 The events which gave rise to the sentences occurred just after midday on 9 June, 2000 on the Pacific Highway near Charmhaven. The applicant was travelling north in a motor vehicle and Mr. McCulloch, the victim of the second charge, was riding his motor cycle south. Mr. McCulloch saw the car hit the median strip and go on to its two passenger side wheels. It then continued over the median strip on to the wrong side of the road to end up almost at right angles to oncoming traffic. Mr. McCulloch’s motor cycle struck the front passenger’s door.3 Mr. Galway, a neighbour and friend of the applicant, was a passenger in the front seat of his motor vehicle. As a result of the collision, he received multiple injuries and died. Mr. McCulloch received compound fractures to the right lower arm, radius and ulna; fractured right wrist, amputation to the top of his right index finger, fractured pelvis, fractures to his right knee, femur and tibia and multiple fractures to his right foot. He is having ongoing treatment and in particular, his left leg needs to be re-aligned and his right shoulder will require further surgery. The evidence of Mr. McCulloch about the accident was confirmed by Mr. Fyffe, who was travelling behind the motor cycle. 4 The applicant was unconscious after the accident. He received a closed chest injury with multiple rib fractures on the left side associated with a lung collapse and bleeding into the chest cavity. There was a fracture of his left clavicle and abdominal injuries with lacerations to the spleen requiring a splenectomy. He also received brain injury. An analysis of the applicant’s blood returned a reading which Dr. Starmer said indicated his blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was between 0.270 and 0.294. The passenger who was killed had a blood alcohol reading of 0.250.5 The applicant could not recall the circumstances leading up to the accident and did not even recall drinking. He gave evidence that Mr. Galway was a neighbour and friend and he was extremely upset by his death. He also said he was upset at the injuries caused to Mr. McCulloch and he apologised for causing those injuries.6 The applicant was born on 16 October, 1962 and was 37 at the time of the accident. He was a police officer for 18 years until 13 June, 2001 when his position was terminated. Evidence was called that for three years prior to the accident he worked as a custody manager at Hornsby Police Station. He was hoping to work until he was 55 when he would obtain a superannuation payout of $350,000. By preserving his rights, his payout figure will now only be $120,000.7 Evidence as to brain injury occasioned by the accident to the applicant came from a report of Dr. Sivewright who said that this caused the applicant ongoing memory difficulties and word-finding difficulties during speech. He is also said to have had an almost complete loss of libido and sexual function. At the time of the accident, the applicant was on a bond to be of good behaviour for three years from 28 January, 1999 on a charge of dangerous driving.8 The challenge to the sentence is based on the assertion that the sentence is manifestly excessive. In R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231, Spigelman CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence … of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) … should be exceptional.” 
          
         
        
       He went on to say: 
        
        
         
         “The period of three … years, once the threshold of abandoning responsibility has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence.” 
          
         
        
       Included in the list of possible aggravating features were the extent and nature of injuries inflicted, the number of people put at risk, the degree of intoxication and erratic driving. 
        
       
     9 Those aggravating features appear to exist in this case and for that reason the sentence which should be imposed is obviously a significant sentence. The applicant’s record was not in his favour, being on a bond for a driving offence and his plea of guilty was not at the earliest stage in the process. The plea was entered after a first trial was aborted and on the day the second trial was to commence.10 All of these cases must be determined on their own facts but I note in R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268 an appeal against a sentence of five years, with a non-parole period of three years and nine months was dismissed. That sentence was for an offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and the blood alcohol reading was 0.20. The appellant there was 30 with no prior history. 11 In R v Khan [2000] NSWCCA 454 an appeal against a sentence of four and a half years, with a non-parole period of three years, four months and fifteen days was dismissed. The offence was a less serious offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The blood alcohol reading at the time of the accident was between 0.200 and 0.210.12 In R v Hill CCA (NSW) unreported 4 December, 1998, an appeal against a sentence of six years, with a three year non-parole period on a charge of dangerous driving causing death was dismissed. The applicant was a disqualified driver and had a blood alcohol reading of 0.113. The applicant was also physically injured and was described as psychologically devastated. His disqualification was for a high range PCA offence.13 In R v Black CCA(NSW) unreported 23 July, 1998, the Crown appealed against a sentence of four and a half years involving a minimum term of two years and three months for aggravated driving causing death and a concurrent fixed term of two years and three months for an offence of aggravated driving causing grievous bodily harm. The Crown appeal was allowed and the respondent was sentenced to five years, including a minimum term of three years. The Court made it plain this sentence was a lenient one, given only because it was a Crown appeal. The blood alcohol reading was in the range between 0.120 and 0.135.14 In R v McDonald CCA (NSW) unreported 12 October, 1998, the Crown appealed against a sentence of five years, involving a two year minimum term on a charge of aggravated dangerous driving causing death and to a sentence of three years involving a minimum term of two years on a charge of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. The respondent’s blood alcohol reading was 0.195. The two victims were in another car. The respondent had prior PCA offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal substituted a sentence of six years, including a minimum term of three years on the more serious count and a fixed term of two years and six months on the other count. Spigelman CJ particularly noted that was a sentence imposed as a result of double jeopardy considerations on a Crown appeal.15 Having reviewed those cases and bearing in mind the general principles of sentencing in these matters, in my view there has been no error by the sentencing judge as to matters of principle. He has given appropriate consideration to the plea of guilty and to the finding that special circumstances exist. The sentencing judge was well aware the applicant was a police officer being sent to prison for the first time. At the end of the day in accordance with all of the authorities, the sentence imposed was well within the appropriate sentencing range. It was not manifestly excessive and I would propose the application for an extension of time to appeal be granted but that leave to appeal be refused.16 SMART AJ: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Acting Justice Blanch.

     1 SHELLER, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     2 BARR, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     3 GREG JAMES, J: The appellant appeals from his convictions on a number of counts of sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     4 He was convicted on all charges contained in an indictment on which he went to trial in the District Court of New South Wales before a jury. The indictment contained one count of sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s.61D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which a maximum penalty of penal servitude for eight years is provided. Counts two to five charged sexual intercourse without consent of a person under the age of 16. These were offences under s.61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is penal servitude for 10 years. Counts six to 10 were charges of aggravated sexual intercourse, also offences under s.61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
     5 The 10 counts reflect crimes committed upon four complainants, count one relating to one adult complainant; counts two to five, a 12 year old complainant; counts six and seven, an adult complainant in circumstances involving the threat of actual bodily harm with an offensive weapon, namely a knife; and counts eight to 10, another adult complainant, again with the threat of the infliction of actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon, namely a knife. 
      
       
     6 The appellant was sentenced as follows: on counts one to three, he was sentenced to a fixed term of four years imprisonment to commence on 23 May 1997 and to expire on 22 May 2001. On count four, he was sentenced to a fixed term of four years to commence on 23 May 2001 and to expire on 22 May 2005. On count five, he was sentenced to a fixed term of four years to commence on 23 May 2005 and to expire on 22 May 2009. On count six, he was sentenced to a fixed term of six years to commence on 23 May 2009 and to expire on 22 May 2015. On count seven, he was sentenced to a fixed term of seven years and six months to commence on 23 May 2015 and to expire on 22 November 2016. On counts nine and 10, he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and six months to commence on 23 November 2016 and to expire on 22 May 2024. A non-parole period of six months to expire on 22 May 2017 was imposed commencing on 23 November 2016. 
      
       
     7 It is thus apparent that there were three accumulations of penalty for offences dealt with at the one time by the sentencing judge. The total sentence is a sentence of 27 years with a non-parole period of 20 years. 
      
       
     8 In this regard it was not submitted that the individual sentences exceeded the permissible exercise of sentencing discretion but it is submitted that the cumulation of these sentences and particularly the cumulation of the individual sentences for individual counts asserted to be a part of the one transaction in respect of the 12 year old victim on counts two, three, four and five, results in a manifestly excessive sentence. It was submitted that overall, whether because of the particular accumulation in respect of the offences against that victim or the overall accumulation, the total sentence is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     9 It is in this regard, however, to be noted that these sentences were wholly concurrent with those imposed by her Honour Judge Payne in respect of the earlier series of offences by the appellant dealt with in the earlier judgment of this court. I shall return to the application for leave to appeal against sentence after examining the one ground of appeal in respect of the conviction. 
      
       
     10 That ground was:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Ground 1 – The directions given by the trial judge on coincidence evidence were inadequate."" 
         
        
       
     11 The circumstances asserted by the Crown to have accompanied the offence against each complainant bore features of similarity. In each case there were certain other similarities in the evidence concerning the attack upon each of the women: the offence took place in a ground floor or first floor unit in Campsie; the attacks occurred upon each complainant in circumstances where either she lived only with other women or where her husband was not at home; a description was given by each complainant of the attacker as an Asian person with black or dark hair, armed with a knife who engaged the complainant in personal conversation about her sexual relationships and experience.  
      
       
     12 There was by way of express evidence of identification, only evidence from the complainant to whom counts eight to 10 refer. About one year and three months after the events she picked out a photograph of the man who had assaulted her during a police photographic identification exercise. She had, a month previously, made a computer image for the police of that person. The photograph she picked out was that of the accused. 
      
       
     13 In addition to the other evidence of similarity, however, there was evidence that in each case the assailant's semen had an identical DNA profile and that that was the same profile as that of the accused. There was expert evidence of the DNA profile that using a Queensland database for Asian people, ""the chance of a person other than the accused Mr. To with the same DNA is round about one in 8.6 billion"" (if one disregarded the chance of a full sibling being involved). The likelihood ratio was also expressed as referring to the chance of that profile being found in someone else and that chance was expressed by Mr. Goetz as ""one in 8.6 billion"", or ""the profile is only found in one in 8.6 billion people"". Mr. Goetz gave evidence that that ratio should be regarded as conservative and favourable to the accused. 
      
       
     14 Prior to his summing up, the learned trial judge sought assistance from defence counsel and from the Crown Prosecutor in respect of any relevant matter that might have to be dealt with in his directions. He noted that the defence was an assertion that whatever had happened in each case, it was not the appellant who was the assailant. His Honour drew counsel's attention to draft directions concerning identification which were accepted by both counsel as being appropriate. Written submissions concerning appropriate matters of evidence going to the application of s.165(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 concerning aspects of reliability of identification were drawn to his Honour's attention. There was some discussion of those matters. 
      
       
     15 During that discussion, the following passage occurred;- 
      
       
        
         
         ""CROWN PROSECUTOR: That [complainant in counts eight to 10's] identification of the accused is admissible against him in relation to the sexual assaults of the other women as well – and the references that may assist your Honour are -- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: [The complainant in counts eight to 10's] identification of the accused, if you accept it, is admissible as evidence -- 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Evidence against the accused in relation to all of the counts in the indictment. I suppose Milat again springs to mind, your Honour. I haven't got Hunt, J.'s directions to the jury but at p.9 in his judgment, he said that that was in irresistible conclusion that there was absolutely no doubt that the same person or persons was or were involved in all offences, therefore the evidence of Onions, that is the man who wasn't murdered, was admissible in support of the Crown case on the murder charges so it is a similar principle. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr. King, I think that is probably an appropriate directions. 
         
        
        
         
         KING: I think the Crown is right. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr. King. I will give that direction in that form. Any others? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, I don't think so, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Any others, Mr. King? 
         
        
        
         
         KING: No, your Honour."" 
         
        
       
     16 On the following morning, in discussion concerning asserted weaknesses in the identification evidence, the Crown Prosecutor relied upon a submission that the other evidence in the case amply and abundantly supported the identification. This was apparently an oblique reference both to the DNA evidence and the likelihood ratio and to features of the assailant's relations with the women which were said to show some similarity. Attempts at identification by the other complainants were unsuccessful. 
      
       
     17 Both counsel accepted that it was an appropriate case for his Honour to give a circumstantial evidence direction. The evidence relating to counts eight to 10 was plainly direct and the DNA evidence, supportive of the identification by that complainant. The circumstantial evidence direction could only have related to inferences that the assailant, in respect of the other counts, was the same person as had been identified by the complainant in counts eight to 10. 
      
       
     18 His Honour directed the jury appropriately concerning the onus and standard of proof. He directed the jury as to the elements of the various counts. He then further directed the jury as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""If you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of the counts, and I am addressing you in relation to all 10 of them at present, that there was sexual intercourse as I have defined it, the accused must be found not guilty. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainants, as defined, then you must consider the second allegation, that is whether it has been proved that the complainant, as to each count, did not consent. This issue of consent applies to all counts. 
         
        
        
         
         It is provided in the Crimes Act that a person who submits to sexual intercourse with another person as a result of threats or terror is to be regarded as not consenting to the sexual intercourse. Here, of course, the accused does not claim that the complainants consented to sexual intercourse. He says simply that it did not happen. He was not there. He was not the person involved. Nevertheless, the Crown does have the obligation of proving not only that he did what is alleged, but also that the complainants did not consent to those action. 
         
        
        
         
         If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have sexual intercourse with the complainants, or any of them, and also that they did not consent then you must go on to consider the third fact alleged, namely whether the accused knew that they were not consenting. The Crown, as I say, must prove the third element, that the accused knew the complainants, and each of them, were not consenting. This is the case, even though the accused is not alleging that he believed that they were consenting, his case being here, as I have said, that he was not there. He did not commit these crimes. If you accept the complainants on the other disputed issues of fact it may be that you would also accept them on the issue as to knowledge on the part of the accused, if you are satisfied that he was there and that he committed these offences. You may ask how, in the absence of an admission by the accused, the Crown can prove that he was aware that the complainants did not consent. The Crown asks you to infer, from other facts which it set out to prove, that he did indeed know, that is that he must have known. If you find beyond reasonable doubt that the complainants screamed, struggled or made remarks which indicated they did not consent you would be entitled to conclude that this was such an obvious sign of the absence of consent that he could not have helped but know it. To reach such a conclusion you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the facts relied upon, that is the screaming, et cetera, to which I referred and also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in those circumstances the accused must have known that the complainants, and each of them, in relation to each charge, were not consenting."" 
         
        
       
     19 Shortly prior to adjourning, his Honour gave the jury directions concerning complaints and gave this further direction:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is a further of direction (sic), on what we describe as being coincidence evidence, and that is this, [the complainant in counts eight to 10] evidence of identification of the accused, if you accept it, is admissible as evidence against the accused in relation to all of the counts in the indictment."" 
         
        
       
     20 His Honour went on to say:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I am not presently dealing with the DNA evidence at this point, but her evidence of identification. I will go into that evidence of identification in further directions which I will give you tomorrow morning."" 
         
        
       
     21 The following morning, his Honour gave directions to the jury concerning expert witnesses and then circumstantial evidence. That direction was as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The next direction on law relates to circumstantial evidence. The DNA evidence has been described as circumstantial evidence. It is not direct evidence. Instead, the Crown sets out to prove certain circumstances, that is facts and events which the Crown says prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty because there is no other reasonable explanation in this case for the DNA results. Circumstantial evidence is not necessarily any less reliable than direct evidence such as the evidence of an eye witness, indeed in some cases it can be more convincing. However, before you can find an accused person guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence you must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable but that it is the only reasonable finding to make."" 
         
        
       
     22 Having directed the jury concerning the accused's evidence and that no onus lay upon him, his Honour then gave directions concerning those matters which might tend to undermine the reliability of the identification evidence and as to the special caution to be used in approaching that evidence. Those directions were lengthy and detailed. They concentrated on those matters which, it had been submitted to his Honour by the appellant's counsel, might tend to undermine the reliability of the evidence. 
      
       
     23 His Honour directed the jury that the complainants other than that in counts eight to 10 had made unsuccessful attempts at identification. He then shortly summarised the evidence relevant to each count from each complainant and the evidence from police officers relevant to the appearance of the appellant at the time of his arrest. He then turned to the evidence of Mr. Goetz and the denials in evidence of the appellant. 
      
       
     24 When his Honour summarised for the jury the arguments of counsel, he referred to the submissions by the Crown Prosecutor that ""there was a general similarity between the crimes"" and made other references to matters to which the Crown Prosecutor referred. She referred to the identification evidence of the complainant in counts eight to 10 and then she referred to the overwhelming strength, as she described it, of the DNA evidence. She said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Crown submits the DNA is enough by itself, but further, that the identification of [the complainant in counts eight to 10] would be strong enough to prove the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt by itself."" 
         
        
       
     25 She submitted, ""this is a very strong case"". She said, ""the judge has to direct you that identification can be notoriously unreliable"", but, she submitted, that ""[the complainant in counts eight to 10] saw her attacker almost throughout and the light in her flat and was galvanised in her fear to remember him"". She quoted from pp.22 and 28 of the transcript of evidence as to that observation. 
      
       
     26 His Honour went on to refer to the Crown's argument as to the vivid recollection of that complainant when identifying the photograph:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""She said that evidence, in her submission, would prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, but then on top of that we have the DNA evidence and she reminds you that Mr. Goetz gave his most conservative estimate of one in 8.6 million people having a similar DNA to those in this case. 
         
        
        
         
         Here she said the complainant in counts eight to 10 also says the accused was the man who raped her."" 
         
        
        
       
     27 His Honour referred to the Crown's submissions on the various features in common to the various attacks and that the jury could take into account that there was evidence that the accused was arrested in Campsie where his mother lived and that in 1988 he had also lived in Campsie. 
      
       
     28 His Honour referred to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant and, in particular as to the DNA evidence, that the appellant had four brothers and that the jury should have been concerned with the dissimilarities between the various cases rather than the similarities. 
      
       
     29 His Honour referred to defence counsel taking the jury through numbered submissions as to the inconsistencies in the evidence including the inconsistencies of description between the accounts given by the various complainant and directed their attention to the content of those submissions. No further applications for directions or making any complaint were made. 
      
       
     30 It is in that context that it is contended that the trial judge fell into error in failing to give a more extensive direction on coincidence evidence. It was submitted that there having been reference to the similarity between the crimes and consistency between features of the crimes, directions should have been given to the jury as to how to use what was described as the coincidence evidence. In that regard, our attention was drawn to The Queen v. G [2000] NSWCCA 198. It was also submitted that no specific direction was given that the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the identification evidence (and by this I understand that reference was being made to the identification of the photograph by the complainant in counts eight to 10) before it could be used as evidence against the accused in relation to all the counts on the indictment. 
      
       
     31 These submissions entirely ignore the circumstantial evidence nature of the Crown's case on the counts other than counts eight to 10 in establishing the appellant was the assailant. Not only was there evidence of the visual identification, but in addition, there was the DNA evidence and the general similarities of occasion, behaviour and appearance of the attacker. 
      
       
     32 Any more explicit direction as to coincidence or similarity evidence would have been bound to bring out in greater detail matters to the disadvantage of the appellant. It was for the jury to consider all of the circumstances and what they accepted of the evidence including the acceptability of the identification evidence in the light of all of the proved facts, see Shepherd v. The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573. It was open to the jury to conclude the identification evidence taken in conjunction with the DNA evidence and the evidence of similar behaviour and appearance established the appellant was the attacker beyond reasonable doubt. The jury did not have to be satisfied the identification evidence established that matter only if they were satisfied of that fact considering the identification in isolation. There was no application for re-direction because, as far as I can see, no further direction as to coincidence or similarity evidence could be seen to be to the advantage of the appellant. The assent given by the defence counsel to the use of the identification evidence in proof of all counts reflects a realisation at trial of the circumstantial nature of the case in relation to the counts other than counts eight to 10. The directions were thought to be adequate by all involved in the trial. I do not see that they did not suit the case. In my view, there is no basis upon which Rule 4 would not apply to the submission now made. Further, as to the asserted deficiency in the directions, no such deficiency is suggested such that there is any possibility of any substantial miscarriage of justice (Festa v. The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 291. 
      
       
     33 I consider that leave should be refused and the ground of appeal rejected. 
      
       
     34 I turn now to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. True it is that the sentences imposed on counts two to five resulted in a heavy overall sentence. However, notwithstanding that the offences arose from the same incident, there is no binding rule requiring the trial judge to impose a concurrent sentence for the various offences. It is only necessary that the trial judge have regard to the offences being committed in the one incident when exercising the discretion as to whether the sentences should be made wholly or partially cumulative. Usually, and as here, the best guide to whether that exercise of discretion may have miscarried is whether in the upshot the sentences so imposed in their totality are manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     35 In my view, these sentences in respect to the crimes against the 12 year old complainant, having regard to what was done to her and her circumstances and age, are such I cannot conclude that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion either to impose sentences as he did or to make them wholly cumulative. They are not manifestly excessive. Further, I do not see that the total effect of the sentences, having regard to the trial judge's cumulation of those sentences and the others, when I have regard to the extent of the criminality involved, is such that I could conclude that the trial judge failed in his discretion in some way such that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed (Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.6(3)). Indeed, to my mind, the trial judge's making these sentences totally concurrent with those imposed in the earlier trial indicated a degree of leniency. If there was an error in this approach it was to the appellant's advantage. 
      
       
     36 In my view, the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted since the matter has been fully argued, but dismissed. 
      
       
     37 I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence be granted and the appeal against sentence dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES, JA: We are in a position to deal with the matter immediately, and I ask Greg James, J. to give the first reasons.  
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: Barzan Mohammad Abdullah seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court of New South Wales in consequence of his having been found guilty by the verdict of the jury of two counts for offences under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He was charged under s.233B(1)(b) with importing into Australia a traffickable quantity of opium contrary to that provision. He was also charged with importing into Australia contrary to that provision a traffickable quantity of cannabis resin. In each case the maximum penalty prescribed by s.235 of the Customs Act 1901 is imprisonment for 25 years. He was sentenced by the learned trial judge to concurrent sentences. In respect of each offence he was convicted and sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, the sentences to commence on 28 May 2001 and to expire on 27 May 2007. The sentence commencement date reflects the applicant having been on bail prior to the trial for a period of time. His Honour took into account, however, in that regard that the applicant had spent approximately one month in gaol following his arrest prior to being granted bail.  
      
       
     3 The facts involved in the commission of the offences were within a very narrow compass. In his remarks on sentence the trial judge summarised them as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""On the 16th August 2000 the prisoner arrived in Australia on a British Airways flight from Bangkok, having previously been in Pakistan where he visited his brother and two sisters. While waiting at the luggage carousel a Customs sniffer dog alerted Customs officers to the shoes the prisoner was wearing at the time. A subsequent inspection of the shoes revealed a number of brown taped packages underneath the innersole of each shoe. On further examination two packages were found in the left shoe and four packages were found in the right shoe. The two packages in the left shoe contained a soft pliable brown resinous substance which, on analysis, was found to be opium. As to the four packages found in the right shoes, one contained a soft pliable brown resinous substance which, on analysis, was also found to be opium while the other three contained a hard compressed brown resinous substance which was found, on analysis, to be cannabis resin. The opium contained in the three packages weighed 395.5 grams while the cannabis resin contained in the other three packages weighed 156.8 grams. The traffickable quantity under the Customs Act legislation for both opium and cannabis resin is 20 grams. When asked by Customs Officer Williams at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, ‘... do you have any drugs on you?’, the prisoner replied, ‘Drugs, no, I have a family, I am a family man, I have a daughter’ and later, when an inspection of his left shoe revealed the existence of the two packages under the innersole of that shoe he was asked, ‘What is this?’ He replied, ‘I don’t know, I didn’t do it, a friend gave them to me as a gift just before I left. I swear I didn’t know it was these’. When spoken to subsequently he exercised his right not to be interviewed. During the course of his evidence during his trial the prisoner repeated that he did not know of the existence of the six packages under the innersoles of his shoes and told the jury he had received the shoes as a gift from a university friend in Pakistan two days before he left to return to Australia. The Jury, by its verdicts, not only rejected the prisoner’s denials as to the existence of the packages and the narcotic goods in question but were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt in relation to the two charges herein.” 
         
        
       
     4 His Honour referred to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. In summary they were that he and his parents had come from Iraq to live in Pakistan but the applicant had come to Australia with his wife and daughter on 29 February 2000, that is to say a matter of some six months earlier than the commission of the offence, under a refugee resettlement programme. The applicant had been granted permanent resident status and had resided in Australia during that six months except for a two-week visit to Pakistan. 
      
       
     5 His Honour noted the applicant was aged 25 at the time of sentence, having been born on 1 February 1976 and that the applicant had the benefit of a good education in Pakistan; that his parents had died while he was residing in Pakistan but the family unit remained together until the applicant came to Australia. He noted that there was, in Australia, family, which he later in his remarks referred to as supportive of the applicant. He noted that there was apparently no criminal history for the applicant in Australia or overseas. 
      
       
     6 His Honour adverted to all the matters to which s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) refers and in respect of each individual matter referred to in s.16A(2) gave individual consideration to all the evidence there might be bearing upon the weight to be accorded to that factor in sentence. His Honour, in addition, referred to the necessity in sentencing for an offence such as this to reflect considerations of general deterrence and in that regard could not be said to have fallen into any error, having regard to the decision of this court in Regina v. El Kahani (1991) 21 NSWLR 370.  
      
       
     7 His Honour categorised the offences as serious criminal offences. He concluded that he should treat them as having arisen out of the same incident and being of equal criminality and in that regard concluded that he should pass concurrent sentences. His Honour concluded that this was not one of those exceptional cases of such an offence under the Customs Act 1901 as not to require a sentence of full-time custody. He applied s.16G of the Crimes Act 1914 to adjust the sentences he was minded to pass to take into account the absence of remissions in the New South Wales prison system.  
      
       
     8 His Honour referred to a number of cases that had been provided to him from which it was said he might derive assistance as to the appropriate ranges for sentence in such a case.  
      
       
     9 He concluded that he did not find any of the judgments of great assistance, merely enabling him to consider them as elucidating the wide ambit of the discretion a judge must apply in fixing individual sentences to meet the needs of particular cases. Of those cases his Honour referred to two as involving persons described as couriers, while the other five he referred to as involving persons described as principals involved in the importation of the narcotic goods in question. When his Honour turned to the nature and circumstances of the offences he concluded that the evidence established that the offender was the person behind the importation and so could be treated as the principal behind it. In addition, he concluded that the quantity of drugs involved in each case was substantial. 
      
       
     10 As far as the cannabis resin quantity was concerned, it was eight times the minimum traffickable quantity and the opium was twenty times the minimum traffickable quantity. Those traffickable quantities are established by the schedule to the Customs Act 1901 and relate to the level of penalty under s.235 which fixes the level of maximum penalty applicable to scheduled quantities of drugs.  
      
       
     11 His Honour concluded that the importation was obviously done for greed and that the offences displayed objective criminality of a high order on the part of the offender, since the offender had recently come to Australia and it appeared to his Honour, the offender was, by the commission of these offences, in these circumstances, displaying contempt for our laws and society and its well-being. He said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “If he maintains such contemptuous views of our laws and society and of its well-being, then his prospect of being a law-abiding citizen of this country are not good.” 
         
        
       
     12 Later in his remarks in a further passage very much to the same effect he referred to the objective criminality as tending towards the higher range of criminality rather than towards the lower “though the quantity of narcotic drugs in question was nowhere near the top of the traffickable quantity”.  
      
       
     13 His Honour also referred to the drugs involved in this exercise as not being as dangerous as heroin or cocaine and referred to the guideline judgment in Regina v. Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 referring to the tariff in respect of two importations of traffickable quantities of cocaine. His Honour said, “This distinction should not be over-estimated in cases involving the importation of narcotics”. His Honour then concluded that, having regard to the community’s abhorrence of this type of offence, he should impose a sentence of six years imprisonment on each count and a non-parole period of four years, as I have said.  
      
       
     14 A number of submissions have been made contending that his Honour fell into error. In support of the first of those submissions our attention was drawn to the decision of the High Court in Olbrich v. The Queen (1999) 106 ALR 330. It was contended that his Honour had erred in inflating the applicant’s criminality by using the language to which I have referred when he described the offender as being “the person behind the importation and so should be treated as the principal behind it”. It was contended notwithstanding there was nothing in the evidence apparently or referred to by his Honour in his remarks to suggest the involvement of any others in the offence that the word “principal” should be interpreted as meaning that his Honour dealt with the applicant as though he were a person involved in some hierarchy of which he was the prime mover or ring-leader. 
      
       
     15 It was accepted during this argument that he should have been dealt with as though he were the sole importer. It was contended that in Olbrich (supra) the discussion and the use of the term principal as opposed to the use of the term importer meant that where that term “principal” was used by a trial judge one should take it that the trial judge was referring to a higher degree of criminality. 
      
       
     16 I do not accept that argument. In this case his Honour was concerned to distinguish between the two categories of persons referred to in the cases to which he had been taken and to which he refers in his remarks on sentence. He was plainly referring to the applicant as being a sole importer, importing on his own account rather than part of an organisation in which he had some subordinate role such as that of a courier or some more prominent role such as that of a principal. 
      
       
     17 In the judgment of the majority of the High Court at paragraph 11, the decision of Howie, DCJ., (as he then was) is referred to where he rejected the contention of the accused before him that he was a mere courier and that he should be treated as such because he had told the police and this court nothing about the circumstances of the event at all. This was a context not unlike that in which the present applicant comes forward on appeal. In a passage commencing at paragraph 13 and continuing to paragraph 18, the judgments of the majority referred to the way in which sentencing judges might approach ascertaining the culpability of an offender in such circumstances and, in particular, where that offender has provided limited information to surround the circumstance of he or she being the importer. The court distinguished between the task then to be undertaken and the task that would be undertaken where there was evidence of drugs imported into the country and there was more than one person connected with the importation of those drugs, and discussed that matter at paragraphs 19-23. 
      
       
     18 There is no doubt that the trial judge’s use of language was infelicitous where he used the word “principal” and referred to the offender as being the person behind the importation. Nonetheless, I do not see that he has fallen into any legal error when I consider those passages from Olbrich (supra) to which I have been referred; nor do I see that there has been translated from the language his Honour used, into the final product of the sentence, such a component as in fact inflates the sentence, as was submitted. 
      
       
     19 Similarly, where it was submitted that his Honour gave excessive weight to the fact the appellant was a recent arrival to Australia, I do not see his Honour fell into error. It was a relevant fact to which his Honour could have regard that the applicant was a recent arrival to Australia in the context in which his Honour had regard to it, that is to say, that the applicant in the commission of these offences in the context in which they were committed was showing contempt for the laws of Australia. It may well be that that matter might be categorised appropriately as relevant to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. It may well be that a display of contempt for the laws on the part of a convicted person coming forward for sentence is a matter that goes to the subjective circumstances or the objective circumstances. I do not find it necessary so to categorise such matters since, in my view, this was plainly a matter that was relevant for his Honour to take into account for one purpose or the other and it cannot be said when one considers the final product of sentence that the matter appears again to have inflated any component in the eventual sentence so as to show error.  
      
       
     20 By ground three of his grounds of appeal the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in concluding that the importation was obviously done for greed. By consent there was before us, as there had been before the trial judge, the evidence at trial of the allegation which it was conceded was established of the applicant’s straitened financial circumstances. It was contended, however, that the onus was on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt an aggravating circumstance, that is, that the offence was committed out of greed and that there was no evidence sufficient to enable such a conclusion to be reached. 
      
       
     21 I disagree. The drugs that were imported may not have been the most valuable drugs, the applicant’s straitened financial circumstances may not have been linked by direct evidence to the prospects of realising from the sale or other marketing of those drugs, monies which might relieve those straitened circumstances, but it was plainly open to the trial judge to conclude in the overall circumstances that the applicant’s commission of the crime was not out of altruism but in order to gain financially and that is quite sufficient to enable the conclusion that the importation was done out of a motive of greed.  
      
       
     22 Two other criticisms were made. At our invitation, counsel for the applicant treated those two criticisms as related and to be argued together; that is, that his Honour failed to give proper weight to the less pernicious nature of the drugs in question and over weighted the objective criminality of the offences such as to produce a sentence which, having regard to the sentences imposed in other cases, exceeded the permissible range. Again, I do not think those criticisms are made out.  
      
       
     23 The submission that was made really was that because the applicant’s sentence approximated a sentence which might have been considered to be the bottom of the range, all else being equal, for equivalent quantities of more pernicious drugs, having regard to the level of the traffickable quantities in the schedule, applicable to the more pernicious drugs, then the sentence passed on the applicant was too high in respect of these less pernicious drugs.  
      
       
     24 Our attention was drawn to cases involving other circumstances, greater quantities and other drugs. These were, in my view, of no assistance. I share the view of the trial judge in that regard. 
      
       
     25 The task of a sentencing court is to exercise a just discretion within given lawful parameters. The task of the appeal court under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to consider the final sentence and whether or not some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. The sentence will be in error if the trial judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he or she allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he or she mistakes the facts or if he does not take into account some material considerations; but the manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is only if there is some such error as I have described, or if the end result is unreasonable or plainly unjust that the court can intervene (see House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505). When I have regard to this sentence and the circumstances proved before and found by the trial judge, I conclude it is a severe sentence but I am unable to conclude that it is plainly unreasonable or unjust, exceeds that range properly available to the trial judge or is attended by any such error as to warrant some other sentence being passed.  
      
       
     26 In my view, since the matter has been fully argued, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     27 GILES, JA: I agree. 
      
       
     28 DUNFORD, J: I also agree.  
      
       
     29 GILES, JA: The formal orders are: leave to appeal granted; the non-parole period of four years stated by the trial judge and fixed in each case is corrected so that it is expressed to be a single non-parole period; appeal otherwise dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Sheller JA: I agree with Barr J. 
      
       
     2 Barr J: The appellant, Quoc Vinh To, appeals against convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentences entered in the District Court. Following a trial, a jury found him guilty of four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. In each case the circumstances of aggravation were the appellant’s threat to inflict actual bodily harm by means of a knife which he held in his hand. Payne DCJ sentenced him to a total effective sentence of twenty-three years and fixed a minimum term of sixteen years.  
      
       
     3 The first offence was committed on Ms Jenny Hong at Campsie on 11 August 1994 and the second on the same complainant at the same place on 5 September 1994. The third offence was committed on Natasha Barlow at Marrickville on 22 May 1996 and the fourth on Jacinth Bourne at Campsie on 24 December 1996. 
      
       
     4 The first ground of appeal asserts that her Honour erred in admitting evidence of identification of the appellant and, having admitted it, in failing to withdraw it from the jury during the course of the trial. 
      
       
     5 Objection was taken to the receipt of the evidence and defence counsel relied on ss 137 and 138 Evidence Act. Relevantly the sections are as follows - 
      
       
       137. Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings  
        
         
         In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
         
        
       
      138. Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence  
      
       
       (1) 
        Evidence that was obtained:  
        
         
         (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or  
          
           
           (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,  
           
          
         is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.  
         … 
         (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: (a) the probative value of the evidence, and (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and  
          
           
           (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
           
          
         (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and  
          
           
           (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and  
            
           (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and  
            
           (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
            
           (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
           
          
         
        
       
     6 Evidence taken in a voir dire established that on the evening of the appellant’s arrest on 23 May 1997, a number of members of the public went at the request of the police to Campsie Police Station to take part in an identification parade. Police chose the participants by entering hotels and clubs and making their requests there. All members chosen were of Asian appearance. No record was made of their names, addresses, dates of birth or nationalities. The appellant and nine other men formed the identification parade. The complainants Ms Hong and Ms Barlow attended. Ms Bourne was unable to attend but her sister, Cassandra Bourne, who had been present at the time of the attack and who had seen the attacker, attended. A separate parade was held for each identifying witness. In each one the appellant and nine other men stood in a line. The appellant was permitted to choose where in the line he would stand, and he made that choice for each successive parade. A number was placed on the floor in front of each man in the parade. Each identification witness was asked to write down the number of any man she recognised. Mr Tran, an official interpreter, attended to assist the appellant. 
      
       
     7 Detective Sergeant Sato, the officer in charge of the investigation, gave evidence. He had no idea of the names, addresses or dates of birth of those participating. He explained that police instructions told him not to record the names, addresses or dates of birth of participants in identification parades. He also said that it was not the practice to photograph line-ups because it was difficult enough to persuade people to take part in them and would become almost impossible if their names and particulars were recorded or photographs taken. 
      
       
     8 The appellant gave evidence and said that all the men in the identification parade except himself were Korean. He could tell that because of their speech and their appearance. He said that the Korean face is bigger than the Vietnamese face and the bone structure different. He did not tell the police this because he was afraid. However, he did tell his solicitor on the following day.  
      
       
     9 Mr Tran said that there were about ten in the line up including the appellant. He believed that there were some Koreans. He heard them speaking. If he had not heard them speak he would have guessed that they were from northern China or Japan. They looked different from the others. There were to his recollection about seven such men. He could not tell whether there might have been more than seven. Later on he described the number of Koreans as six or seven. The other two or so present with the appellant, he said, had skin that was a little darker, indicating that they were from the south of East Asia. He agreed that it was difficult to differentiate between Chinese-Vietnamese and Vietnamese people. He agreed that in many cases it is difficult for other Asians to make the distinction. He said this, among other things - 
      
       
        
         
         Q: Only an extremely Mongolian-looking Asian person would stand out, is that right, from the very northernmost part of the Asiatic nations? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Yes, in general the northern people is bigger there and their skin is also lighter. 
         
        
       
     10 Ms Hong was Korean. She said that most of the time she could distinguish a Korean from a person of any other nationality just by looking. The facial structure and the size of the eyes of Koreans were different. She thought that there were about three Koreans in the line-up. Asked about the country of origin of the other members of the line-up she said - 
      
       
        
         
         A: To be honest, I just recognised a couple of the Koreans and when I saw the accused, I sort of didn’t look at the other men in the line-up. 
         
        
       
     11 Later on there were this question and answer - 
      
       
        
         
         Q: Did you look at every man in the line-up or not? 
         
        
        
         
         A: Yeah, I did, but I didn’t look at them in detail as to determine what nationality they were. 
         
        
       
     12 Ms Barlow gave evidence. She could not recall the country of origin of any of the participants. The racial derivation or country of origin of the participants seemed varied. No one stood out as being from a particular background. 
      
       
     13 Her Honour gave judgment on the following day. She preferred the evidence Mr Tran to the effect that there were seven Koreans in the parade. Her Honour took the view that this did not reduce the probative value of the evidence. She concluded, for the purposes of s 137, that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Counsel had submitted that the identification parade did not accurately represent a compilation of persons similar to the appellant and that the evidence was therefore improperly obtained. Her Honour rejected that submission but held that even if the evidence were regarded as having been improperly obtained she would have admitted it in her discretion. Her Honour citied the relevant topics so arising for consideration under s 138(3).  
      
       
     14 The trial proceeded. During the evidence of Ms Hong it emerged that she knew before she attended the police station that the police had arrested a man. It also appeared that before she went to the police station, Ms Jacinth Bourne received a telephone call in which she was informed that the police had a suspect. There was no renewal of the application to exclude the evidence. 
      
       
     15 It was submitted on appeal that her Honour misapplied the test under s 137 and made no attempt to balance the probative value of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice. Having reviewed the evidence, her Honour said this - 
      
       
        
         
         For the purposes of this judgment I will, as submitted by defence counsel, take the view that the onus is on the Crown to persuade me (that) the evidence is not unduly prejudicial or the probative value of it is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. (Her Honour referred to a text and continued) I have been so persuaded in this case, having considered all of the evidence and the argument. Identification evidence is very relevant evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         I prefer the evidence of Mr Tran to that of the other witnesses accepting that there was seven Koreans of the nine. This does not to my mind in all the circumstances reduce the probative value of the evidence in any significant way. All of the matters put by defence counsel can be put to the jury. They go to the weight of the evidence. 
         
        
       
     16 I do not accept the appellant’s submissions. It sufficiently appears from the portion of the judgment which I have extracted that her Honour had in mind the test required by s 137 and that her Honour applied it. 
      
       
     17 The next two submissions may be dealt with together. They were that her Honour erred in concluding that the probative value of the evidence was not reduced in any significant way by the fact that six or seven members of the line-up were Koreans and that her Honour made no attempt to assess the danger of unfair prejudice.  
      
       
     18 These submissions are made in the face of her Honour’s finding that the presence of the Koreans did not reduce the probative value of the evidence in any way. That finding was based at least partly on the evidence of Mr Tran to the effect that all the men looked similar or only slightly different and of Ms Hong that she noticed only three men that impressed her as being Korean. (Unlike Mr Tran, of course, Ms Hong was not permitted to hear the participants speaking). So even on Mr Tran’s evidence, the appellant’s entitlement was met, namely a parade of persons of about the same age, height and general appearance as himself: Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395; R v Fischer [2001] NSWCCA 380. 
      
       
     19 Her Honour impliedly rejected the evidence of the appellant that all nine members other than himself were Korean, and that was unsurprising in view of his failure to say so to the independent police officer who interviewed him afterwards.  
      
       
     20 There was no evidence to suggest why the presence of Koreans should have affected the integrity of the identification evidence of Ms Bourne or Ms Barlow or that either was likely to distinguish between Koreans and other Asians including Vietnamese persons.  
      
       
     21 In my view her Honour was entitled on all the evidence to conclude that the probative value of the evidence was not significantly reduced, that there was little or no unfair prejudice likely to flow and that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the danger of any unfair prejudice. 
      
       
     22 The next submission on appeal complained that her Honour did not carry out the balancing process independently for the evidence of each of the three identifying witnesses. 
      
       
     23 In my opinion no error has been shown. As I have said, the only identifying witness who made any distinction at all between Koreans and others was Ms Hong. But the distinction was unimportant in her identification because of her evidence which I have extracted above. Moreover, so generally alike were all the members of the line-up that Ms Hong, lacking the opportunity to hear any of the participants speak, thought that only about three were Korean. Her position, then, was little different from that of Ms Bourne and Ms Barlow, neither of whom appears to have noticed the distinction relied on by the appellant.  
      
       
     24 The next submission on appeal was that her Honour’s assessment of unfair prejudice had to take into account the lack of a photographic record or a video record of the identification parade. The implication was that it did not. As I have said, the arguments made by defence counsel were not recorded. Her Honour said that she took them into account. There is no reason to believe that her Honour was not invited to consider such a submission or that her Honour did not take it into account. 
      
       
     25 The next submission relied on s 138 Evidence Act and was to the effect that the police failed to take every precaution reasonably available to guard against a miscarriage of justice and that her Honour was therefore wrong in concluding that the evidence was not improperly obtained. Reference was made to Alexander v The Queen.  
      
       
     26 It was pointed out that in February 1998 the New South Wales Commissioner for Police published a booklet entitled “Procedures for the Evidence Act”, containing the following instruction - 
      
       
        
         
         If a video camera is available, tape the entire parade. If not, take a photograph depicting all participants, including the suspect. 
         
        
       
     27 In my opinion this document does not assist the appellant’s case. It shows that police procedures underwent a significant change after the identification parade in the present case. Detective Sergeant Sato’s unchallenged evidence was to the effect that when the identification parade was held there were what were considered to be good reasons why it was not the practice to photograph participants in an identification parade and why instructions forbade the recording of personal particulars of participants. Now things have changed, and where possible there will be a photographic record which will enable accused persons to put before trial courts a more accurate idea of how things appeared when they were identified at an identification parade. If the fears of the police are realised, of course, fewer members of the public will be prepared to take part in such parades, to the disadvantage of other accused persons. Here the accused had the benefit of an identification parade he might not have had if the 1998 instructions had applied, and was thereby protected from the risks of less reliable methods of identification to which police officers might then have resorted. 
      
       
     28 All the appellant has demonstrated is that the evidence in his case was obtained under a regime different from that which now apparently obtains. That does not demonstrate to my mind that what happened was improper.  
      
       
     29 Finally it was submitted that the evidence of Ms Hong and Ms Bourne that they were told that there would be a suspect in the line-up required her Honour to reconsider her decision to admit the evidence under ss 137 and 138. It was also submitted that the evidence might offend s 114(2) Evidence Act because influence might intentionally have been brought to bear on a witness to identify the appellant. S 114(2) is in the following terms - 
      
       
        
         
         114. Exclusion of visual identification evidence 
         
        
        
         
         (2) 
          Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:  
          
           
           (a) an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or  
            
           (b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or  
           
          
         (c) the defendant refused to take part in such a parade,  
          
         and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant.  
         
        
        
       
     30 It seems obvious that even without being told, any witness attending an identification parade would expect that one of the participants would be a person the police suspected to be the offender. See R v North, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales 4 December 1998 unreported in the judgment of Mason P at 9. In my view, to tell a potential identifying witness such a thing would not affect the expectation of that person. Accordingly, I do not think that the expectation of Ms Hong or Ms Bourne would have been materially different from that of Ms Barlow, who was not told any such thing.  
      
       
     31 Counsel informed this Court that the police did not here follow the usual practice of informing proposed identification witnesses that the offender himself was not necessarily a participant in the line-up. Nothing was put before the Court to demonstrate that there is such a practice and no authority was cited requiring such a practice to be followed. The judgment of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72 at 48-52 suggests that there may not be such a practice.  
      
       
     32 In my opinion her Honour was not required by the emerging evidence to reconsider her earlier decision. Defence counsel obviously took the same view, because no application to that effect was made. I would refuse leave to appeal on this basis. In my opinion the first ground of appeal has not been made good. 
      
       
     33 The second ground of appeal complains that her Honour erred in admitting evidence of DNA analysis. Semen was recovered from Ms Hong after the second attack on her and she swore that her attacker in each instance was the same man. Semen was recovered from Ms Bourne and Ms Barlow. DNA was extracted from all samples taken and compared with DNA extracted from the appellant’s blood. The appellant could not be excluded. The Crown wished to adduce evidence about the statistical rate of occurrence of the relevant DNA profile. Defence counsel objected and a voir dire was held. The Crown called a forensic biologist, Mr Goetz, to give evidence. The defence had in court Dr McDonald, a forensic biologist. There was this exchange - 
      
       
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Can you (sic) assume there has been no agreement?  
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, both parties have talked to Mr Goetz before Court. Mr Wilkinson asks for the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Goetz on a couple of issues. 
         
        
        
        WILKINSON (Defence Counsel): It’s a narrow issue. 
        
        
        HER HONOUR: What is your objection to the evidence? 
        
        
         
         WILKINSON: To the statistical data that’s been used. There will be cross-examination of Mr Goetz in respect to certain segments of the DNA profile and the data from which he obtained it. Now, your Honour will have to make a ruling in accordance with the evidence that he gives as to whether or not the objection is maintained. 
         
        
        
         
       HER HONOUR: So you are not objecting at this point? 
        
        
         
         WILKINSON: I’m objecting to the statistical data but your Honour, having spoken with both my expert and in conferences with Mr Goetz the issue is very narrow and it’s a matter in my view -- 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Can we say you are not taking the objection until you hear Mr Goetz’s evidence? 
         
        
        
        WILKINSON: I object to it at this present time. 
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: You object to the statistical weighting to the evidence? 
         
        
        
        WILKINSON: Yes. 
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: So you are Madam Crown leading evidence to support the statistical validity of the data basis used? 
         
        
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right, your Honour.  
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: So there has been no agreement obviously because you are objecting to it. 
         
        
        
         
         WILKINSON: Yes, I am, but it’s in relation to a very narrow issue. It’s a matter that I’m sure will be clarified this afternoon. 
         
        
       
     34 When Mr Goetz made his initial report he produced figures drawn from an Australian database. When he was told at trial that the offender was said to be Asian he consulted different databases and used them to produce statistical results. He produced a chart showing the rate of occurrence in various Asian population databases of results identical to those achieved in his tests. He concluded, by reference to the chart, that the figures differed from those taken from the Australian database but that there was not a great deal of difference statistically in the rates of occurrence of identical results between the different Asian databases set out in the chart. 
      
       
     35 Discussion followed, during which her Honour asked Mr Goetz about the sizes of the Asian databases and a view expressed by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Milat (1996) 87 A Crim R 446 that a database of at least two hundred is required for statistical significance. Reference was made to his Honour’s remarks about confidence limits and Mr Goetz gave some illustrations to show how confidence limits are applied. He went on to say that there was an alternative approach, which was “probably the now recommended approach which suits and in some respects supplants the confidence limit approach”. That was a kinship co-efficient factor known as FST, which took into account “population size, dependency between individuals and so forth”. He said that the National Research Council of the United States stated that in most populations for which there is no database, so that one had to refer to other databases of similar populations, it was appropriate to use an FST factor of 1%, but that if the population is quite dissimilar then about 3%.  
      
       
     36 He explained that in drawing conclusions from the databases he had used he had taken two conservative steps. The first was to apply an FST factor of 3%. The other was never to use the results of testing at more that one locus on any chromosome in case there should be any dependency between loci on the same chromosome. (No such dependency has been shown to exist by reference to Australian databases, which routinely catalogue results of tests of loci on the same chromosome). 
      
       
     37 In order to produce his results, Mr Goetz used two Chinese databases, one of the results of one hundred and five tests on loci known as DQá and the polymarkers (6 loci) and the other of the results of one hundred and twenty-one tests on four Short Tandem Repeat loci. Having taken the two conservative steps I have mentioned, Mr Goetz concluded that the chances of a random match between two pieces of DNA having the profile of all the samples tested was 1 in 1.1 million, according to the Chinese databases. 
      
       
     38 Mr Goetz was asked which confidence limit he had applied and said that he had not applied any and that that process was totally different from the application of the 3% FST factor. He said that one could not do both. He went on to say, however, that if he applied a 95% confidence limit to the raw figures drawn from the two databases he had used, the chances of a random match would reduce from 1 in 6.9 million to a range between 1 in 2.5 million and 1 in 19 million. 
      
       
     39 Mr Goetz was of the opinion that the databases he used were of sufficient statistical validity to warrant the use of the evidence. The chart he produced showed rates of frequency of occurrence in other Asian populations of DNA profiles identical to those produced on test. Those populations were Korean (2), Japanese (4), South East Asian, Asian (2), Thai and US Asian. They showed that the rate of occurrence of identical results was not statistically significantly different from the rate in the databases used by Mr Goetz. 
      
       
     40 Mr Goetz was cross-examined about database sizes and was reminded that in R v Milat he had said that the minimum requisite size was two hundred samples. He said that scientific opinion had changed since he gave that evidence and that many workers now considered one hundred to be adequate. He was cross-examined at length on topics not relevant to this ground of appeal and reiterated that his application of a 3% FST factor was more conservative than the application of a 95% confidence limit. 
      
       
     41 The defence did not call Dr McDonald to give evidence. In a written judgment her Honour made an extensive review of the evidence I have summarised and decided to admit the evidence objected to. 
      
       
     42 The first submission on appeal was that the use by Mr Goetz of Chinese databases failed to comply with what was said by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Pantoja (1996) 88 A Crim R 554. In that appeal the complaint was that the appellant was of a peculiar racial extraction and that the evidence did not establish whether the database used contained results of tests of DNA of persons of that extraction. His Honour said this - 
      
       
        
         
         Much was also made of this issue on the hearing of the appeal, but to my mind the submissions proceeded upon the wrong assumption that it was the appellant’s race that was important. That is wrong because it must be the offender’s race, not the suspect’s race, which dictates the validity of the database.  
         
        
       
     43 In the present appeal Ms Hong, Ms Barlow, Ms Jacinth Bourne and Ms Cassandra Bourne all described the attacker as Asian. Ms Hong said that he had a Vietnamese accent. It was submitted that since nobody described the attacker as being Chinese it was inappropriate to use a Chinese database. That submission implied that the only valid database would have been an Asian database. Counsel made no attempt to explain what such an Asian database might comprise. There was no attempt to explain precisely what the term “Asian” meant.  
      
       
     44 Her Honour’s duty was to enquire whether the results produced by the databases used were likely to be reliable. Her Honour was obliged to have in mind what Hunt CJ at CL said in the passage which I have quoted, but I do not understand his Honour to have been laying down any rule of law. To say that the offender’s race dictates the validity of the database is one thing. It is quite another to say that reliable evidence can never be produced by the use of a database which cannot precisely be described as of or including the offender’s race. It would not be suggested, I think, that statistical evidence of the kind objected to would be altogether inadmissible if the race of the offender were not known.  
      
       
     45 Insofar as it relies on what his Honour said, the appellant’s submission proceeds on the misunderstanding that the description “Asian” refers to a particular race rather than merely to a generally appearance. The description is imprecise. Asia may be regard for these purposes simply as a part of the world and Asian as denoting a person appearing to come from that part of the world. It might also denote a person appearing to belong to any of the nations of Asia.  
      
       
     46 The submission ignores the evidence of Mr Goetz to the effect that the test results revealed in the several databases he examined were statistically significantly similar. It also ignores the fact that the Chinese race is the most numerous Asian race.  
      
       
     47 In my opinion her Honour was entitled to rely upon the evidence of Mr Goetz as to the statistical similarity of results produced by the several databases he considered. Her Honour was entitled to come to the view that she did, based upon that evidence, that the statistical evidence had sufficient probative value. 
      
       
     48 The trial out of which this appeal arises took place in April and May 1998. Some eighteen months later this appellant was tried for sexual offences committed on other complainants. Mr Goetz gave evidence at that trial. The DNA tests he carried out were done according to a different system, superseding the methods used in relation to the present trial. Different databases were used. An attempt was made on appeal to call in aid some evidence given by Mr Goetz at the second trial to the effect that a fairer database to use was an Asian database.  
      
       
     49 It seems to me that there are several reasons why it was impermissible for counsel for the appellant to make such a submission. First, the evidence about the appropriateness of the use of one or other of several databases must have been different. The complainants were different and presumably their reports were different from those made in the present case. Secondly, Mr Goetz was using different methods in a different system. There is no reason to suppose that the databases he used had any relation to those used in the present case. 
      
       
     50 Thirdly, and most importantly, it seems to me that it is impermissible for counsel, as though relying on fresh evidence, to impugn her Honour’s decision by reference to evidence which was not before her. This appeal is based upon what is said to have been her Honour’s error in admitting the evidence. In attacking her Honour’s decision counsel is necessarily restricted to the evidence that was before her Honour, for she cannot be said to have erred by reference to evidence that was not put before her. 
      
       
     51 The next two submissions may be dealt with together. The first was that the evidence should have not have been received unless the 95% confidence limit had been applied. Reference was made to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Milat. The second was that it was necessary to apply the restriction provided by the confidence limit in addition to that provided by the application of the FST factor. The two approaches, it was submitted, were not alternative.  
      
       
     52 The submissions ignore the unchallenged evidence of Mr Goetz. There appears no reason why her Honour was not entitled to accept at face value his evidence that it was more conservative to apply the FST factor than the confidence limits suggested and that the two were alternatives. It was never put by defence counsel that Mr Goetz’s approach was not sound.  
      
       
     53 In support of this submission also, counsel attempted to argue by reference to evidence given by Mr Goetz at the second trial. It was said that he there expressed the view now contended for, namely that the two approaches are not alternative and that both can and should be applied in circumstances like those existing in the present case.  
      
       
     54 As before, the submission must be rejected. Whatever Mr Goetz may have said in another trial at another time dealing with other circumstances and other systems is here unexaminable. It could never be said that her Honour erred by reference to any such evidence, which could never have been put before her. 
      
       
     55 The final submission drew attention to the differences between the figures given by Mr Goetz as arising from Australian databases and from Chinese databases. No complaint is made about the directions given to the jury that they should not approach the matter upon any strictly mathematical basis, but it was submitted that the two differing results must have been misleading and confusing to the jury. 
      
       
     56 How the evidence must have misled or confused was not explained, and counsel added nothing orally to a short and formal written submission on this topic.  
      
       
     57 In my opinion there is no substance in this submission. The second ground of appeal also fails. I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     58 The maximum sentence for each offence is twenty years’ imprisonment. On the first and third counts her Honour sentenced the appellant to concurrent fixed terms of six years and nine months’ imprisonment, on the fourth count to a wholly cumulative fixed term of seven years three months and on the second count to a wholly cumulative term of nine years, comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of seven years. The resulting effective sentence comprised a minimum term of sixteen years and an additional term of seven years.  
      
       
     59 Her Honour arrived at those sentences by beginning with these sentences and reducing them to reflect the multiplicity of sentences and the principle of totality - 
      
       
        
         
         Count One: ten years with a minimum term of six years nine months; 
         
        
        
        Count Two: twelve years with a minimum term of eight months; 
        
        
         
         Count Three: ten years with a minimum term of six years nine months; and  
         
        
        
         
         Count Four: eleven years with a minimum term of seven years three months. 
         
        
       
     60 It was not submitted that the individual sentences fell outside the range of her Honour’s sentencing discretion. What was submitted was that the total term exceeded what was necessary to reflect the totality of criminality and that the ultimate sentence was crushing.  
      
       
     61 Counsel acknowledged that her Honour lacked the power to impose partially concurrent and partially consecutive sentences (see now s 55 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) with the effect that it was practically impossible to comply with the directions of the High Court of Australia in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 and Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. It was formally submitted that in the circumstances the only appropriate way to deal with the problem was to impose wholly concurrent sentences for most if not all of the offences. 
      
       
     62 Ultimately, as counsel acknowledged on appeal, the matter is one of impression. My impression is that although the total effective sentence was long it was no longer than what was permitted to reflect the criminality of the appellant. I do not think that her Honour fell into error. I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     63 Greg James J: I agree with Barr J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed at Sydney District Court on 23 November, 2001. On that day, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s112(2) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. He was sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment to commence on 14 July, 2001. A non-parole period was specified of three years to expire on 13 July, 2004. In imposing the sentence, the judge took into account an offence of possessing 0.09 grams of heroin. 
      
       
     2 The facts presented to the Court were that on Saturday, 14 July, 2001 at 6.45 a.m. the applicant and Wayne Elliott entered the Bova Chemist shop at Caringbah by smashing a window. Elliott levered open the roller door to the shop and the applicant went in and stole drugs, a cash box and a number of telephone cards. Some of this activity was recorded on a security video tape and at 7.15 a.m. both the offenders were arrested. In the course of this arrest, the applicant managed to run away from the police but was chased and caught after a short distance. The police indicated that the applicant was not interviewed on his arrest because of his drug-affected state, he apparently having swallowed some of the Serepax tablets taken from the chemist shop. The sentencing judge came to the conclusion that the offence could not be categorised as one of the most serious forms of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing. There was no weapon, there was no violence, there was no actual harm to any person, there was no deprivation of liberty and it appears to have been an offence committed with only a moderate degree of planning. 
      
       
     3 The applicant has a long history of drug use. It appears the offence was motivated by a desire to obtain drugs. As soon as the applicant got the drugs, he took them. This Court has often said that an addiction to drugs is no excuse for committing crimes. It can, however, sometimes lead to an understanding of the motivation for the commission of a particular crime. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was born on 12 May, 1976 and he was 25 at the time this offence was committed. The pre-sentence report indicated his parents divorced when he was three. His father was killed in a helicopter accident in 1990 and that apparently had a tragic effect on him. He ran away from home and began using drugs and committing offences. His history since then has been one of a constant struggle against his drug addiction. The sentencing judge summarised it in this way: 
      
       
        
         
         “According to the pre-sentence report the prisoner undertook the Odyssey House Drug Rehabilitation Program in 1995 for seven months and appeared to those who were conducting that program to be committed to his rehabilitation. He recently, as a condition of his suspended sentence, attended the Kadaicha House Rehabilitation Program and again was the subject of positive reports concerning his commitment to rehabilitation. He has from time to time been on a methadone program and I am told that he is now on one. Unfortunately, all of these good attempts appear to have come to nothing as soon as the prisoner has left the structured environment of these respective rehabilitation programs.” 
         
        
       
     5 The applicant has a criminal history going back to Sutherland Children’s Court in 1992 and it is a continuous history of dishonesty and drug offences from then until this offence was committed. He has served periods in custody imposed by the Local Court but this was his first appearance before the District Court. On 10 November, 2000 he received a suspended sentence of nine months at the Downing Centre Local Court and the nine month bond associated with that order was current at the time this offence was committed. 
      
       
     6 Two comments by the sentencing judge are the subject matter of the appeal. The first is the statement that “… there are two serious matters of aggravation in this prisoner’s situation. He has for a man twenty-five a depressingly lengthy criminal history …”. It may be the sentencing judge was using this term loosely in the context of the pressure of work in the District Court. Unfortunately, on the face of it, it appears to infringe the principle restated by Justice Gummow in Ryan v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 815 at paragraph 67 where he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The ‘cardinal rule’ is said to be that, whilst ‘good character’ may operate in mitigation, ‘bad character’ cannot operate in aggravation because a person is not to be punished or punished again for crimes other than that for which sentencing is passed.” 
         
        
       
     7 The second point raised about the sentencing judge’s remarks is that the judge noted the plea was at the earliest date in the Magistrates’ Court but he assessed its utilitarian value as falling “towards the bottom of the range.” Insofar as assessing the plea of guilty as an expression of contrition, the judge noted “The prisoner was caught virtually redhanded” but went on to say “Nonetheless I accept that he is contrite.” Bearing in mind the plea of guilty from the outset and a finding of contrition, it is said that the allowance of a six month discount on a six year sentence is not an appropriate discount for the plea within the principles enunciated in R v Thompson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
      
       
     8 In my view the submissions made on behalf of the applicant in respect of both these matters establish that on the face of it, an error has occurred and there will need to be a re-sentencing. 
      
       
     9 In that re-sentencing process, it will be necessary to take into account the sentence which has since been passed on the co-offender Elliott. On 1 May, 2002 he came before another judge in the District Court and he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a minimum term of eighteen months. That sentence was imposed partly on the basis that it was accepted Elliott had gone to the local McDonald’s restaurant to buy his breakfast and was walking home when he met the applicant near the chemist shop and the applicant said to him “Mate, can you give me a hand to get this door open?” and he agreed to help the applicant open the door. He said he had no involvement beyond that. He did not go into the shop and he was given a bag of coins as his part of the proceeds. Elliott also had a significant criminal history and also had a drug problem. There is the need in this case to avoid a justifiable sense of grievance when imposing a sentence on this applicant. 
      
       
     10 As I have indicated, the sentencing of Elliott was done on the basis that he was minimally involved in the commission of this offence. Elliott was also on a bond to be of good behaviour for eighteen months for an offence of stalking at the time of the offence. In my view, there is justification in imposing a greater sentence on this applicant than the sentence imposed on Elliott because there is no doubt the applicant was the person who went into the shop and stole property. He must be sentenced on the basis of full culpability for the offence. That is quite different to the way in which Elliott was sentenced. 11 A countervailing consideration in this case is the fact that Elliott did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Indeed, he was committed for trial to the District Court and a trial commenced on two occasions, and both trials were aborted. It was only after both of those trials were commenced, and he came before the Court on a third occasion, that he entered his plea of guilty.12 I note that in sentencing Elliott, Hosking DCJ indicated that he had given to Elliott an almost 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. That is a countervailing factor, when considering that this applicant has a greater degree of culpability in the crime.13 Weighing those two matters together, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed and the sentence quashed. I would impose a sentence of three and a half years imprisonment to commence on 14 July, 2001 and in respect of that head sentence and allowing for special circumstances, I would specify a non-parole period of twenty one months to expire on 13 April, 2003.14 SMART AJ: I agree. The orders will be as proposed by Blanch AJ.

     1 BLANCH J: This is a Crown appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 from an order made by Judge Finnane on 18 January, 2002. 
      
       
     2 The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of affray pursuant to s93C of the Crimes Act which proscribes a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. His Honour dismissed the charge pursuant to the provisions of s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. The Crown submission is that the sentencing judge erred in applying the provisions of s10 and that in the result the order of the Court was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     3 A statement of facts was tendered which stated that at about 12.15 a.m. on Saturday, 28 October, 2000 the respondent was at Galaxy World, George Street, Sydney with three friends. They became aware of the presence of another group of people with whom there had been a previous incident and one of the respondent’s friends then went to telephone his brother to ask him to return to the city and the brother did so with another friend. At 12.50 a.m. the respondent and the collected group of his friends met at Galaxy World and walked to Dungate Lane “for the purpose of confronting the other group. They knew that a fight was likely to take place. 
      
       
     4 On reaching Dungate Lane, the group, including the Defendant, armed themselves with bottles and approached the other group. Initially pushing occurred and then blows were struck between the groups. Bottles were thrown and persons were chased in the alley way but not by the defendant. Windows to cars were smashed. Persons, not including the defendant were kicking and punching and hitting with bottles. 
      
       
     5 The Defendant later told investigating police that he didn’t have time to throw a bottle but saw Carlo Estera fighting with two people. The Defendant then went and “swung” one of the persons off Carlo Estera. The defendant was then grabbing him on the ground (ERISP 18/12/00 Q183). The Defendant stated that he was “grabbing the guy and stuff, pushing him round, I hit him”, (ERISP 18/12/00 Q216). A witness, Cuong Lam later complained to police of being struck to the face by the Defendant. 
      
       
     6 After a period of time the fight died down. The participants from the Defendant’s group left the laneway. They returned shortly after they realised one of their number had dropped his car keys. At this point a group of other people arrived from a nearby nightclub and the fight resumed. Shortly after the fight resumed the Defendant was running to assist a friend. He then told police, “I must have tripped and found myself on the ground,” (ERISP 18/12/00 Q239). The Defendant remained on the ground for the rest of the fight. During this time the Defendant was attacked on the ground by a number of other persons. The Defendant was hit with kicks and bottles. He was also struck about the body and head with a car steering wheel lock. The defendant suffered a fractured arm, a laceration to the head requiring stitches, and cuts and bruises to the legs and back.” 
      
       
     7 At the hearing of this matter before the sentencing judge the respondent gave evidence. His evidence was that he did not know there was going to be a fight until he got to the lane. He said he was standing behind the others next to a person called Rod when he was accosted by a man sitting in a car. He said that man got out of the car and came at him and he thought he was going to be hit so he “hit him first” with his fist to the man’s head. He then walked off with Rod. He said his other friends followed until someone realised they had left their keys behind in the lane so they went back to get the keys. He said he was following behind his friends and saw one of them attacked by five people. He went to go to his friend’s assistance but he was knocked over and he was then assaulted apparently with a bottle and also with a wheel lock. He was subsequently taken to hospital and he said he had two broken arms and a number of cuts and bruises to his body. He said he had never been involved with either of the groups “in any situation prior to this particular night”. He gave specific evidence that he did not pick up a bottle. 
      
       
     8 The evidence given by the respondent contradicted the statement of facts which had been tendered. In particular it contradicted the assertion in the statement of facts that the respondent’s group “… walked to Dungate Lane for the purpose of confronting the other group. They knew that a fight was likely to take place.” It also contradicted the assertion in the statement of facts that “…the group including the defendant armed themselves with bottles and approached the other group.” The respondent was cross-examined about why he had told the police he had a bottle and he said he was “probably confused” when speaking to the police. 
      
       
     9 The sentencing judge made findings of fact arising from the evidence given which included the showing of a video of part of the incident in Dungate Lane. The judge’s findings included the fact that “others in the group decided this would be a good opportunity to confront another group”. The sentencing judge also noted the offender himself was not a member of either of these gangs. He also said of the respondent: “Having seen him give evidence and be cross-examined, I am prepared to accept he did not have a bottle in his hand.” The sentencing judge then accepted the version given by the respondent as to how he came to punch one man. He also noted that the video shown to the Court of part of the fighting in Dungate Lane did not show the respondent involved in that fighting. He also appears to have accepted the assertion of the respondent that he had no intention of fighting and was there because his friend Mr. Lee Tran was going to his home later that day. 
      
       
     10 The sentencing judge concluded “I am satisfied on the evidence that he did not intend to involve himself in this affray, that essentially his striking of the man Kung Lam was done in the form of self-defence, but of course, in the circumstances, that would not have justified him in pleading not guilty because he could equally have just walked away from the lane. Once he involved himself in striking someone, he took part in an affray so he correctly pleaded guilty to an affray. The affray that he was involved in involved himself and this other man.” 
      
       
     11 The Crown submissions acknowledge that an appropriate sentencing range might include a supervised recognizance. It is submitted, however, that the failure to record a conviction has the effect that there was no punitive aspect to the order of the Court and that it contained no relevant personal or general deterrence. 
      
       
     12 Authorities in this Court have established that the Crown can demonstrate manifest inadequacy where a discretion not to record a conviction under s10 is exercised. In R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83 the Court overturned an order under s10 and bearing in mind the principles of double jeopardy, imposed a suspended sentence for 2 years. In R v Lord [2001] NSWCCA 533 the Court overturned an order under s10 and substituted a suspended sentence of 18 months. 
      
       
     13 The Crown submission in this case is that the sentencing judge erred in making the findings of fact he did. On the other hand there was nothing unusual about the course taken at the sentence hearing. The respondent was called to give evidence to dispute the statement of facts which was tendered and having seen the respondent give evidence, having been informed of his background and having seen the video of the fighting in Dungate Lane, the judge made his findings. The respondent was relevantly cross-examined by the Crown only as to his having a bottle and why he had told the police another story. In my view the judge was entitled to make the findings of fact which he did. These findings of fact involved the judge concluding the respondent was only peripherally involved in what had happened and that he was as much a victim as he was a perpetrator. Section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out matters the Court must consider when exercising a discretion not to record a conviction. They are: 
      
       
     (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition; 
      
       
     (b) the trivial nature of the offence; 
      
       
     (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed; 
      
       
     (d) any other matter that the Court thinks proper to consider. 
      
       
     14 The sentencing judge did not consider the provisions of s10 in terms. He did, however, note the youth and antecedents of the prisoner which is relevant under paragraph (a). He did analyse the seriousness of the offence and characterise it as at the bottom of the scale which is relevant to paragraph (b). He did consider the extenuating circumstances which is relevant to paragraph (c).  
      
       
     15 Bearing in mind the unique position the sentencing judge was in to determine the facts in this case, in my view there is nothing to indicate he has committed any error in that regard. Having made the findings he did it was then up to him to consider the exercise of a discretion not to record a conviction under s10 of the Act. To exercise such a discretion for a criminal offence tried on indictment is not a common occurrence. Moreover, as the judge noted, this area of Sydney has an unfortunate history of violence and therefore there are strong public policy reasons for imposing sentences which reflect general deterrence. Having said that, however, I am not persuaded that in the circumstances of this case as they were found to be by the sentencing judge, it could be said that the orders of the judge are manifestly inadequate.  
      
       
     16 I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal. 
      
       
     17 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
      
       
     18 ADAMS J: I also agree. 
      
       
     19 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Scott Warren Hayes against the sentence imposed on him by English DCJ in the District Court at Gosford on 22 June 2001 following his plea of guilty to one count of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence which attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed by her Honour was imprisonment for a term of 4 years, commencing on 7 July 2001 with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
      
       
     2 The facts of the matter were that at about 8.20pm on Monday, 26 February 2001 the applicant and a co-offender, Joel Kenneth Griffin, were driving along The Entrance Road, Erina. They were long standing friends and the applicant was suffering the effects of heroin withdrawal. He asked the co-offender, who was driving the vehicle, to pull over to the side of the road near the Mobil Service Station. The applicant then entered the service station armed with a blood filled syringe and disguised by pulling a hood over his head which had eyeholes cut into it. During a subsequent interview the applicant stated that he had cut the holes in the hood and filled the syringe with blood earlier that evening in case he needed to do a robbery. 
      
       
     3 The applicant entered the service station and demanded cash from the console operator, using the syringe as a threat to the operator. The operator handed the applicant $300 and thereupon he quickly left the shop. He ran to where the co-offender was still waiting, got into the car and told the other man to go.  
      
       
     4 The applicant also said in the interview that he told the co-offender that he had just robbed the service station and to drive to a nearby caravan park in Avoca Drive so that he could hide the clothes he had used in the robbery. The co-offender did so, whereupon the applicant placed his clothes in a clothing bin at Green Point. They then drove to Forrester’s Beach where the applicant made a number of telephone calls to obtain heroin. 
      
       
     5 The following evening, again about 8.20pm, the offender and the co-offender were seen in the vehicle, the registration number of which had been taken the previous night by witnesses to the robbery. It was stopped by the police on The Entrance Road. The applicant and his co-offender were cautioned, taken to Gosford Police Station and interviewed where the applicant made full admissions. A search of the vehicle revealed a blood filled syringe which the applicant admitted in the interview would have been the one used.  
      
       
     6 Subsequently, on 29 May, the applicant made a further statement in which he further implicated the co-offender in the robbery. He also indicated that he was prepared to assist the police by giving evidence against the co-offender at the trial.  
      
       
     7 The applicant pleaded guilty when he first appeared in the Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902 and he adhered to his plea when he appeared in the District Court on 7 June 2001; his plea was therefore at the first available opportunity. When arrested on 27 February 2001 bail was refused but he was released on bail on 4 April 2001, 34 days later. He remained on bail until he appeared in the District Court on 7 June 2001 and had been in custody since that date. His sentence was backdated to commence on 7 June 2001 but he was not given any credit for the 34 days which he had earlier spent in custody.  
      
       
     8 He was at the time aged 25 years, being born on 17 May 1977. He had no previous convictions which were relevant to the sentencing in this matter. He left school with the school certificate at the end of year 10. He subsequently worked in a number of jobs, initially full time and subsequently part time, and had been unemployed for about a year at the time of his arrest.  
      
       
     9 The evidence showed that the applicant had been using cannabis since about age 16 or 17 and later also used amphetamines to the extent that he became a regular user. Then since about age 20 to 21 he had been using heroin. Over the couple of years prior to his arrest he had become a regular user and apparently an addict and had sold a number of his possessions to feed his habit. 
      
       
     10 His release on bail on 4 April 2001 was on condition that he undertake a drug rehabilitation course at Odyssey House or the William Booth Centre. No place was available at the William Booth Centre so he went to Odyssey House where he completed the initial detoxification program but about a week after completing that program, he left for reasons which her Honour found, and with which I agree, were most unsatisfactory. He returned home to Gosford but managed to find a friendly stranger at the railway station on the way with whom he shared a joint of cannabis.  
      
       
     11 His bail was varied to permit him to undertake the drug rehabilitation program at the William Booth Centre but after being there for about 2 weeks he was suspended, again for reasons which, although not drug related, did not help his case. He had returned home and had been re-accepted into the program, 1 or 2 days before the sentencing hearing. Her Honour found that the motivation for his drug rehabilitation came from the applicant’s parents rather than from the applicant himself, a view which on the evidence was open to her Honour.  
      
       
     12 Let me start by saying that for myself I cannot see any excessive severity in a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for an armed robbery by a 25 year old of a console operator in a service station at night where the instrument used to threaten the victim was a blood filled syringe. Whilst proper regard must be had to guideline judgments it must be borne in mind that they are, as they are called, guidelines and this point was emphasised in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [2] where the Chief Justice repeated what he had said in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Such guidelines are intended to be indicative only, they are not intended to be applied to every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing judges. Decisions of appellate courts on sentencing are not to be treated as binding precedents.” 
         
        
       
     13 It is, therefore, I believe a mistake to simply pick a figure within the range indicated by the appropriate guideline judgment and then, by accumulating a number of deductions and by a mathematical process, reach a figure which fails to reflect the seriousness of the offence or the need for general deterrence or the terror which may have been engendered in the victim.  
      
       
     14 In this case her Honour had regard to the judgment in Henry, noting that the applicant was not a young offender but aged 24, and he was without a prior criminal record, but she also noted the use of a syringe, a factor referred to by the Chief Justice in the subsequent case of R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at 72 as “more serious than the category of weapon considered in Henry.” 
      
       
     15 For those reasons her Honour apparently took something in excess of the starting point referred to in Henry. Unfortunately, she did not specify precisely what it was. She allowed a 15 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea: R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 305 and 30 percent for assistance to the authorities in the offer to give evidence against the co-offender. The latter discount I would regard as somewhat generous. But she also paid particular attention to the need for general deterrence of armed robberies by terrorising shop assistants and console operators to purchase drugs on the Central Coast, which she described as “endemic”, and the terror engendered in the victim who had no way of knowing whether he or she was going to be injured by a needle stick prick contaminated by HIV or hepatitis.  
      
       
     16 Her Honour had regard to all relevant matters, including the use of the syringe, the age of the applicant, his previous good record, the limited degree of planning, what she found was a genuine contrition, his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, but also the need for general deterrence and the protection of the community. 
      
       
     17 However, as I have already noted, her Honour did not specify what her starting point was and, having regard to the discounts allowed and the final result at which she arrived, it must have been something in excess of 7 years. Bearing in mind that R v Henry suggests a range of 4 to 5 years but that in this case there was the older age of the applicant, the use of the syringe and the particular need for general deterrence in the local area, with which her Honour was apparently familiar, I am satisfied that she was justified in going beyond that range. But it does, on consideration, appear to me that something in excess of 7 years was excessive and this, together with the failure to allow for the 34 days custody before being admitted to bail, constitutes error on the part of the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     18 In those circumstances, it becomes necessary for this Court to re-sentence. For myself, having regard to the matters of aggravation referred to, I would take a starting point of 6 years. I would not interfere with the discounts allowed by her Honour although, as I have said, I regard them to be somewhat generous, so allowing total discounts of 45 percent on a sentence of 6 years leaves one with a head sentence of approximately 3 years and 4 months. In my view, this would be an appropriate sentence for this offence in the circumstances. 
      
       
     19 Her Honour did not find that there were special circumstances. That finding was open to her Honour on the evidence before her, but as this Court is re-sentencing it is necessary for us to reconsider this aspect of the matter. 
      
       
     20 There are three matters which, in my view, taken together, do constitute special circumstances in this case; namely, that the applicant was in effect a first offender and this is his first time in gaol. He had already, although it would appear only by 1 day, started to seek drug rehabilitation prior to the commission of the offence, and he did make some effort although more could have been done between the time of his arrest and being sentenced for these matters in that regard. Moreover, we have the affidavit which he has sworn on 12 June setting out his progress in July and this shows what might be called an enthusiastic attempt to get his life in order.  
      
       
     21 I would, therefore find special circumstances and fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months.  
      
       
     22 I therefore, propose that this Court grant leave to appeal and uphold the appeal, quash the sentence imposed by her Honour and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a term of 3 years and 4 months, that sentence to be deemed to have commenced 34 days prior to 7 June 2001, which would be 3 May 2001. I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months.  
      
       
     23 The earliest date on which the applicant would therefore be eligible for release on parole would be 2 July 2003. 
      
       
     24 ADAMS J: I agree. 
      
       
     25 DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have indicated.

      REGINA v. MARIYA TERAGUCHI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Mariya Teraguchi, appears before me on a special hearing directed by the Attorney General under s.19 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act), s.19. That hearing is to be conducted as required by s.21 of that Act. 
     
      
    2 By virtue of s.21(3)(a), the accused is to be taken to have entered a plea of not guilty in respect of the offence charged. That offence charged is that she did on 24 June 2001 at Yagoona murder Ryoko Teraguchi. Upon the indictment being read to her she informed me that she did not murder Ryoko Teraguchi but did kill an imposter. 
     
      
    3 She has earlier been brought before Justice Barr in this court, the question of her fitness for trial having been raised and he determined, after a hearing conducted in accordance with the Act, that she was unfit for trial. It was in consequence of that determination that the Mental Health Review Tribunal assessed her fitness for trial, but determined that she would not be fit for trial within 12 months. 
     
      
    4 It was in consequence of that determination that the Attorney General gave the direction to which I have referred which has caused this special hearing to be brought before me. 
     
      
    5 The relevant requirements of s.21A of the Act and s.16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 were met in that an appropriate election by the accused on the advice of her lawyer and consented to by the Director for Public Prosecutions for trial by judge alone on the issues arising on the special hearing was made and filed. 
     
      
    6 I am required therefore on this hearing to conduct the hearing without a jury and to do so in accordance with s.21, and reach a verdict as prescribed by s.21B and s.22 of the Act. In particular, I am to have regard to s.25 of that Act since on the material with which I have been provided in evidence by the Crown, the defence of mental illness has been raised. 
     
      
    7 It will be necessary also for me to comply with s.17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These requirements have been examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision in Regina v. Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505. 
     
      
    8 I am obliged by law to set out the legal and practical consequence of the findings which are open on this special hearing. 
     
      
    9 If by reason of mental illness the appropriate course is there be a special verdict under s.25 then I am required to apply the particular provisions of the Act specifically as I would in the event that the defence of mental illness as provided for by s.38 is made out. 
     
      
    10 Section 37 of the Act requires me to refer to the fact that the Mental Health Review Tribunal is constituted under the Mental Health Act 1990, and has the functions under that Act with respect to forensic patients which included the function of making recommendation for a person detained in accordance with s.39 only if the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. 
     
      
    11 It is somewhat doubtful having regard to the matters which must be attended to prior to there being a special hearing, how appropriate it is for a judge sitting as a judge alone to explain in that judge's verdict, whether it be the verdict under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or that under the Act (if they should be different), what the functions and composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal are in consequence of a person having been brought before a special hearing with mental illness being raised. 
     
      
    12 Nonetheless having regard to what the High Court has said in Fleming v. The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379 and the views of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Zvonaric (supra), to which I have referred, I note that the legal and practical effect of the special verdict of mental illness is that, under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990, it will be necessary to order that the accused be detained in psychiatric custody in such a place and in such manner as seems fit until released by due process of law so that the accused would not return to the community except in accordance with the application of the provisions of the Mental Health Legislation. 
     
      
    13 The psychiatric custody would be in a place, which would be a psychiatric hospital gazetted under the Mental Health Act 1990. The accused would come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which consists of a President or Deputy President who has qualifications as a barrister or solicitor and two other members one of whom may be a psychiatrist and the other of whom having suitable qualifications and experience to serve on the body. 
     
      
    14 That Tribunal will review the case of the accused and make recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation could be either unconditional or subject to conditions. If the Tribunal was satisfied, that only if it was satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by her release it could be considered by the Department of Health, and in due course relevant advice furnished to the Governor. The Governor might then make orders in accordance with the recommendation and advice for the detention of the accused, or of his release conditional or unconditional. 
     
      
    15 The Governor could only make such an order if there be a recommendation by the Tribunal. The Tribunal can at any time - any six months - review the case of the accused and make appropriate recommendation to release. Release could be unconditional or conditional in its view to be made. The Tribunal is not free to consider any recommendation for release, and is satisfied the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by any release and any such recommendation could go to the Department of Health and the Minister to advise the Governor. 
     
      
    16 A breach of the conditions would warrant a return to custody and the Department would maintain a watch over the case with the assistance of psychiatrists and the Community Health Centre. 
     
      
    17 The only way in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purpose of these provisions is when unconditionally released. 
     
      
    18 I now turn to the evidence which was tendered to me by consent. The materials to which I had earlier referred were provided to me in a volume which became Exhibit D and which included the statement of the accused's father, he being an eye witness at the killing who gives evidence of the stabbing by the accused of the person named in the indictment in his presence. 
     
      
    19 There was also included the interview of the accused with police in which the accused admitted that stabbing, and that it was performed with intent to kill; that it was performed because the person the accused believed she was attacking, Mrs. Honda, had in the belief of the accused kidnapped her mother and was posing as her mother. 
     
      
    20 The factual material satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that since at least 1997 the accused had been suffering from a psychotic illness attended with auditory hallucinations and delusional ideas of a persecutory nature causing on her part odd and aggressive behaviour. She had been admitted as suffering that to Banks House to the psychiatric unit at Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital in 1997. Thereafter she had five admissions, the last being in August 1998. 
     
      
    21 Mr. Hill, her father, gives evidence that when first released from Banks House she manifested the belief that an imposter had taken the place of her mother. And on the 24 June 2001 when she had arrived at the home of Mr. Hill and the deceased he says he saw the dispute with her mother commence in discussions over the payment of a taxi fare, and proceeding through to the accused stabbing the deceased with a knife over and over again. 
     
      
    22 He attempted to telephone emergency services on a mobile phone at which time the accused was, in her view, speaking to or attempting to speak to her mother whom she believed was in Japan. When the police arrived the accused was formally cautioned. In addition to that she was advised by the attending police officer, ""It's probably best for you if you say nothing at the moment"". She said, ""No, no I want to tell you. This woman inside, she go to Japan and she have plastic surgery to look like my Mum and then she come here, but she not my Mum that's why I stab her.” 
     
      
    23 Again the constable advised her that she need not say anything about this, but she asked her father to come to her, and at that time was mumbling with inappropriate affect. She, in the hearing of other police referred to having killed the deceased and being glad she was dead because she was not her mother. 
     
      
    24 During the electronically recorded interview she told the police similar things. She said that she didn't know why she took the knife. ""It might be my spirit just came out of my body and forced me to take it, I don't know."" She expressed the view that she had intended to kill the imposter. And ""it's just it needed to be stopped. I killed her because I want to go back to Japan. I killed her because I want to leave hospital that's why I killed her.” 
     
      
    25 She informed the interviewing police that after she had put the knife down she rung her mother who was staying in Osaka, and informed her of the death of Mrs. Honda. 
     
      
    26 Tendered in evidence in documentary form were the diagnosis of Dr Ali, psychiatrist who had diagnosed the accused as suffering from a psychotic illness in 1997; and that of Dr. Fosbrooke, psychiatrist who had been involved in the treatment of the accused since 10 July 2000. Dr. Fosbrooke in particular noted that during the 11 month treatment of the accused she had never been free of the symptoms of psychosis, although the extent of manifested symptoms had fluctuated and improved with treatment. 
     
      
    27 There was also tendered in evidence the opinion of Dr. Brian Boettcher, consultant psychiatrist who had treated the accused after she had been remanded in custody at Bunya medium security unit of Cumberland Hospital. He noted that her condition was a particular psychosis which has been referred to as Capgras Syndrome, an unusual treatment resistant and dangerous variant of chronic paranoid schizophrenia. 
     
      
    28 Dr. Olav Nielssen similarly diagnosed the accused, as did Dr. Bruce Westmore. The expert medical opinion concerning the accused is thus unanimous that at the time of the acts causing death, the accused suffered from a defect of reason from disease of the mind manifesting in delusions which deprived the accused either of the capacity to know that she ought not to do the act in question, or that what she was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    29 The defence at law of mental illness is made out if it should appear more probable than not on the whole of the evidence in the case that at the time of the act causing death the state of mind of the accused involved such a defect of reason arising from disease of the mind. 
     
      
    30 Mere excitability, lack of self-control or impulsiveness are quite different things from such a defect of reason. What is required for the defence to be made out is a disorder of understanding and reasoning, or a disorder of the functioning of the mind. If the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act, or if having that knowledge the accused did not know that the act was wrong in the sense that an ordinary reasonable person understands right and wrong, that is to say where such a person may be disabled from reasoning with a moderate degree of composure and sense as to the right and wrong of what he or she was doing, then the defence is made out. 
     
      
    31 Having regard to the matters to which I am directed by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the Act, I find that it is established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused killed the deceased named in the indictment, with intent to kill. But, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities by the uncontested evidence of the psychiatrists, which is unanimous on this issue that at the time in question the accused suffered from a mental illness so as not to be responsible in law for her actions so that it is required of me to return the special verdict under s.25 of the Act. 
     
      
    32 Therefore, I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness, and order that she be detained in the Bunya Medium Secured Unit, Cumberland Hospital, or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
        
       
     1 HEYDON JA: The first two defendants below have filed a Summons seeking leave to appeal against an order of English DCJ made on 30 January 2002 dismissing a Notice of Motion filed by them on 29 June 2001. Judgment was delivered orally, but had been reserved after a hearing on 28 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 On 29 April 2002 Handley JA refused a stay, but he ordered that the application for leave and the appeal be heard concurrently. Accordingly this Court was prepared today to hear full argument, to the intent that if leave were granted the appeal could be disposed of. 
      
       
     3 The plaintiff below is the executrix of the will of Laurence John Martin, who died in 1999. The first and second defendants are solicitors who were allegedly engaged by Mr Martin to commence proceedings on his behalf to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by him in an accident on or about 10 October 1998. The third defendant is another solicitor allegedly engaged for that purpose during 1997, but he sought no relief in the Notice of Motion and the outcome of this application for leave does not affect him. 
      
       
     4 The history is as follows. 
      
       
     5 On or about 10 October 1988 Mr Martin allegedly crossed a street in Manly and was struck by a motor vehicle. He allegedly suffered various injuries including a fractured hip. 
      
       
     6 According to a portion of page 5 of the Statement of Claim, which wrongly appears under the heading “Particulars of Economic Loss”, but was doubtless, like all the other paragraphs on page 5 except the first two, intended to have been, and should have been, pleaded as a separate allegation of material fact, on 9 November 1988 Mr Martin retained the first two defendants to commence proceedings on his behalf to recover damages to compensate him for the injuries he suffered in the accident. The first and second defendants have denied this in their Defence, but a Chronology which they used below and have supplied to this Court stated that the “plaintiff” (scilicet Mr Martin) retained them “re motor vehicle accident”.  
      
       
     7 On 28 June 1990 the first and second defendants filed a Statement of Claim on Mr Martin’s behalf in the District Court. The proceedings bore the number 9605 of 1990. The Statement of Claim named the Nominal Defendant as the defendant. In various respects the plaintiff in these proceedings contends that the first and second defendants were negligent as to the conduct of those proceedings; in particular it is alleged that those proceedings were commenced against the wrong defendant. 
      
       
     8 On 1 July 1992, the plaintiff contends, and the primary judge said, that the limitation period in relation to the plaintiff’s accident expired. The first and second defendants say it may well have expired earlier, but it is not necessary to explore what the true position is.  
      
       
     9 On 24 April 1995 proceedings came before the District Court. Why they did, and why they were stood over for one month, is unclear.  
      
       
     10 On 25 May 1995, according to paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim in these proceedings, proceedings number 9605 of 1990 were “struck out and/or dismissed for want of prosecution”. The first and second defendants in their Defence did not admit this. However, they now contend that this happened on 24 May 1995. The trial judge said that it happened on 24 May 1995. The plaintiff now says in written submissions to this Court that it is agreed that the relevant event happened on 24 May 1995. Handley JA on 29 April 2002 was told that the judge was Garling DCJ and that is confirmed by material handed to the Court this morning. There is no copy or evidence before this Court of any reasons he delivered, nor of the precise order he made. 
      
       
     11 According to the first and second defendants’ Chronology, in late 1996 they ceased to act for the plaintiff; the third defendant was instructed by Mr Martin to act in January 1997; the third defendant ceased to act for Mr Martin in September 1997; and in September 1997 the solicitors presently acting for the plaintiff began to act for Mr Martin. The primary judge made statements to this general effect which were less precise as to time.  
      
       
     12 On 19 May 1998 Mr Martin’s new solicitors filed a Notice of Motion dated 18 May 1998 seeking an order for the dismissal of the Statement of Claim which Garling DCJ had already dealt with, and for leave to file a fresh Statement of Claim against a person named as the driver of the motor vehicle which injured the plaintiff and a person alleged to be the owner of that motor vehicle. 
      
       
     13 On 1 July 1998, according to the first and second defendants, but not the plaintiff, the limitation period relating to any cause of action which Mr Martin had against the first and second defendants expired, if it had not expired earlier.  
      
       
     14 On 3 July 1998 the Notice of Motion filed on 19 May 1998 was dismissed. The primary judge said this happened on 18 May 1998, which must be a slip since it was not filed until the next day. The judge who dismissed it was Dodd DCJ. Counsel for the first and second defendants informed Handley JA on 29 April 2002 that a copy of his judgment was supplied to English DCJ and had not been seen since, and that the tape of what was said on 3 July 1998 has been destroyed. However, counsel for the first two defendants was able to hand to the Court this morning a recently located copy of the judgment.  
      
       
     15 On 26 April 1999, according to the primary judge, Mr Martin died. 
      
       
     16 On 24 May 2001 the plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim in relation to Mr Martin’s complaints against the defendants. The proceedings were numbered 99 of 2001. The Statement of Claim named as the driver of the motor vehicle which injured Mr Martin “Sonasi Taungahava”.  
      
       
     17 By a Defence dated 27 June 2001, the first and second defendants alleged that the plaintiff’s claim “is barred and not maintainable pursuant to s 14 of the Limitation Act … .”  
      
       
     18 The primary judge described the contentions of the plaintiff and the first two defendants, and her decision about them, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The executrix alleges that due to the negligent manner in which the defendants brought the proceedings by incorrectly naming the defendant as the nominal defendant and by failing to comply with the orders of the Court the deceased’s claim was dismissed. Critical to this application is when the limitation period began to run. The first and second defendants assert that the limitation period commenced to run on 1 July 1992 when the limitation period expired under the Motor Accidents Act. However, the executrix asserts that the limitation period against the first and second defendants does not expire until six years after the allegations of negligence alleged against them. The Statement of Claim was not struck out until 24 May 1995. The allegations of negligence alleged as against the first and second defendant did not solidify until the Statement of Claim was struck out on that day, they being failure to properly prosecute the proceedings, failure to comply with court directions in relation to the proceedings and failure to amend the name of the defendant. 
         
        
        
         
         The current Statement of Claim was filed on [24] May 2001 and the plaintiff argues the proceedings are therefore not statute barred. The general rule as to the statute barring of actions for professional negligence are well settled. A cause of action accrues from when it is complete and the plaintiff has suffered measurable damage in professional negligence cases. This generally occurs when the original action becomes statute barred. The exception to the general rule operates when the very act of negligence that inflicts the injury also has the effect of precluding the commencement of an action. 
         
        
        
         
         In the [present] case the executrix asserts that the first and second defendants did commence proceedings within the limitation period, however their conduct and management of those proceedings were negligent and that negligence continued in the conduct and the management of the proceedings up unto and including 24 May 1995 when the proceedings were struck out. It has been submitted on behalf of the executrix that the decisions relied upon by the applicants to the Motion, decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal have dealt only with the situations where solicitors failed to commence proceedings within the relevant limitation period and this matter can therefore be distinguished. 
         
        
        
         
         There is much merit to that submission. The Statement of Claim was filed within time. However, due to the negligence of solicitors the incorrect defendant was named. When the matter came before the District Court on 24 April 1995 there was an appearance on behalf of the deceased Mr Martin. The notation on the Court file records ‘Note: NOM DEF SUED BUT DEF DRIVER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED’. It is not clear why the matter was then stood over for one month. Presumably, however, it was to allow an application to be made to name the correct defendants, who of course were known, as Sonasi Taungakava [sic] and Sita Fua, however nothing was done. The solicitors could have applied to the Court under Part 17 Rule 3 to amend the Statement of Claim. Clearly they failed to do so and as a result the claim was struck out pursuant to Part 6 Rule 5(b). This of course is not a scenario as envisaged by Sperling J in [Wilson v Rigg [2000] NSWSC 16], a case relied upon by the defendants. 
         
        
        
         
         The act of negligence by the solicitors brought about the striking out of the Statement of Claim and these acts of negligence manifested themselves on 24 May 1995. The act of negligence was not failing to file the Statement of Claim within time, but rather nominating an incorrect defendant and then not correcting that error when on notice to do so. This is not the unreasonable result as envisaged by Sperling J or an unintended result of the legislation. It is in my view clearly a case of negligence on the part of the first and second defendant, as a consequence of which the executrix of the estate of the late Laurence Martin has suffered damage as a result of the breaches by the solicitors. 
         
        
        
         
         The limitation period against the first and second defendants is six years in accordance with the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Limitations Act. The Statement of Claim in these proceedings was filed on [24] May 2001 and the proceedings are therefore not statute barred.”  
         
        
        
       
     19 In that passage several apparent errors have been corrected.  
      
       
     20 The reference to the plaintiff coming on notice of the error about naming an incorrect defendant appears to be a reference to the fact that the solicitors for Mr Martin received a letter of 9 April 1998 from the solicitor for the Nominal Defendant. Under cover of that letter was supplied a Police Traffic Collision Report (“the P4”) naming as the driver the person now named in the Statement of Claim in these proceedings. That letter is referred to in, and the Report is annexed to, an affidavit of the plaintiff’s solicitor dated 18 May 1998 used in support of the Notice of Motion dated 18 May 1998 and filed on 19 May 1998.  
      
       
     21 Section 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of six years running from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff or to a person through whom the plaintiff claims - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) a cause of action founded on contract (including quasi contract) not being a cause of action founded on a deed; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a cause of action founded on tort, including a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty… .” 
         
        
       
     22 The primary judge said, speaking of the period 24 April-24 May 1995, that the first and second defendants could have applied to the court under Part 17 rule 3 to amend the Statement of Claim. Part 17 rule 3 of the District Court Rules in the form they took throughout the period 28 June 1990 (when the Statement of Claim was filed in the first proceeding) to 24 May 1995 (when Garling DCJ made an order about it) does not appear centrally relevant. However, Part 17 rules 1-4 provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. (1) The Court may, at any stage of any proceedings, on the application of any party or without any such application, order, on terms, that any document in the proceedings be amended, or that any party have leave to amend any document filed by him in the proceedings, in either case in such manner as the Court thinks fit. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceedings, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings, or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
          (3) Where there has been a mistake in the name of a party, subrule (1) applies to the person intended to be made a party as if he were a party. 
         
        
        
         
          (4) This rule does not apply to the amendment of a judgment order or certificate. 
         
        
        
         
         2. (1) A party may, without leave, amend any pleading of his once at any time before a praecipe for trial is filed in the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
          (1A) A party pleading may, subject to subrule (1B), by consent of the parties amend the pleading at any stage of the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
          (1B) Subrule (1A) does not apply to an amendment which would have the effect that a person is added as, is substituted for, or ceases to be, a party. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) Where a plaintiff amends his statement of claim - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (a) if the defendant has served notice of his grounds of defence, he may amend the notice; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (b) the plaintiff shall not be entitled to have default judgment entered up, or an order for judgment made, in the action before the expiry of 28 days after service on the defendant of the statement of claim or 14 days after service on the defendant under rule 9, whichever expires later. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (3) The rights to amend subrules (1A) and (2) are in addition to the right to amend under subrule (1). 
         
        
        
         
          (4) Where the following is the order of events - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (a) a party (in this subrule called the first party) files a pleading (in this subrule called the first pleading); 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (b) an opposite party files a pleading (in this subrule called the second pleading) in answer to the first pleading; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          (c) the first party amends the first pleading;  
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (d) the opposite party does not amend the second pleading within the time allowed by this rule, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          then - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (e) the second pleading shall have effect as a pleading in answer to the amended first pleading; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (f) Part 9 rule 15 (2) shall not apply, but, if no further pleading between those parties is filed, there shall be, at the expiration of the time mentioned in paragraph (d), an implied joinder of issue on the second pleading. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         3. (1) Where a party amends his pleading under rule 2(1), the Court, on application by an opposite party, may, on terms, but subject to subrule (2), by order disallow the amendment. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) Notice of a motion under subrule (1) shall be filed and served within fourteen days after the date of service on the applicant under rule 9. 
         
        
        
         
          (3) Where, on the hearing of an application under subrule (1), the Court is satisfied that, if an application for leave to make the amendment had been made under rule 1(1) on the date on which the amendment was made under rule 2(1) the Court would not have given leave to make the whole or some part of the amendment, the Court shall disallow the amendment or that part, as the case may be. 
         
        
        
         
         4. (1) Where any relevant period of limitation expires after the date of filing of a statement of claim and after that expiry an application is made under rule 1 for leave to amend the statement of claim by making the amendment mentioned in any of subrules (2), (3), (4) and (5), the Court may in the circumstances mentioned in that subrule make an order giving leave accordingly, notwithstanding that that period has expired. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) Where notice of a motion for leave to make an amendment is filed within fourteen days after the date of filing the statement of claim, the Court may give leave to make the amendment, whatever the nature of the amendment may be. 
         
        
        
         
          (3) Where there has been a mistake in the name of a party and the Court is satisfied that the mistake was not misleading nor such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, the Court may make an order for leave to make an amendment to correct the mistake, whether or not the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party. 
         
        
        
         
          (4) Where, on or after the date of filing a statement of claim, the plaintiff is or becomes entitled to sue in any capacity, the Court may order that the plaintiff have leave to make an amendment having the effect that he sues in that capacity. 
         
        
        
         
          (5) Where a plaintiff, in his statement of claim, makes a claim on a cause of action arising out of any facts, the Court may order that he have leave to make an amendment having the effect of adding or substituting a new cause of action arising out of the same or substantially the same facts and a claim on that new cause of action. 
         
        
        
         
          (6) This rule does not limit the powers of the Court under rule 1.” 
         
        
       
     23 Part 6 rule 5(b) appears never to have existed, and it seems that nothing in Part 6 has anything to do with the case. It may be that when the primary judge mentioned Part 6 rule 5(b), she meant Part 18 rule 3. Between 28 June 1990 and 17 February 1995 it provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where a plaintiff does not within a reasonable time take any step necessary to bring any proceedings to trial, or unreasonably takes any step to avoid the proceedings being brought to trial, the Court may, on the application of the defendant, order on terms that the proceedings be dismissed or make such other order as the Court thinks fit. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Where proceedings are dismissed under subrule (1), rules 6, 7 and 8 apply as though the dismissal were a discontinuance.” 
         
        
       
     24 After 17 February 1995 and beyond 25 May 1995 it provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where a plaintiff does not within a reasonable time take any step necessary to bring any proceedings to trial, or unreasonably takes any step to avoid the proceedings being brought to trial, the Court may, on the application of the defendant or of its own motion, order on terms that the proceedings be dismissed or make such other order as the Court thinks fit. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Where proceedings are dismissed under subrule (1), rules 6, 7 and 8 apply as though the dismissal were a discontinuance. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The Court may not make an order under subrule (1) without giving the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to be heard. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The Court may, on application by any party, set aside an order that is made on the Court’s own motion under subrule (1).” 
         
        
       
     25 The rule relied on in the Notice of Motion which the primary judge dismissed was Part 11A rule 3. It provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious; or 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the Court, 
          
          
         the Court may order that the proceedings be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     26 The Statement of Claim alleges that the first defendant and the second defendant were negligent. A cause of action in negligence is not complete until the victim has suffered actual damage, as distinct from damage which is only negligible, non-measurable, prospective or contingent: Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302 at [13]-[14]. The particularised damage, as set out in paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim, is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The loss of entitlement to claim non economic loss, economic loss, out of pocket expenses, future out of pocket expenses and domestic assistance for the injuries and disabilities suffered as a result of the said motor vehicle collision which occurred on the 10th October 1998 … .” 
         
        
       
     27 A “loss of entitlement to claim” may not be complete until all prospects of making that claim are irretrievably destroyed. In assessing whether any negligence by the first and second defendant had caused Mr Martin actual damage before 24 May 1995, it would be useful to know: 
      
       
        
       (a) Whether, for the purposes of Part 17 rule 2(1), a praecipe for trial had been filed: if it had not, Mr Martin had an untrammelled right to amend to join the correct defendant right up to 24 May 1995, subject to Part 17 rule 3.  
        
        
       (b) Whether the court acted on its own motion on 24 May 1995: for if it did, Mr Martin could have moved later to set aside the order made that day.  
        
        
       (c) What grounds, if any, were advanced by the Nominal Defendant for the order made on 24 May 1995, what notice had been given of those grounds to Mr Martin, what delay in relation to any particular step necessary to bring the proceedings to trial Mr Martin by himself or by the first and second defendants had been responsible for, what complaints the Nominal Defendant had made about delays, and what reasoning Garling DCJ used to arrive at the conclusion that the order of 24 May 1995 should be made: all these matters were relevant to whether just before that order was made, Mr Martin’s interests in making a claim had been irretrievably affected.  
        
       
     28 This Court has before it no evidence, and no material from the District Court file, which would enable any of these factual questions to be answered. 
      
       
     29 In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 the High Court dealt with the operation of s 82(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which at that time created a three year limitation period for damages actions under that Act. French J had struck out the Statement of Claim as statute-barred; the Full Federal Court allowed an appeal; and the High Court dismissed an appeal. At 533 Mason CJ, Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ used the following language, which, though uttered in a s 82(2) case, is of general application, and has been much applied since: 
      
       
        
         
         “We should, however, state in the plainest of terms that we regard it as undesirable that limitation questions of the kind under consideration should be decided in interlocutory proceedings in advance of the hearing of the action, except in the clearest of cases. Generally speaking, in such proceedings, insufficient is known of the damage sustained by the plaintiff and of the circumstances in which it was sustained to justify a confident answer to the question.” 
         
        
       
     30 At first instance in that case, French J described the applications before him as follows (State of Western Australia v Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd (1991) 28 FCR 68 at 71): 
      
       
        
         
         “The amended statement of claim was filed on 14 January. On 21 January, BCH filed a motion to strike it out in its entirety as disclosing no reasonable cause of action and alternatively for orders that pars 12(a)(i), 29(a) and (c), 33(b)(i) and 49 be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or for their tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings.  
         
        
        
         
         On 23 January, Connell filed a further motion seeking a dismissal of the application generally, alternatively as against himself, and alternatively the striking out of the amended statement of claim as against himself.” 
         
        
        
       He, and the High Court, were thus considering the application of provisions in the Federal Court Rules corresponding to some degree with Part 11A rule 3.  
        
       
     31 To use the words of the majority in the High Court, this is not the clearest of cases, and insufficient is known of the damage which Mr Martin allegedly sustained at the hands of the first and second defendants and the circumstances in which it was sustained to justify a confident answer to the question whether the proceedings were statute-barred. The condition of ignorance in which this Court has been left does not appear to be significantly different from the condition of ignorance in which the first and second defendants left the primary judge. Her reasons for judgment do not suggest that she had anything casting useful light on the course of events up to 24 May 1995. She had the Chronology (Exhibit B). She also had Exhibit A – the Notice of Motion filed on 19 May 1998 with an affidavit in support, together with the recently located copy of Dodd DCJ’s reasons for judgment. The only pre 24 May 1995 matters which the affidavit deals with are a letter dated 21 February 1991 from the Motor Accidents Authority indicating that GIO Australia Ltd would deal with Mr Martin’s claim, a letter from GIO Australia Ltd dated 21 March 1991 requesting particulars of loss, and a reply from the first and second defendants dated 10 May 1991. Apart from the material mentioned by her in the passage quoted above in relation to the notation on the District Court file made on 24 April 1995, the primary judge refers to nothing from the file.  
      
       
     32 Dodd DCJ’s recently located judgment of 3 July 1998 shows only that Mr Martin claimed to have attempted to contact his solicitors occasionally in 1990 and 1991 but found it difficult, that he did not contact his solicitors after 1991 and that on 28 June 1991 the first and second defendants provided to the GIO a copy of a Medicare printout, giving the names of the large number of doctors consulted by him apparently in relation to the injuries arising from the accident. Even with this supplementation the materials do not make it possible to assess confidently whether the proceedings were statute barred. 
      
       
     33 In oral argument before this Court, Mr Colefax, who appeared for the first and second defendants, contended that from the very outset when the wrong defendant was named in the Statement of Claim filed in 1990, Mr Martin was never going to be able to succeed against that defendant. Everything that has happened thereafter consisted simply of a series of events happening along a continuum. A significant amount of damage was sustained when the wrong defendant was joined and the limitation period began to run from that date in 1990. 
      
       
     34 In the course of debate with the Bench, Mr Colefax submitted that it was negligent of his clients not to have obtained the P4 from the police and there was evidence before the primary judge that the police had compiled a P4 on the very day of the accident. It was pointed out that there was no evidence to suggest that the first and second defendants had not tried to obtain the P4 and Mr Colefax accepted that was so.  
      
       
     35 Even assuming in favour of Mr Colefax’s submissions that there was negligence in 1990 on the part of the first and second defendants, there is the possibility that there was an available chance in periods from late May 1995 onwards of remedying the defect occasioned by the postulated negligence of the first and second defendants in 1990. The Statement of Claim is drafted in language wide enough to cover an allegation that there was in that latter period negligence in not exploiting that chance. In that event, the cause of action for that act of negligence is not barred. Neither below nor here have the first or second defendants been able to exclude that possibility. 
      
       
     36 The submissions made orally to the Court this morning raise factual questions. It is essentially a factual question whether one characterises events after 1990 as being part of a continuum of linked acts flowing from the original negligence, or whether one characterises them as divisible. Those factual questions cannot be answered on the state of the materials before this Court and the primary judge. 
      
       
     37 In short, the primary judge arrived at the correct order, though for reasons different from those she gave. It is not necessary to examine the arguments of the parties as to the correctness of her reasons. Since the order she made is correct, leave should not be granted to appeal against it. 
      
       
     38 This application raises one point of practice. The Claimants’ Summary of Argument asked for an order that the leave application be heard concurrently with the appeal. It was filed after Handley JA had made an order on 29 April 2002 to that effect, but subject to the views of the members of the court conducting the hearing. It is incumbent on a claimant who seeks an order of that kind to prepare a White Book which is suitable for use on the appeal, and written submissions corresponding in quality to those which are expected of an appellant. It would be unusual for an order for a concurrent hearing to be made where the materials to be examined were bulky: concurrent hearings are appropriate where the hearing of the appeal will not consume much more time than the hearing of the leave application. In the ordinary case, after an order for a concurrent hearing is made, the White Book and the submissions in it should be reviewed so that if necessary they can be supplemented in a manner and by a time which is not prejudicial to the opponent. The first and second defendants, when they came before Handley JA on 29 April 2002, had not filed a White Book, because at that stage they only filed a Holding Summons: what they sought was a stay. Handley JA refused a stay, granted expedition, and made directions. One of the directions was that the White Book be filed by 10 May 2002 “complete”. Part 51 rule 4B(1)(g) of the Supreme Court Rules requires the White Book, in cases where the claimant wants a concurrent hearing, to contain “the necessary documents for the appeal”. A letter from the Registrar to the claimants dated 20 May 2002 reminded them of that rule, and said that any necessary documents should be filed and served by 3 June. In fact the White Book is in a sense not “complete”. There is also a sense in which it does not contain all the “necessary” documents. It contains very little useful evidence, and very little useful material from the District Court file – though perhaps that was excusable, since nothing more was before the primary judge. The written submissions, to the extent that they are intelligible, do no more than indicate the ultimate conclusions which the claimants wish the Court to reach, but do not indicate why it should. The White Book also lacks something which, if it had contained it, would have saved the court a great deal of time, namely, copies of the material District Court Rules in the form they stood at the relevant time. The statutory provisions affecting the whole field of personal injuries law, and the procedural rules of the District Court which govern litigation relating to personal injuries, are so frequently amended that it is often difficult to be sure which are relevant. Whether or not material of that character strictly falls within the language of Part 51 rule 4B(1)(d), (g) or (h), it is desirable for parties to appeals to be aware before the hearing of what each contends are the appropriate enactments to be considered. It is also very valuable for this Court, which can only avoid unnecessary delay if it has prior notice of what the precise structure created by the relevant enactments is said by the parties to be.  
      
       
     39 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       1. The Summons is dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The claimants are to pay the opponent’s costs. 
        
       
     40 HODGSON JA: I agree. It appears quite probable that the only claim which the first opponent may have against the claimants is a claim for the loss of whatever chance the late Mr Martin may have had as at late May 1995 and thereafter to obtain such amendment and/or extension of time under the Motor Accidents Act as necessary to enable him to proceed against the correct defendant. 
      
       
     41 Should this chance ultimately be assessed as a small one, the first opponent would recover at most an appropriately small proportion of the value of Mr Martin’s cause of action. 
      
       
     42 However, in circumstances where this claim, albeit it possibly a small one, is not excluded, it is not shown that the primary judge was incorrect to dismiss the claimant’s application to dismiss the proceedings. 
      
       
     43 CAMPBELL AJA: I agree with the orders proposed and with the judgments of Heydon JA and Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     44 HEYDON JA: Accordingly, the orders are that the summons is dismissed and the claimants are to pay the opponent’s costs.45 COLEFAX: Before your Honours adjourn, could I just have an indulgence?46 HEYDON JA: Certainly.47 COLEFAX: Your Honour Heydon JA made some criticisms of the White Book. That criticism should be not directed at my instructing solicitors. For the record, I take responsibility for it. 48 HEYDON JA: They weren’t absolute criticisms, because it’s not entirely clear that they were outside the rules or even Handley JA’s order but what you’ve said--49 COLEFAX: Whether it be criticism or not your Honour, I accept responsibility for it, not my solicitors.50 HEYDON JA: What you’ve said is noted.

      REGINA v. CHRISTIAAN DOUGLAS ENDERBURY 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is a trial of two offences charged in an indictment against the accused. Those offences are (1) that he did on 15 August 2000 at Ashfield murder his father, Keith Enderbury; and, (2) that on 15 August 2000 at Ashfield by means of fire he did maliciously damage property at Unit 5, 5 Benalla Avenue, intending by that damage to cause bodily injury to Keith Enderbury. 
     
      
    2 The trial has proceeded in accordance with s.16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as a trial by judge alone, the formalities for the necessary election having been completed and I being satisfied of the relevant matters to which the section speaks. 
     
      
    3 It is necessary, therefore, that I reach a verdict in accordance with s.17 of that Act which provides that in trying these proceedings I may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person and my finding has for all purposes the same effect as the verdict of a jury. 
     
      
    4 My judgment is required by s.17(2) to include the principles of law applied by me and the findings of fact upon which I rely. 
     
      
    5 The case has proceeded upon the basis that the accused person is fit to give such consents and make such admissions as might be necessary to have the proceedings dealt with as they have been by consent by the provision to me by the Crown of Exhibit A, a folder containing the statements of witnesses and the reports of doctors, together with a Crown case outline which has been given publicly in the proceedings. 
     
      
    6 Counsel appearing for the accused has submitted, as has the Crown Prosecutor, that I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission by the accused of the offences charged and all elements of them but that I should in addition be satisfied on the balance of probabilities on the unanimous evidence of three investigating psychiatrists and two treating psychiatrists that the accused had available to him and established at least on the balance of probabilities the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    7 Having regard in particular to the evidence of Mr. Thomas Farrell, as well as the admissions made by the accused to the police who attended the scene and later during the recorded interview, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all matters of fact necessary to support the two charges. 
     
      
    8 Having regard to the evidence provided to me by way of report from Dr. Munro, Dr. Greenway, Dr. Nielssen, Dr. Lucas and Dr. Skinner I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the doing of the acts constituting the offence the accused was suffering from mental illness so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions at the time when the act was done. 
     
      
    9 I am required therefore to consider in that regard the matters to which s.37 of the Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act 1990 refers, that is to say, I must set out in my judgment as provided by s.17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by way of reference to the relevant principles of law the legal and practical consequences of the finding of an accused not guilty on the ground of mental illness. 
     
      
    10 The verdict must be returned in accordance with the law and the facts as found. In the event of an accused person having been found to be not guilty on the ground of mental illness I am required by law to make an order that the accused be detained in strict custody in such place and in such manner as seems fit until released by due process of law. 
     
      
    11 Such an order would in this case require that the accused be detained in an appropriate psychiatric institution. That would involve the continued detention of the accused in an appropriate psychiatric institution until release and that the accused will after such an order come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal which consists of a president whose deputy must be a lawyer. The Tribunal would be constituted by two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, the third of whom is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task. 
     
      
    12 It would be the function of that Tribunal to review the accused’s case as soon as practicable and make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the accused’s continued detention, care or treatment. Only if satisfied that the safety of the accused or that of any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by the accused’s release may the Tribunal make a recommendation for release. 
     
      
    13 If there was such a recommendation it would go to the Minister for Health who must then notify the Attorney General and furnish a copy of that notification to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    14 In the event there should be no objection to a recommendation for release within 30 days after the notification by the Minister for Health an order may be made for the accused’s release providing that the Minister for Police and Emergency Services is informed of the potential release, otherwise the Tribunal continues the supervision of the detention, care or treatment of the accused in a place and manner specified by the Tribunal. 
     
      
    15 The Tribunal must at least once every six months again review the case and make recommendations concerning the accused’s continued detention, care and treatment in hospital, prison or other place and as to his release and must review the case and make a recommendation to the Minister for Health if requested to do so by the Minister, the Attorney General, the Minister for Corrective Services, the Chief Health Officer or a Medical Superintendent of a hospital. No release may be recommended unless the Tribunal is satisfied as to the safety of the accused or any member of the public. 
     
      
    16 Were there to be release ordered then it may be on conditions or unconditionally. In the event of any breach of conditions or where the mental condition of the accused deteriorates so that he may be a danger a further order may be made for his apprehension, care and detention. Security conditions as necessary would continue whilst the accused is detained. 
     
      
    17 It is only where the relevant requirements of the legislation and the Tribunal have been met that a person may be released or having been released may be no longer subject to the restrictions that had been placed on that person concerning release. 
     
      
    18 In those circumstances I conclude that the special verdict provided for by s.38 is all that is available to me in this case to reach having regard to the unanimous and uncontested evidence. 
     
      
    19 Before, however, pronouncing the order required by s.39 I should refer to the immense tragedy that has overtaken this family as a consequence not of the accused’s conscious behaviour but of his suffering from an illness which over the years has been observed by medical practitioners prior to the commission of these offences and plainly diagnosed, after them. 
     
      
    20 When such things happen, as they do, and matters such as this come before this court it is always an occasion of tragedy and regret. 
     
      
    21 In making the formal legal orders required for the disposition of the case one cannot shut one’s eyes to that disposition being required by law in circumstances of such grave human tragedy. 
     
      
    22 That said, having regard to the admissions and consents that have been made and particularly as both counsel submit to me the order is proper I find the accused, Christiaan Douglas Enderbury, not guilty of the two offences charged by reason of mental illness. He is to be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at the Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

      BLANCH AJ 14 June 2002 REGINA v Thi Phuong LE JUDGMENT1 ADAMS J: I will ask Blanch J to give the first judgment.2 BLANCH J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on 22 February 2002. The applicant stood trial on a charge of knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act between 14 and 24 May 2001. She was convicted and on 22 February 2002, sentenced to nine and a half years imprisonment, to commence on 13 April 2000, with a non-parole period of five years and four months, to expire on 12 August 2005.3 The applicant was involved in the commission of the offence with three other co-offenders. The first was Tuan Ba Pham, who entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to ten years and six months imprisonment, to date from 13 April 2000, with a non-parole period of seven years and 11 months, to expire on 12 March 2008. He was granted leave to appeal against this sentence in this Court, but the appeal was dismissed on 13 August 2001. The second co-offender was The Anh Nguyen, who entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. He has lodged an application for leave to appeal against his sentence, but that application has still not come before the Court, although he was sentenced on 20 April 2001. The third co-offender is alleged to be a man, Cuong, who has not been arrested.4 The amount of the heroin involved was 2,103.5 grams. On analysis, the substance was found to contain 893 grams of pure heroin. The sale initiated was for six blocks of heroin, each weighing 12.5 ounces at $51,000 per block. It was estimated the heroin had a street value of $2.1 million, but the sentencing judge accepted that as a vague estimate. 
     5 In the appeal of Pham, Wood CJ at CL, summarised the facts as follows: 
      
       
       “3. The offences were detected during a targeted NCA operation, and involved a somewhat sophisticated and well organised criminal venture on the part of those involved. It is common ground that the offender occupying the highest rung in the distribution chain was a person Cuong, known by the honorific 'Uncle'. It was he who initially held the drugs, and it was from him that the others took instructions. However, both the applicant and a co-offender, Nguyen, were significantly involved in the operation, being persons described by his Honour as 'secondary principals'. This was a term of somewhat uncertain meaning and of dubious value. However, it can be taken to mean that these two offenders were the persons entrusted with authority to arrange the sale of drugs and to effect their delivery once a sale had been negotiated. 
        
        
       4. In the case of the applicant, his involvement began in Melbourne, where he met a covert operative, Alex, on 4 April 2000, and offered to him six blocks of heroin, each of 12.5 
         
       ounces, for sale in Sydney. A price of $51,000 per block was negotiated between the applicant and Alex. Arrangements were made for a meeting in Sydney. That meeting took place at the Star City Casino on 12 April 2000. It was attended by the applicant, by Alex and by another covert operative, Dat. 
        
        
       5. On this occasion, Alex and Dat showed the applicant $200,000 in bank notes in a sports bag. The applicant gave to Alex three paper packets containing the two small quantities of heroin (one being white in colour and one beige), and the small quantity of methylamphetamine, which were respectively, the 
         
       subject of the three lesser supply charges. They were offered as samples, the applicant asking Alex what kind of heroin he preferred, and also indicating that he could supply 'ice', or methylamphetamine, of good quality at the price of $120,000 per kilo. Arrangements were made for a further meeting on the following day. 
        
        
       6. On the afternoon on 13 April, Alex met the applicant and a co-offender, Nguyen, in Ultimo. They were joined by Dat, who was carrying $306,000 as show money in the boot of his vehicle. After some discussion, the applicant, Nguyen and Alex, drove to a block of home units in Illawarra Road, Marrickville. They were followed by Dat in his vehicle. Further discussions took place those premises concerning the arrangements for the exchange of the heroin and the money. 
        
        
       7. At this point, Alex and Dat changed their roles, Alex remaining in Dat's vehicle with the money, while Dat went with the applicant and Nguyen to a unit inside the Illawarra Road building. Dat was 
         
       there introduced to another person, Le, with whom further discussion took place in relation to the way in which the exchange would be effected. 
        
        
       8. Le indicated that the transaction would take place at another location. She then walked with Dat to Ewart Street in Dulwich Hill, where they were both picked up by an Asian male, driving a motor vehicle registered to Le. 
        
        
       9. The driver of this vehicle then took them a short distance down Ewart Street, before stopping at another block of home units. Le drove off, leaving Dat and the Asian driver behind. On their way into the building, they were met by an unidentified Asian male and an Asian female in the courtyard. The former handed a shopping bag to the driver, and then left with the female. Dat and the driver went into unit 13, where Dat was given the shopping bag which, upon inspection, was found to contain three packages, each containing two blocks of heroin. 
        
        
       10. Dat contacted Alex by mobile phone to confirm that he had received the heroin and, also, to make arrangements to bring the money to the unit. In the meantime, Alex, the applicant and Nguyen had remained together at Marrickville, in or near the vehicle which contained the money. 
        
        
       11. During this period, Nguyen had engaged in a number of conversations by mobile phone with Le, whom he referred to as 'Aung Phuong' and with the driver of the motor vehicle. 
        
        
       12. After the call from Dat was received, the money was counted and Nguyen confirmed with the driver of Le's vehicle, whom he addressed as 'Uncle', that the money was correct. 
        
        
       13. Nguyen then directed Alex to drive to Ewart Street. When they arrived there, Nguyen left the vehicle and went into the unit where Dat was waiting. The applicant and Alex waited outside for them. They were, at this point, arrested and the bag containing the $306,000 was recovered. When Nguyen and Dat left the unit carrying the shopping bag, with its heroin packages, they were also arrested, as was Le, a short time later.” 
        
       
     6 It should be noted that Pham had also entered a plea of guilty to the supply of the small sample of drugs. 
     7 The sentencing judge in this case found that the participation of the applicant was only on 13 April 2000. It is clear the undercover operative, Dat, went to her unit in Illawarra Road, Marrickville, and then they walked together to Dulwich Hill, where they were picked up by another person driving the applicant's car. The man driving the car and Dat got out of the vehicle in order to pick up the drugs and the applicant drove her car home. Apparently, the applicant was going to check the money, but the others had left her apartment before she returned there.8 The sentencing judge said: ""It is very difficult to determine in any precise way the respective roles of Cuong, Le, Pham and Nguyen"". She went on to say: ""What I am satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt is the prisoner occupied a significant role in a well-organised operation for the wholesale supply of drugs. Her role was active, critical and important, as disclosed in the tape recordings. The criminality she engaged in was very serious. Her participation was though, an isolated event"". In carrying out this assessment, her Honour acted completely in accordance with the principles set out in Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 1550.9 A significant thrust of this application is to challenge the sentence on the basis of an asserted disparity with the other sentences imposed, particularly the sentence imposed on Nguyen. The sentencing judge was clearly well aware of the need to avoid any justified sense of grievance which might arise as a result of her sentence and bore in mind the principles set out the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. Her Honour correctly noted that the judge who sentenced Nguyen indicated that, apart from the plea of guilty, the sentence would have been ten years and was reduced to seven and a half years because of the plea. It was also correct to point out that Nguyen was 19 at the time of the offence although, apparently, he was on bail on charges of goods in custody, possessing prohibited drugs and possessing a knife.10 Her Honour noted that Pham was 30 at the time of the offence and that the sentencing judge indicated that, but for the plea of guilty, he would have imposed a head sentence of fourteen years. Bearing in mind these distinguishing features in the cases of Pham and Nguyen, there is, in my view, no basis for this applicant to maintain she has a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing her sentence to the sentences of her co-offenders. 
     11 There was a powerful subjective case put on behalf of the applicant. She was 36 years old at the time of the offence and had no prior convictions. The psychologist's report relates a difficult background history in Vietnam, before she and her husband left to come to Australia. They spent two years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong, before arriving in Australia. Subsequently, she separated from her husband and remarried about four years ago. She has four children, born between 1985 and 1993. The psychologist's report notes she is somewhat isolated in gaol because of her limited English and the judge took that into account when passing sentence.12 There was material tendered before the Court to indicate the applicant had been studying while in prison and it was pressed that there were special circumstances to disturb the statutory ratio. The judge accepted these submissions.13 In my view, there is no substance to the challenge relating to disparity, for the reasons I have already given. It remains then to consider the sentence as a whole. The sentencing judge has made a very careful analysis of the material in this case, both as to the objective features of the offence itself and as to the subjective aspects relating to the applicant. It must be borne in mind, as was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Pham supra at 6:  
      
       
        
         
         ""However, the fact remains that trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs, in the course of an operation which is as sophisticated as that seen in this case, is an offence for which condign sentences are expected, both by way of punishment and in the interests of specific and general deterrence. See 
          Pilley 
          (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 and 
          Chan 
          [1999] NSWCCA 103"". 
         
        
       
     14 In my view, the applicant played an active and significant role in the organised sale of a significant amount of heroin. The sentence imposed was an appropriate sentence for the applicant's participation in this crime. I would grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal.15 ADAMS J: I agree with his Honour and wish to add an observation of my own.16 Leaving aside the social and personal problems caused by addiction to heroin and other such drugs, no society can long survive if persons are permitted to make a profit - and a substantial profit - out of breaking the laws; that is one of the reasons why this offence must be treated with great seriousness. Because of the circumstances in which such offences come to be committed, they bring in their train significant social problems involving serious corruption and substantial violence. On a personal level, innocent members of the public suffer burglaries and robberies, as addicts seek the means with which to satisfy their addiction in the black market created by prohibition.17 These considerations not only justify, but require substantial sentences to be passed on persons who deliberately seek to make a profit from it.18 The orders of the Court will be as proposed by his Honour Justice Blanch.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Minh Hau Nguyen has pleaded guilty before me to the manslaughter of Sok Cheat Hem on 10 February 2001 at Erskine Park. He has also pleaded guilty to the malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm of Tautai Fuimaono at that place and at that time, and two charges of maliciously discharging a pistol with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Lue Lanosga and Danilo Lareza respectively. In addition, he has sought that I take into account on sentencing for the crime of manslaughter, an offence of possess unregistered firearm, the firearm in question being the pistol with which he shot Sok Cheat Hem and Tautai Fuimaono and which he discharged with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Mr. Lanosga and Mr. Lareza. 
     
      
    2 That last offence, I am informed, is punishable by a maximum, in these circumstances, of two years imprisonment. The crime of manslaughter is punishable by a maximum of 25 years imprisonment. The crime of maliciously wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is punishable by a maximum of 25 years imprisonment. That crime may be committed in a number of ways: by maliciously wounding with intent, or maliciously shooting at with intent. The remaining offences are crimes under s.33A of the Crimes Act 1900, and are punishable by a maximum, in each case, of 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 Upon arraignment before me, the offender indicated his willingness to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Mr. Hem while pleading not guilty to the original charge of murder. That plea was accepted by the Crown Prosecutor in full discharge of the offender’s liability on that count in the indictment. Further, he indicated today that he wished me to take into account the matter to which I have referred on the Form 1 and I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me to take that matter into account and I do so. 
     
      
    4 The matter has proceeded before me upon the basis of the Crown tendering a short recital of the facts and in addition an extensive volume of materials to corroborate the account contained in that document. That recital of facts may be summarised as follows. On the evening of Saturday 10 February 2001, the accused was at the home of friends in St. Clair. His host left the premises, leaving the accused and other persons playing computer games in a rear room. The deceased and the victims of the other three charges, with other friends that afternoon, conspired to rob those premises. They had apparently formed the view that money or drugs might have been able to be obtained. Mr. Fuimaono was apparently a leading proponent of the proposal to rob. It is common ground he is a large man. After the conspiracy had been formed those victims and others making up a force of about eight persons, arrived by car in the vicinity of the premises. They were armed with clubs made from a supermarket trolley handle, a steering Club lock and an iron bar. The deceased and Fuimaono went to the back of the premises to attract the attention of those inside. A request was made for the householder. The purpose of this attendance on the house was apparently to estimate the number of people who were inside the house and might resist the robbery. There were nominated drivers determined on for the evening’s enterprise. They waited with the vehicles while some six of the robbers attended on the premises. Fuimaono knocked on the door and the robbers burst into the room. At that point the offender jumped to his feet. Although the statement of facts records that there apparently was some very brief conversation (the precise nature of this is unknown) following which the accused discharged two shots from a hand gun, I was informed from the bar table by the offender's counsel that the offender produced the hand gun before the very brief conversation. It is common ground that there is no evidence to establish the nature of the very brief conversation, or who spoke and what they might have said. However, it is very clear that shortly after realising that the robbers had burst in and were armed, the accused discharged two shots from a hand gun he had with him, that hand gun being a nine millimetre self loading Chinese pistol which had a 15 shot magazine and which is the pistol referred to in the offence to be taken into account. 
     
      
    5 The first shots apparently struck Sok Hem, killing him almost instantly from a wound to his aorta. The second shot, or thereabouts, struck Fuimaono in the lower abdomen loin area. At this point those other robbers in the premises decamped towards the cars. The accused pursued them firing shots. At some point in this latter part of the exercise two of the persons who entered the vehicles fleeing, were struck, one in the wrist and another on the back of the hand. I am informed by the Crown Prosecutor that only minor wounds were thereby occasioned. The cars sped off. 
     
      
    6 The accused returned to the premises, threw the gun onto the roof of the house and spoke to his friends telling them to blame the use of the gun on the robbers on the basis that the robbers had brought the gun to the premises. This project was unsuccessful. It came to light that it was the accused who was armed with the hand gun and had fired it. 
     
      
    7 The gun was later located on the roof of the premises and seven live rounds were found to be contained in the magazine. Five cartridge cases and one live round were found on the roadway adjacent to where the cars were parked. The serial number of the hand gun had been obliterated.  
     
      
    8 The evidence of the project to rob the premises was corroborated by the admissions of the surviving victims, and certain of the persons who came to the premises, in particular Tautai Fuimaono, Lue Lanosga, Francis Lanosga, Danilo Lareza and Theodoric Templonuevo, have been dealt with for their part in that venture. Keith Delrio and Thomas Ho are apparently still to be dealt with. 
     
      
    9 In the statement of facts provided to me by the Crown, there is extracted a portion of the interview with Mr. Lanosga. He refers to the plan as being for five of them to go into the house and steal the drugs and money; that one of the robbers was “gunna smack” the first guy he saw inside the room. It was apparently accepted that so acting would hurt that person severely. 
     
      
    10 At the scene, the offender gave an account to the police which accorded, except in one respect, with the evidence that has subsequently come to light. He referred to two persons coming in, one of the persons in the room being pushed aside and one of the intruders having a metal bar. He refers to hearing the gun go off after a fight and attributing the gun to one of the intruders in particular Mr. Hem. That statement was of course a lie. Mr. Hem died from the single gunshot wound inflicting the damage to the aorta to which I have referred. Patently the shot that was fired at him was fired at his body. Mr. Tautai Fuimaono sustained a single gunshot wound also to his body in the area to which I have referred. The damage occasioned by that wound required a laparotomy to be performed. There was a multiple perforation of the small intestine and mid transverse colon. He underwent surgery which repaired the damage. 
     
      
    11 The offender has a prior record. That record includes matters in 1994 in the Children’s Court for goods in custody and shoplifting in respect of which he received a recognisance. In addition, he was convicted on a charge of armed robbery with wounding pursuant to s.98 of the Crimes Act 1900 on 12 May 1997, and sentenced that day by Judge Graham in the District Court. He had pleaded guilty to the charge and his Honour had taken into account when sentencing on that charge, matters on a Form 1 of making a false instrument, possessing false implements, custody of an offensive weapon and stealing a motor vehicle. A further crime of assault with intent to rob being armed was included on a committal for sentence document. Those matters resulted in sentences in the ultimate imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal following a Crown appeal whereby in relation to the matter on indictment and the matters on the Form 1 the offender was sentenced to three years and six months penal servitude by way of minimum term with an additional term of three years and six months. For the matter on the committal for sentence document, a fixed term of three years and six months penal servitude was imposed. It was concurrent with the sentence imposed on the matter on the indictment. 
     
      
    12 The facts of those offences are chilling. The matter involved in the committal for sentence document involved the offender seizing a victim from behind near a hotel at night holding a machete to his neck while uttering the words, “Do you want to die or else give me your wallet”. There was a struggle. The victim suffered minor cuts but his cries for help resulted in the offender being arrested. He gave as his reason for the commission of this offence the need to raise money to pay a fine arising out of a public transport infringement notice. The matters on the Form 1 were apparently committed whilst the respondent was on bail for that offence. 
     
      
    13 In company with four other young males, the offender sought to rob the Chinese Acupuncture Centre in Burwood. The manager had a substance sprayed in his face. The offender, with four others, entered the premises and assaulted the unfortunate victim with knives. He sustained injuries and cuts to his legs, arms, back, stomach and head. He anticipated he would be beheaded. His hands and ankles were tied together and his left hand was pulled from under his body, money was taken from him. He was gagged apparently with a towel. He was threatened with injury to himself and his daughters if he reported the matter to the police. The injury threatened to him was that he would be put to death. He has been affected in his ability to continue his profession, which required a physical ability, which has been affected as a consequence of his injuries. The female receptionist at the premises was also sprayed, tied up and threatened with a knife. 
     
      
    14 When the offender was arrested he was found in possession of a knife. In addition he had been sentenced on 3 December 1996, to a fixed term of three months on a charge of steal a motor vehicle and fined for being an unlicensed driver. It appears also that on 25 November 1997, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months for possession of a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    15 That record is one of some considerable criminality. I particularly have regard to it in the light of the material provided to me in Exhibit 1 setting out the offender’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    16 He was born in Vietnam on 15 November 1977. His parents fled from that country when he was three years old, spending three months in a camp in Thailand and then coming to Australia. The unchallenged subjective material is that he received a strictly disciplined childhood and was required to take responsibility for the other children. He apparently did well at school, including doing well at a selective high school until at about the age of 15 he began to rebel and drifted into contact with gangs engaged in criminal activity. His behaviour deteriorated. He became, in his own words, arrogant and in due course was suspended from school. He continued his association with criminal gangs and ended up in gaol. These are the matters to which he has adverted in his own statement to the court concerning his objective circumstances. He also refers to some change when he first left gaol in that he determined to become a mature aged student and was accepted to the University of New South Wales but had to withdraw because of financial problems. He tried to make his way in the commercial world setting up a logistics company, but that fell apart when the events giving rise to the offences occurred and his circumstances now are such that he is no longer at the university. 
     
      
    17 He has referred to his family feeling deep shame associated with their son being involved in such criminal activity. He has referred to a willingness whilst in custody to apply his undoubted intelligence and skills usefully. He has expressed his contrition and said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I bore no animosity to those who invaded the homes. I was scared and frightened and believed what I did was necessary. I accept I went too far and must be punished for what has happened. I sincerely regret the death of Mr Hem.” 
        
       
      
    18 In argument, I referred to the absence of formal victims' impact statements on the sentencing proceedings. It is, however, notwithstanding their absence, necessary, according to usual common law principles, to have regard to the harm caused by the criminal conduct for which an offender is being sentenced when it comes to determining that element of a sentence which is denunciatory and punitive of the offender. But, I have regard to the principles in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76 the necessity in a case of homicide not to consider the particular life taken as of greater value than any other. 
     
      
    19 Submissions have been made to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor concerning the appropriate range of sentence. In particular, he draws my attention to the mass of authority in this and other courts that the crime of manslaughter can take so many forms and embrace such a wide range of culpability that it is normally of the greatest difficulty to fix an appropriate tariff within which to place a sentence. The plea however here is accepted on the basis of the excessive use of force in defence of self and others against threatened serious crimes. That means that although serious, the offence is not of the gravest. 
     
      
    20 It is accepted that I should have regard to the fact that the offender was on parole for the offences in respect of which sentence was imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal at the time of the commission of these offences. That matter aggravates the culpability of the crime of possession of the unlicensed firearm greatly, but I have regard to the fact that the Parole Board must take its own action in respect of any breach of parole. As far as the sentence for the crime of manslaughter and for the other crimes embraced in the indictment is concerned however, it would be wrong since they were not crimes of any planning or premeditation involving any deliberate infringement of parole to have too much regard for the fact that in the unforseen and unique circumstances of this case, the offender’s response to the actions of the robbers was a response which occurred whilst he was on parole. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing exercise here is of some difficulty as I accept the submissions put by both counsel that this matter is unique. I accept however that there is a serious degree of culpability in the offender failing to restrain himself once the immediate threat had passed and pursuing the surviving intruders, firing shots at them as they fled. On the other hand I accept that it would be unnatural to assume that the blood must cool instantly. I consider there remained some considerable element of provocation still affecting the mind of the offender at the time he fired even the last of those shots. 
     
      
    22 I accept also the submission of the Crown that to carry a gun will inevitably attract a risk that it will be used and the potential for deadly consequences is obvious. So that I regard the culpability of the manslaughter and the wounding charges as to some extent aggravated by resort to the use of the gun, although I accept that the exigencies of the moment were such that the offender simply resorted to what protective weapon was at hand. 
     
      
    23 In the submissions for Mr. Nguyen, it is pointed out that this matter falls into a legislative regime that was entirely unique in that not only did the recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1900 codifying the law of self-defence as now provided for s.418 to s.421 of that Act apply, but also the provisions of the Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998 applied, those provisions have recently been repealed. 
     
      
    24 The plea by the offender of guilty to manslaughter was a plea that it is conceded was of high utilitarian value, showed contrition and should attract a substantial measure of discount having regard to s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, particularly in the context that in this legislative regime it might have been open to the offender to hold a view that he had a substantial chance of acquittal having regard to the provisions of the Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998 if they were, as submitted, applicable. 
     
      
    25 The Crown concedes, as has been submitted on the offender's behalf, that he should have the value of contrition, an assessment of the utilitarian value of his pleas as very high, particularly in the context where the Crown might have had to rely on the evidence of the robbers, and that there has been shown a willingness to facilitate the processes of justice including a willingness to identify the intruders to the authorities, albeit that it was not necessary, having regard to their pleas, pleas they could hardly avoid making because of the wounds they sustained, to make use of that willingness on his part. 
     
      
    26 I am of the view that in those circumstances he should receive the benefit of a 25% discount on each of the sentences. 
     
      
    27 It is necessary for me also to have regard to the submission that he was not the aggressor, nor did he in any way precipitate the actions of the victim, he was a mere guest in the house into which the attackers came and the impulse which actuated him in the commission of these crimes was protective and responsive to the aggression and violent attack upon he and those there present. His response was however in its extent and nature unreasonable. 
     
      
    28 I have regard to the matters referred to in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Each offence charged in the indictment formed part of a course of conduct. I have regard to the personal circumstances of the victims and in particular the course that they were taking that night. I have regard to the need to deter the offender or others from committing an offence of the same or similar character. In that regard particularly I am of the view that the offence taken into account should be treated more severely than it would otherwise be even though it is being dealt with procedurally in the way in which it is. I have regard too, to the matters referred to in s.21A(2)(g), (h), (i) and (j): 
     
      
       
        
        ""(g) the need to protect the community from the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (h) the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
        
       
       
        
        (i) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (j) the prospect of rehabilitation of the offender."" 
        
       
      
    29 In particular, I am of the view that there does appear to be prospects of rehabilitation of the offender evidenced by his plea and by the way in which he comes forward to have these matters dealt with. I accept that the offences occurred as a spur of the moment over-reaction. I accept that given what has occurred, I should not attach too much significance to the offender’s initial attempt while on parole to conceal his role in the offences and to perform acts which otherwise might have amounted to a severe perversion of the course of justice.  
     
      
    30 I accept he is a young man of intelligence and considerable prospects. If he would, in the time in which he will be in custody, make use of those prospects he may ensure that he receives the benefit of a parole period which may work to his advantage and to the community’s advantage should he seek to lead an honest and estimable life. 
     
      
    31 The submissions of both counsel require me to have regard to the decision of the High Court in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 but it is conceded as I understand it by both submissions that having regard to this spate of criminality occurring as it did in one incident of very short compass, it is appropriate that the sentences I impose, although individually appropriate for each separate offence, should be made entirely concurrent. It was submitted by both counsel that the appropriate course was that the sentence should commence on 16 May 2001, that being the date the offender was taken into custody for these matters. 
     
      
    32 The Crown submits I should not find special circumstances. It is submitted on the offender’s behalf that there are special circumstances. I agree. They include the need for extensive and lengthy supervision on parole, the age of the offender, the circumstance that the offences charged in the indictment came about in a manner that was unforseen and in respect of which his response was one that was criminal because it exceeded what was reasonable in the circumstances, not because it would otherwise have been illegal. That matter does not suggest to me that he should be deprived of the expectations that a longer than usual parole period might encourage towards a lawful and rewarding life, that his intelligence and ability might allow him to achieve. Further the sentence will be partly cumulative upon his earlier lengthy sentence and I must have regard to the principle of totality, not only when imposing the head sentence but also in determining whether special circumstances exist and if they do what non parole period should be imposed.  
     
      
    33 As to range, after reference to numerous cases, Mr. Haesler submitted a total sentence in the range of four and a half to five and a half years with a non parole period of 50% of the term would be appropriate having regard to the unusual and special facts situation, the basis of the plea, that the offender was himself the victim of the precipitating attack, that he acted in a critical situation, as is apparently accepted by the basis on which the Crown accepted the plea, with a genuine belief that what he was doing was reasonable in the circumstances, even though that belief was not objectively reasonable, and that he was subjected to attack by persons who outnumbered those present in the house who were armed and who were apparently bigger than he was and reacted on the spur of the moment. I have regard to all of those matters, they are all of substance but I do not accept that the sentence should be as short as that suggested by Mr. Haesler. Notwithstanding all of those matters this was still a spate of crimes of considerable gravity and the offence taken into account on Form 1 is such as to deserve considerably more than merely a minimal component of the sentence to be imposed on the first count.  
     
      
    34 In my view the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the first count, taking that matter into account, is a sentence of seven years imprisonment to commence on 16 May 2001 and to expire on 15 May 2008. On that sentence there should be a non- parole period of three and a half years to commence on 16 May 2001 and expire on 15 November 2004. That would permit Mr. Nguyen to be released on or after 16 November 2004. On the charge of maliciously wounding Tautai Fuimaono, I am of the view that there should be a fixed term of imprisonment to date from 16 May 2001, of three years. On count three, I am of the view that there should be a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, and on count four, a fixed term of imprisonment of two years. In each of those cases that fixed term will commence on 16 May 2001, and be served wholly concurrently with the non-parole period imposed on count one.  
     
      
    35 Mr. Nguyen, would you stand please. On count one, you are sentenced to seven years imprisonment to commence on 16 May 2001. On that count I impose a non-parole period of three years six months to expire on 15 November 2004. On count two, you are sentenced to imprisonment for three years to commence on 16 May 2001. That is by way of a fixed term. On counts three and four, you are sentenced to fixed terms of two years on each count, each to commence on 16 May 2001. You therefore become liable to be released from custody at the earliest on 16 November 2004. Is there any other formality under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or otherwise that I am required to observe gentlemen?

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal against sentence. The Respondent pleaded guilty to a range of offences which he committed over the course of 1 and 2 March 2001, together with a co-offender, commencing with escape from lawful custody and then a number of property and sexual assault offences. 
      
       
     2 The Respondent and his co-offender, Sydney Justin Bowtell, were inmates at the Grafton Correctional Centre. Both were serving lengthy sentences for crimes of violence. Some time on the evening of 28 February 2001 or the morning of 1 March 2001, the two prisoners escaped from the minimum security section unit and scaled the external wall of the Correctional Centre utilizing a homemade grappling hook. 
      
       
     3 By the evening of 2 March they had made their way to Sawtell Beach where the victim, a fifty year old woman, had the misfortune to be out for a walk. As she proceeded along a track near the beach, she was attacked by the two escapees. She was assaulted and, although screaming and fighting with her attackers, she was subdued, tape was used to cover her mouth and her hands were tied with a cord and a piece of rope. She was taken to her own motor vehicle and placed in the rear seat. The offenders drove off in the vehicle with her. The victim claims that during this period she was scared and believed she was going to be killed or tortured. 
      
       
     4 The car was driven to an area of bushland believed to be in the Bruxton State Park Forest. The victim was taken out of the car and placed on the boot lid. She was stripped naked by the two offenders. They took turns having penile/vaginal intercourse with her. The victim believes that each of the offenders had intercourse with her on about four or five occasions. She was also forced on one occasion to have oral intercourse with the Respondent. 
      
       
     5 During this period the victim remembers being threatened with a pair of scissors and the statement being made to her that the offenders would ""fill you full of holes"". There was also a reference to ""we could slit your throat"". The sexual assault on the boot lid of the car was the subject of one of two charges of aggravated sexual assault. 
      
       
     6 The two offenders then forced the victim into the car. The co-offender drove the vehicle at high speed along the bushland track. During this period the Respondent had further sexual intercourse in the rear seat of the vehicle with the victim. This was the subject of the second charge of aggravated sexual assault. 
      
       
     7 The victim's ordeal had not then ceased. She was driven to another unknown location where the Respondent again had penile/vaginal intercourse with her in the car. She was taken out of the car and the co-offender then had sexual intercourse with her again, whilst the Respondent kept a lookout. 
      
       
     8 During the course of the escapade the offenders had taken $20 from her wallet at one point to buy petrol. Subsequently she was taken to an automatic teller machine and forced to withdraw $50 with which the offenders purchased some cigarettes and drink. These two incidents were the subject of two charges of aggravated robbery. 
      
       
     9 Eventually the victim was released and the two offenders drove off in her car. She had been kidnapped and detained by he offenders from sometime in the evening of 2 March until about 11.00pm that night. 
      
       
     10 At about 11.30pm the vehicle was involved in a fail to stop accident with a State Emergency vehicle. The accident was witnessed by a police officer who attempted to stop the vehicle unsuccessfully. Grafton Highway Patrol intercepted the vehicle and a pursuit ensued. The cars travelled at high speed into the town of Grafton. The car was driven by the co-offender at speed and in a manner dangerous to the public and the police officers involved. The pursuit concluded when both offenders left the vehicle in a paddock area known as Bushgrove, situated on the Pacific Highway approximately 15 kilometers north of Grafton. An extensive search by police utilising specialist officers and air support, was undertaken, resulting in the arrest of the Respondent in a nearby paddock, some six hours after he had left the vehicle. 
      
       
     11 The Respondent had been incarcerated at Grafton Correctional Centre on two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. He had been sentenced to ten years imprisonment on each count, commencing on 19 April 1994 with a minimum term of seven years and six months. The minimum term would expire on 17 October 2001 and the final release date would have been 18 April 2004. As will presently appear his Honour commenced a number of the sentences on 18 October 2001. Although, in the circumstances, it is inconceivable that the Respondent could have been released to parole on the expiration of his minimum term, it was nevertheless appropriate for his Honour to ensure that this was so. 
      
       
     12 On the count of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s154AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, with its maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, his Honour imposed a fixed term of three years commencing on 18 October 2001 and expiring on 17 October 2004. On the one charge of kidnapping, contrary to s90A of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment, his Honour imposed a fixed term of five years commencing on 18 October 2001 and expiring on 17 October 2006. 
      
       
     13 With respect to the two offences of aggravated robbery under s95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which has a maximum penalty of twenty years, his Honour noted that the circumstances of aggravation were the infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim and the deprivation of liberty. His Honour imposed a fixed term of four years commencing on 18 October 2001 and expiring on 17 October 2005. 
      
       
     14 The above sentences were concurrent with each other and commenced at the expiration of the minimum term of the Respondent's existing sentences. In the circumstances, it is, in my opinion, inconceivable that the Respondent would be released to parole on 18 October 2001. He would have served his full sentence until 18 April 2004. Accordingly, the consequence of partial accumulation in the manner his Honour adopted was, in substance, to reduce by two and a half years the effective sentence for each of these offences. 
      
       
     15 His Honour then dealt with the two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse. In the case of the single act of intercourse in the motor vehicle whilst the car was being driven along a bush track at high speed, he sentenced the Respondent to a fixed term of six years commencing on 18 October 2002 (i.e. a year after the commencement of the other sentences, but still eighteen months before the expiration of the full term for the sentences being served at the time of the escape). This sentence will expire on 17 October 2008. 
      
       
     16 For the other charge of aggravated sexual intercourse, namely, the repeated rapes on the boot of the car, the Respondent was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment, commencing on 18 October 2002 and expiring on 17 October 2013, with a non-parole period of six years, commencing on 18 October 2002 and expiring on 17 October 2008. Again, it is relevant to note that, on the assumption that I believe is entirely appropriate that the Respondent would not be released to parole for the charges on which he was serving a sentence at the time of the escape, the effective non-parole period for this offence is four and a half years 
      
       
     17 His Honour then came to sentence for the offence of escape from lawful custody. He referred to s57 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which requires the Court to impose such a sentence consecutively upon any other sentence of imprisonment, which the Respondent was serving at the time of the escape from lawful custody or which was imposed in the same proceedings. (In either case, the consecutive sentence is to commence on the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence, or the term of the sentence, in a case where there is no non-parole period.) His Honour chose the latter of the two alternatives, that is, making the sentence for the escape, consecutive upon the other sentences upon which he was sentencing the Respondent at the time. 
      
       
     18 His Honour fixed a term of two years imprisonment consecutive on the non-parole period for the aggravated sexual intercourse offence and also, it appears, at the expiration of the fixed term of six years for the other aggravated sexual intercourse offence. Accordingly, the sentence for the escape from lawful custody offence will commence on 18 October 2008 and expire on 17 October 2010. 
      
       
     19 The effect of sentencing in this way was to have the sentence for escape from lawful custody expire on 17 October 2010, three years before the expiration of the head sentence for the longer of the two sentences for aggravated sexual intercourse. Although there was nothing in the history of the Respondent to suggest any serious prospect of being released to parole, it was appropriate to act on the assumption that there was some hope in this regard. Plainly, the future conduct of the Respondent would determine this matter. 
      
       
     20 His Honour accurately described the conduct of the Respondent and his co-offender as: ""despicable, atrocious, dehumanising acts against the one female, who appeared absolutely helpless throughout the ordeal."" The terror induced in the victim and the physical abuse to which she was subjected over a sustained period of time, indicated that the offences of aggravated sexual assault were of the highest gravity. 
      
       
     21 His Honour rejected the Crown submission that these offences were in the ""worst category"" of such offences. However, he did find that the aggravated sexual assault offences fell ""just short of that category”. No doubt, in this regard, his Honour had in mind the degree of physical injury involved to the victim. That was substantial, involving abrasions and bruising to various parts of the victim's body, including the neck, shoulder, arms, lower back, right leg, left thigh, left ear, lips, throat, right wrist, left upper leg and both lower legs. She also had a dislocated left knee and a labial split on the introitus and mons. These injuries were a manifestation of the physical violence to which she had been subjected. 
      
       
     22 The injuries were substantial, but the worst class of case of an attack of this character could involve injuries of a more substantial kind than bruising and abrasions and also, a higher level of threat, over a sustained period, instilling fear for the victim's life. I agree with his Honour that the offences in the present case fell ""just short"" of the worst class of case. The issue is whether or not that was reflected in the sentence his Honour imposed. 
      
       
     23 His Honour summarised what was put before him in terms of the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, particularly in the form of a psychological report. This included his family history, particularly the point in time in his youth after the death of a sister when his father's behaviour changed to the extent that he was subject to significant beatings. He grew to hate his father. 
      
       
     24 He left school at the beginning of Year 8 and, initially, found a job. He commenced his long involvement with the criminal justice system at the age of nineteen with offences of break, enter and steal to obtain money for drugs. He subsequently had two relationships which produced three children. The psychologist's assessment noted that his ""presentation and personality profile and his record of offences implies that he is dangerous and he is strangely aware of that himself"". 
      
       
     25 There is nothing in the subjective circumstances of the Respondent to justify any substantial mitigation on the sentence that would be imposed on the basis of the objective gravity of the offences. The only element of hardship is his self-reported victimisation by his father as a youth. No doubt, that may have served, historically, as part of the explanation for his subsequent career of anti-social behaviour. It is not of a character that is entitled to significant weight by way of mitigation in the circumstances of the case. Whether or not it constitutes some form of explanation, as the psychologist suggested, it has long since lost significant mitigating effect. 
      
       
     26 The Respondent's criminal record commenced in 1982 with convictions for assault and possession of drugs, which were dealt with in the Local Court. In 1983, he was convicted of offences of goods in custody and three break, enter and steal matters, again dealt with in the Local Court. 
      
       
     27 In 1984, there were convictions for break, enter and steal, driving without a licence, failure to appear and a breach of recognisance. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. 
      
       
     28 In 1985, he was sentenced for further drug offences and a further false pretences offence In 1987, he was convicted of assaulting a female and released on a bond. However, later in that year, he was convicted in the District Court of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug and cultivating prohibited plants. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. 
      
       
     29 In 1987, he was convicted of a number of offences of stealing, break, enter and steal, failing to appear and possessing a prohibited drug and was sentenced to a number of terms of imprisonment, that were served concurrently with the longer term of imprisonment imposed by the District Court. 
      
       
     30 After his release in 1990, he was convicted of offences of unlawful entry, failure to appear, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four counts of break, enter and steal, and seven counts of false pretences. He received various prison sentences. 
      
       
     31 In 1992, he was convicted of the offence of escaping lawful custody and sentenced to a short period of imprisonment. In 1994, he was convicted of two offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and, on each count, was sentenced to a minimum term of seven years and six months and an additional term of two years and six months. This was the sentence he was serving at the time of his escape. He described the offences as ""nearly killing two people"". 
      
       
     32 This disgraceful record of anti-social behaviour, demonstrating escalating violence, is such as to indicate that considerations of personal deterrence were entitled to substantial weight in the sentencing exercise. There is also the element of protection of the community, which was entitled to weight, particularly in the light of the psychologist's report, indicating that this particular offender remained a danger to the community. 
      
       
     33 As can be seen from his Honour's imposition of a term of eleven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years, his Honour varied the statutory proportion for the non-parole period under s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, on the basis that there were ""special circumstances"" which justified a non-parole period less than three-quarters of the head sentence. 
      
       
     34 His Honour identified the following matters as constituting “special circumstances"": 
      
       
        
         
         “A The prisoner's abusive childhood, upbringing. 
          
          
         B The prisoner's incarceration in the high risk unit, (HRMY) at Goulburn Correctional Centre. 
          
          
         C The prisoner's need for current and ongoing psychological and psychiatric assessment, counselling, treatment and monitoring. 
          
          
         D The prisoner's need for supervision and guidance for the duration of his parole period on release from custody.” 
          
         
        
       
     35 It is not clear to me on what basis his Honour found each of these matters to be special circumstances justifying a shorter non-parole period. This is particularly so as the effect of his Honour's imposition of the sentence of two years imprisonment for escaping from lawful custody to be served on the expiry of the non-parole period for the sexual assault offence, was such as to reduce by two years the maximum period of five years of potential release to parole under the major sentence his Honour imposed. 
      
       
     36 However, no separate challenge is made to his Honour's finding of special circumstances. The Respondent will need substantial assistance to integrate into the community upon his eventual release. That would justify a finding of special circumstances. Three years of supervision on parole is appropriate. 
      
       
     37 His Honour referred to the plea of guilty and particularly to the fact that it came at the earliest opportunity. His Honour gave particular weight to the utilitarian value of the plea and the fact that he allowed a discount of twenty-five percent on the sentence that he would otherwise have imposed by reason of this consideration. 
      
       
     38 His Honour accepted the psychologist's report which recorded a level of contrition on the part of the Respondent for the sexual assaults that he had committed. The Respondent described them as ""a putrid crime"".  
      
       
     39 It is worth noting some of the results of the psychological testing in the report before his Honour where, inter alia, the psychologist concluded: 
      
       
     · ""This combination of attributes describes an individual who would have little genuine interest in others and very little depth of feeling. Emotional closeness, warmth and intimacy would be uncomfortable and solitary pursuits more attractive.” 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · ""The combination of Anti social and Aggressive personality attributes indicates a capacity to behave in a cruel, malicious and callous fashion. The expression of anti social feelings will be overt, direct and abusive. Humiliating others is a mechanism for relieving his own psychological pain. Relatively unaffected by punishment, he would be capable of reckless and anti social acting out.” 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · ""Schizotypal and Schizoid elevations together indicate an apathetic, detached individual who will be deficient in his capacity to experience emotion. Inherently emotionally unstable, rapid and extreme mood swings from euphoria to intense irritability, anger and destructiveness would be consistent.”40 The psychologist concluded that the childhood abuse probably played a significant role in the development of his personality. The effects had been reinforced by the long periods of incarceration. He estimated that over a period of sixteen years, the Respondent has only been out of gaol for a total of twenty-one months. The psychologist concluded that he has been left ""thoroughly institutionalised"" and this has affected him ""to the point where he feels more comfortable in custody than in the community"". 
      
       
     41 The Crown submitted that his Honour erred in two respects. First, the penalties he imposed for the three sets of offences which carried a period of twenty years imprisonment, namely, detaining for advantage, aggravated robbery and aggravated sexual assault, were manifestly inadequate. Secondly, that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of totality by the manner in which he accumulated the sentences, i.e. delaying the two charges of aggravated sexual assault for only one year after the commencement of other sentences. I note that no particular submission was directed to an alleged inadequacy of the two year sentence for escaping from lawful custody. 
      
       
     42 The Crown referred to R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58, as indicating the seriousness with which the offence of aggravated sexual assault must be regarded. In that case, the circumstance of aggravation for purposes of s61J was the fact that the offences were committed in company. That was also the case in the present proceedings, although the particular circumstances of aggravation relied upon in the present case was the infliction of actual bodily harm on the victim. In that regard, the present case was worse than that recently considered in AEM. Furthermore, the subjective circumstances in AEM were entitled to some mitigation and the offenders had nothing like the disgraceful record of crime over a sustained period of time, which the Respondent displays in the present case. 
      
       
     43 In AEM, the trial judge had rejected a submission that the offenders were in the ""worst class"", but indicated that ""the offences were at the upper end of the scale of severity"" (at [55]). This Court concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “[75] It was submitted, however, that the objective gravity of these offences brought them very close to the worst category. Her Honour appears to have accepted that categorisation, considering the Crown’s submission to that effect was justified. Having done so and indeed, having referred to the various aggravating features upon which the Crown now relies as demonstrating error, her Honour imposed the sentences to which we have referred. None of the sentences exceeded a term of imprisonment of 6 years. The longest non parole period was four years. 
          
          
         [76] With respect to her Honour, sentences of that order wholly failed to address the objective seriousness of the offences and fell far short of what was necessary given her Honour's apparent acceptance that these cases were close to the worst class of case. It must follow, in our opinion, that her Honour failed to properly apply the principle of totality.” 
          
         
        
       
     44 A number of other observations made by the Court in AEM are also pertinent to the present case: 
      
       
     · ""...the principles of general deterrence and institutional denunciation of the crimes involved must play an important, although proportionate, role."" [92] 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · ""It must be stressed that all members of our society, including our young people, must be free to lawfully use the streets without fear of being subjected to either physical or sexual assault. The long term effects of the trauma invariably encountered by victims of either form of attack are well documented."" [94] 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · ""… non-consensual sexual intercourse is an extreme form of violence. It is a crime which must and will be denounced by the courts by the imposition of appropriate sentences."" [95] 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     45 Counsel for the Respondent submitted that his Honour's judgment indicated a careful assessment of the seriousness of the offences and of the various aggravating features. He relied on his Honour's detailed consideration of all of the relevant factors, broadly in the terms to which I have referred above. He drew particular attention to his Honour's determination that the sentences should be partially concurrent. He submitted that the Crown's reference to the psychologist's finding of dangerousness should be treated with caution, so as not to suggest that a form of preventive detention was being imposed. (See Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465, especially at 472-473.) Counsel also relied on the well-known restraints when dealing with a Crown appeal, including the approach referred to as the principle of ""double jeopardy"". 
      
       
     46 In my opinion, the conclusion to which this Court came in AEM is applicable in the present case. His Honour identified the circumstances of the two aggravated sexual assaults as falling ""just short"" of the worst case. However, the sentences he imposed do not suggest that his starting point for sentence approximated the upper range of the maximum permissible sentence. The circumstances of this case reveal virtually nothing in the way of mitigation. The long history of criminal conduct was only marginally alleviated by the history of child abuse. Other than in that respect, the subjective circumstances of the Respondent were not entitled to weight. 
      
       
     47 The one factor entitled to significant weight was the plea of guilty. In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to apply a top of the range discount of twenty-five percent. However, the head sentences his Honour imposed, on the more serious of the aggravated sexual assault offences, was eleven years. This suggested that his Honour adopted a starting point prior to the discount of the plea of something in the order of fifteen years. This does not reflect a starting point reflecting the objective gravity of the offence as ""just short"" of the worst case. On that basis, a starting point of something of the order of eighteen years would have been appropriate and a twenty-five percent discount for the plea would bring the head sentence down to about thirteen years and six months. Absent a finding of special circumstances, this would suggest a non-parole period of the order of about ten years.  
      
       
     48 Although this would have been appropriate at first instance, applying the principle of double jeopardy does not permit this Court to sentence on that basis. Assuming, for the reasons I have given above, the impracticality of any release to parole for the prior offences, the effect of his Honour's accumulation of the sentences and of the way in which his Honour imposed an additional sentence for the escape offence, was to impose upon the Respondent, over and above the sentence he was already serving, an additional head sentence of eleven years for the entire course of criminality with a minimum period of eight years. In this case, the principle of totality is of particular significance. That principle extends to encompass the period of incarceration prior to the escape. 
      
       
     49 In my opinion, given the totality of the conduct, the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Bearing in mind the principle of double jeopardy and that of totality, the additional term should be thirteen years, of which at least ten years should actually be served, with a period of three years potentially in the community under supervision on parole. The inadequacy arises from the way his Honour accumulated the sentences. In my opinion, the two sexual assaults should have been partially cumulative: they were separated in time and location, with the earlier and more serious incident being one of four or five acts in company and accompanied by threats to the victim's life. 
      
       
     50 Release to parole assumes that the Respondent's conduct over future years is such as, contrary to his past conduct, could lead to release on parole. For the reasons I have given above, it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances which permits the variation of the statutory ratio for which s44 provides. 
      
       
     51 I would not interfere with the sentences imposed by his Honour with respect to the charges of stealing a motor vehicle, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Indeed, I did not understand the Crown to submit that that should be done. However, I would quash the sentences imposed for the two aggravated sexual intercourse charges in terms and dates, with a consequential need to vary the dates for the sentence of escape from lawful custody. The orders I propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The sentences imposed by his Honour with respect to the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, kidnapping and aggravated robbery (two counts) affirmed. 
        
        
       2. Quash the other sentences imposed by the trial judge and in lieu thereof impose the following sentences. 
        
        
         
         (i) For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse in the motor vehicle whilst it was being driven along a bush track at speed, sentence the Respondent to a fixed term of six years imprisonment to commence on 18 October 2002 and expiring on 17 October 2008. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse on the boot of the car, sentence the Respondent to a head sentence of eleven years commencing on 18 October 2004 and expiring on 17 October 2015 and fix a non-parole period of six years to commence on 18 October 2004 and expiring on 17 October 2010. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) For the offence of escape from lawful custody, a fixed term of two years commencing on 18 October 2010 and expiring on 17 October 2012. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Affirm the trial judge's conditions for release to parole. 
         
        
       
     52 ADAMS J: I agree. 
      
       
     53 BLANCH J: I also agree. 
      
       
     54 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

      REGINA v Allan BAKER 
      
      
       
     FACTSThis is an appeal against the refusal by Greg James J to determine a minimum and additional term in lieu of a life sentence pursuant to s 13A(4) of the Sentencing Act 1989. On June 20 1974 the appellant Allan Baker (together with Kevin Garry Crump) was convicted of the murder of Mr Ian Lamb, conspiracy to murder Mrs Virginia Morse and two counts of malicious wounding with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. Taylor J sentenced each of the offenders to life imprisonment for the murder, life imprisonment for the conspiracy to murder and 15 years hard labour for each of the two counts of malicious wounding. When sentencing the appellant, Taylor J said, “I believe you should spend the rest of your lives in gaol and there you should die. If ever there was a case where life imprisonment should mean what it says…this is it.”The Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 No 6 commenced on 9 May 1997 initiating, inter alia, changes to s 13A. Section 13A(3) instituted a separate category for persons serving an existing life sentence. The separate category was of persons in relation to whom a “non-release recommendation” had been made. Such a person was not competent to make an application for redetermination unless “at least 20 years” of the sentence had been served. A further requirement was imposed by s 13A (3A) to the effect that “[A] person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section, unless the Supreme Court, when considering the person’s application under this section, is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination.” It was accepted by the appellant that the sentencing remarks of Taylor J amounted to a non-release recommendation within the meaning of s 13A(1) and that the appellant was required to show to the satisfaction of the Court that there were “special reasons” justifying making a determination under s 13A(4).The appellant submitted that Greg James J wrongly decided that he was ineligible to make the application and did not proceed to decide whether a determination should be made under s 13A(4). It was submitted further that if his Honour did indeed make a determination under s 13A(4), he erred in the test he applied for the existence “special reasons” under s 13A(3A). Finally the appellant argued that the amending act which introduced sub-section (3A) in s 13A of the Sentencing Act was invalid in so far as it purported to vest functions in the Supreme Court of New South Wales that were incompatible with or repugnant to the exercise of judicial power of the Commonwealth by that Court.Held: per Ipp AJA, Dunford J and Bergin J agreeing(1) It can be inferred from the reasoning of Greg James J that his Honour intended to say the applicant was not eligible for a determination of a minimum and additional term because special reasons did not exist to justify such action.(2) In the legislative context, the term “special reasons” is intended to raise the threshold of satisfaction for the Court in considering whether to make a determination of a minimum and additional term. “Special reasons” connotes reasons “out of the ordinary, unusual and not to be expected.” United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 75 ALJR (at 1673), O’Hare v DPP (2000) NSWSC 430, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534.(3) It is not desirable to define the full scope of “special reasons”. However some examples that may fall under the rubric are: Meritorious service to prison authorities, other prisoners or the broader community by the provision of information leading to the recovery of stolen goods or apprehension of other criminals. Affording to an unusual degree, psychological comfort and assistance to other prisoners. Providing assistance to an unusual degree to prison authorities generally. Any combination of reasons whether inherently “special” or not, could amount to “special reasons”.(4) As rehabilitation is considered an aim of incarceration, rehabilitation simpliciter would not ordinarily be regarded as “special”. However, a particularly marked or successful rehabilitation, when coupled with other factors may constitute “special reasons”.(5) His Honour’s interpolation of the adjective “powerful” to describe the “special reasons” needed to warrant a determination under s 13A should be read as an expression of the necessity of “special reasons” to be so persuasive as to warrant the making of a determination. His Honour was using the adjective “powerful” in a sense synonymous with “special”. Accordingly his Honour did not err in the test he applied.(6) On the construction of “special reasons” postulated, it is reasonably open for an applicant under s 13A(4) to establish the existence of “special reasons.” It follows that the legislation cannot be construed as a device by Parliament to ensure that such class of persons as the appellant would never be released from prison. Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51 distinguished.(7) By s 13A(4) read with s 13A(3A) the Court is required to undertake a traditional and familiar judicial exercise, namely, the determination of factors which condition the power of the Court to afford relief to persons falling within a defined category. It therefore cannot be said that the legislation requires the Court to be a tool of the legislature.(8) The requirement of “special reasons” does not usurp judicial power. Legislative provisions that affect or change the weight to be given to relevant factors that the Court is required to assess when making a determination, even if the common law principle of proportionality of sentencing is overridden, are not a priori invalid: R v Moffatt [1998] 2 V.R. 229. (9) The fact that the legislation in question covers a small number of persons does not make it invalid: Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 501 Nicholas v The Queen (1989) 193 CLR 173.(10) Inconsistency in the making of non-release recommendations does not negative the fact that such recommendations are an expression of a judicial view based upon the circumstances of a particular case. There is no principle of law that prevents Parliament from identifying such persons by reference to criteria that, while arbitrary, have a real connection with the gravity of their offences.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The appeal and the grounds relied on by the appellant 
        
       
     2 This is an appeal against a decision by Greg James J whereby he declined to make a determination, pursuant to s 13A(4) of the Sentencing Act 1989, of a minimum term and an additional term in respect of a life sentence imposed upon the appellant by Taylor J.  
      
       
     3 On 20 June 1974, the appellant and Kevin Garry Crump were convicted of the murder of Mr Ian James Lamb, conspiracy to murder Mrs Virginia Gai Morse, and two counts of malicious wounding with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. Taylor J sentenced each of the offenders to life imprisonment for the murder, life imprisonment for the conspiracy to murder and 15 years hard labour for each of the two counts of malicious wounding.  
      
       
     4 The sentences for the counts of malicious wounding were concurrent with the life sentences and have expired. The appellant has been in custody since 13 November 1973, when he was arrested. 
      
       
     5 The application to Greg James J for a determination under s 13A(4) related to the life sentence imposed in respect of the murder of Mr Lamb. The appellant advanced three arguments in support of his appeal. Firstly, it was said that, despite the fact that the appellant sought a determination of a minimum term and an additional term under s 13A(4), Greg James J wrongly decided that the appellant was not eligible to make the application and did not proceed to decide whether a determination should be made. Secondly, it was said that, if Greg James J did make a determination under s 13A(4), he erred by applying an inappropriate test for the existence of “special reasons” under s 13A(3A). Thirdly, it was said that the Act which introduced sub-section (3A) in s 13A of the Sentencing Act (that is, the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 No 6 “the Amending Act”) was invalid in so far as it purported to vest functions in the Supreme Court of New South Wales which were incompatible with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by that Court. 
      
       
        
       The legislative background 
        
       
     6 Taylor J sentenced the appellant prior to the commencement of s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 which, by subs (2), provides that: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life”. 
         
        
        
       Prior to the coming into force of s 19A, a sentence of life imprisonment held the prospect of release on licence pursuant to s 463 of the  
       Crimes Act 
        in its then form. In  
       Kalajzich 
        (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 (at 48) Hunt CJ at CL said that release on licence was “a prospect which almost universally became fact”. Nevertheless, such release was not inevitable. 
        
       
     7 In January 1990 the Sentencing Act 1989 was amended by the introduction of s 13A. That section allowed a prisoner serving an “existing life sentence” to apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term in substitution for the indeterminate life sentence. No distinction was then made between various categories of murder or offender. “Eligibility” to make an application depended solely upon the applicant having served at least eight years of the life sentence. 
      
       
     8 On 9 May 1997 the Amending Act came into force. This Act made significant changes to s 13A. Relevantly, it inserted in sub-s (1) the definition of “non-release recommendation”, it replaced the existing sub-ss (3) and (9)(c), it altered sub-ss (8B) and (8C), and inserted sub-ss (3A), (4A), and (10A). In consequence of that amendment, s 13A read: 
      
       
        
         
         “13A.  
         Existing life sentences 
         
        
        
         
         (1) In this section: 
         
        
        
         
           
         “existing life sentence” 
          means a sentence of imprisonment for life imposed before or after the commencement of this section, but does not include a sentence for the term of a person’s natural life under section 19A of the  
         Crimes Act 
          1900 or section 33A of the  
         Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
          1985. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “non-release recommendation” 
           , in relation to a person serving an existing life sentence, means a recommendation or observation, or an expression of opinion, by the original sentencing court that (or to the effect that) the person should never be released from imprisonment. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) A person serving an existing life sentence may apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for the sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) A person is not eligible to make such an application unless the person has served: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) at least 8 years of the sentence concerned, except where paragraph (b) applies, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) at least 20 years of the sentence concerned, if the person was the subject of a non-release recommendation. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (3A) A person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section, unless the Supreme Court, when considering the person’s application under this section, is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The Supreme Court may, on application duly made for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) set both: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence for which the sentence was originally imposed, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) an additional term during which the person may be released on parole (being either an additional term for a specified period or for the remainder of the person’s natural life) 
            
           or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (b) decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. 
         
        
        
         
         (4A) In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been convicted at any time (so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court). 
         
        
        
         
         (5) A minimum term set under this section is to commence on the date on which the original sentence commenced or, if the person was remanded in custody for the offence, the date on which the first such remand commenced. 
         
        
        
         
         (6) If the Supreme Court sets a minimum term and an additional term under this section, the sentence comprising those terms replaces the original sentence of imprisonment for life. 
         
        
        
         
         (7) …. 
         
        
        
         
         (8) If the Supreme Court declines to determine a minimum term and an additional term, the Court may (when making that decision) direct that the person who made the application: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) never re-apply to the Court under this section, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) not re-apply to the Court under this section for a specified period. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (8A) If the Court gives a direction under subsection (8) that a person may never re-apply to the Court under this section, the person is to serve the existing life sentence for the term of the person’s natural life. 
         
        
        
         
         (8B) If the Court does not give a direction under subsection (8), the person may not re-apply within the period of 3 years from the date of the Court’s decision to decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term. 
         
        
        
         
         (8C) A direction under subsection (8) that a person may never re-apply to the Court under this section or not re-apply for a period exceeding 3 years may be given only if: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the person was sentenced for the crime of murder, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) it is a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that the determination be made. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (9) The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section, is to have regard to: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the  
           Crimes Act 
            1900 and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences, and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person’s rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         and may have regard to any other relevant matter. 
         
        
        
         
         (10) …. 
         
        
        
         
         (10A) The Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under this section: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) must have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant recommendations, observations and comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence concerned, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) must give consideration to adopting or giving effect to their substance and the intention of the original sentencing court when making them, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) must, to the extent that it declines to adopt or give effect to those matters, state its reasons for doing so. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (11) The Supreme Court may make a determination for a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence even though the Court was not the sentencing court, or the Court is not constituted in the same way as it was when the applicant was sentenced. 
         
        
        
         
         (12) An appeal lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section, or

     9 The Sentencing Act 1989 has been repealed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which commenced operation on 3 April 2000. It was common ground before Greg James J, however, that the appellant’s application should be dealt with under s 13A of the repealed Act (that is, in the form set out above). 
      
       
        
       The facts relating to the offences  
        
       
     10 I shall deal firstly with the murder of Mr Lamb. 
      
       
     11 3 November 1973 Mr Lamb parked his motor vehicle in a fairly isolated locality near a rest area. He fell asleep, curled up on the front seat of the vehicle. The appellant and Crump were short of petrol and money and, finding Mr Lamb asleep, they approached the vehicle with the intention of robbing him.  
      
       
     12 In a signed record of interview the appellant described the course of events that followed: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.10 What happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well we pulled in at the rest area, behind the car, we sat there for a while thinking it over and to see if any cars were coming on the road had gone. We both got out of the car, I got the rifle, I loaded it and I walked over to the car and I pointed the rifle through the window of the driver’s side and I seen a man asleep on the front seat. Kevin looked in the back to see if he was by himself and he was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.11 What happened then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I knocked on the door with my hands and said, ‘Hey you’. The bloke sat up and I pulled the trigger and shot him. It hit him in the voice box”. 
         
        
       
     13 Thereafter the two offenders drove Mr Lamb’s body and his motor vehicle to an isolated spot some 10 or 11 miles away and there abandoned the body and the vehicle. 
      
       
     14 I turn now to the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse.  
      
       
     15 In October 1972, the appellant spent three weeks doing casual work on the property of Mr Brian Morse near Collarenebri. During this period he was brought meals by Mrs Morse and got to know the three Morse children.  
      
       
     16 On 28 October 1973 Crump joined the appellant in employment at Fairfield Station. On 2 November 1973 the employment temporarily ceased. On 3 November 1973 the appellant, accompanied by Crump, purchased a .308 rifle. On that day the appellant shot Mr Lamb with the rifle.  
      
       
     17 On 7 November 1973 the appellant and Crump began surveillance of Mr Morse’s farm. They waited until Mr Morse had left the property and then gained entry to the homestead. They overpowered Mrs Morse and bound and gagged her. They ransacked the house and removed two rifles as well as other items. They carried Mrs Morse to her husband’s car and drove with her to a vehicle they had stolen. There they bound her and while she was immobilised raped her. They then drove the car until they crossed the Queensland border where they stopped near the Patterson River. There Mrs Morse was again raped by both men.  
      
       
     18 At about this time Mrs Morse began to realise that the two men were likely to kill her. She pleaded with them and referred to her young children in piteous terms. This was to no avail. 
      
       
     19 The circumstances of Mrs Morse’s murder were described by the applicant as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “She wasn’t tied to the tree, her hands were tied in front of her with handkerchiefs, she wasn’t crying because I think she was beyond that, she’d been crying most of the time, she was gagged and blindfolded. I aimed at her with the .308 and Kevin had the .22 and it was going to be like a firing squad and Kevin pulled the trigger and she fell to the ground before I could pull the trigger of my gun. If he hadn’t of shot her, I would because we both decided to kill her because we done those terrible things to her and she would have been able to identify me because I used to work for her husband I know if she reported me we would be in a lot of trouble and she just had to be shot”. 
         
        
       
     20 Crump shot Mrs Morse in the inside of her right eye because the appellant had told him: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I shot her there it would probably kill her straight out”. 
         
        
        
       The appellant was standing next to Crump and was aiming his gun at Mrs Morse when Crump shot her. 
        
       
     21 It seems that one of the appellant’s motives for killing Mrs Morse was that he had a grievance against Mr Morse. In the proceedings before Sully J the appellant said that he was not “after” Mr Morse anymore and his feelings against Mr Morse had “stopped” when he “started getting professional help along the way”. 
      
       
     22 The appellant and Crump were not charged with the murder of Mrs Morse but for the offence of conspiracy to murder her. This was because the murder took place in Queensland, outside the jurisdiction of the New South Wales courts. 
      
       
     23 The two counts of malicious wounding with intent to prevent lawful apprehension arose when the police apprehended the appellant and Crump and the two offenders shot at the police. 
      
       
     24 In regard to the murder of Mr Lamb, the appellant was the instigator, he had the gun (which he had loaded), and he fired the fatal shot. McInerney J, when dealing with an application by Crump to determine minimum and additional terms, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the material before me I am satisfied that Baker was the ring leader in this murder. Further, I am of the opinion that Crump was closely attached to Baker and easily led by him.” 
         
        
       
     25 In subsequent proceedings before Sully J, when the appellant first applied for a determination of minimum and additional terms, the appellant accepted in cross-examination that he was the dominant figure. He was asked to explain why he had caused Mrs Morse to be shot and replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. I was standing behind Kevin Crump at the time. I had already committed a murder and told him it was going to be – I wanted him to shoot her. He was wanting to go back to the police about the first matter and I didn’t want him to. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He wanted to go in and confess did he? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Something like that, I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. About the Lamb matter? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t want him to do that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you wanted to put him on an equal basis with you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you got him to fire the shot? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you were ready to fire one too weren’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The first one with him yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And he got in first? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
        
        
        
       The sentencing remarks of Taylor J 
        
       
     26 When sentencing the appellant and Crump, Taylor J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “For sheer cruelty, for callous indifference to suffering, for a complete disregard of humanity, for the complete absence of a spark of human decency, what you have done to this woman and to her children and to her husband is without parallel in my experience, and I have sat here many times over the years. You have outraged all accepted standards of the behaviour of men. The description ‘men’ ill becomes you. You would be more aptly described as animals, and obscene animals at that. 
         
        
        
         
         You murdered Lamb for $20, the petrol in his car, his clothes and his pitifully poor possessions. You robbed his body, and he was a man you did not even know. You shot him at point blank range as he was roused from his sleep. Mercifully he was probably not aware of what had happened to him. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         I believe that you should spend the rest of your lives in gaol and there you should die. If ever there was a case where life imprisonment should mean what it says – imprisonment for the whole of your lives – this is it. 
         
        
        
         
         If in the future some application is made that you be released on the grounds of clemency or of mercy, then I would venture to suggest to those who are entrusted with the task of determining whether you are entitled to it or not that the measure of your entitlement to either should be the clemency and mercy you extended to this woman when she begged you for her life”. 
         
        
       
     27 The appellant conceded that Taylor J’s remarks on sentence amounted to a non-release recommendation within the meaning of s 13A(1) and that the appellant was required to show to the satisfaction of the Court that there were special reasons to justify making a determination under s 13A(4). 
      
       
        
        
        
        
       The earlier applications for determinations of minimum and additional terms 
        
       
     28 On 5 March 1990 Crump made an application for a determination of a minimum term and an additional term. On 10 December 1992 Loveday J refused the application. Crump’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed and special leave to appeal against that decision was refused by the High Court. 
      
       
     29 On 10 May 1993, the appellant applied to Sully J for a similar determination, but it, too, was refused. In the course of his reasons Sully J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The two crimes for which the applicant was so convicted and sentenced were as wicked as can be imagined. 
         
        
        
         
         The first crime involved the cold-blooded and point blank shooting of Mr Lamb. …. The body of the murdered man was left, quite literally, to rot. 
         
        
        
         
         (W)hat was done to Mrs Morse is as terrible a tale of deliberate inhumanity as can be imagined, even in a society as plagued by violence and depravity as our own. 
         
        
        
         
         There is, so far as I can see, no credible causal link between anything in the applicant’s background and what he did to his two victims. This element of wantonness puts the applicant’s conduct at the outer and upper limit of criminal culpability. 
         
        
        
         
         …(T)he crimes here in question are so extreme that it can be accepted more readily than might be possible in a different type of case, that the ‘general moral sense of the community’ would accord precisely with the perception of Taylor J, that the applicant’s case is one, if ever there was a case, where life imprisonment should mean exactly what it says. I do not think that it could be reasonably said by any Court that was trying to maintain public respect for and public confidence in the administration of criminal justice, that such an approach was disproportionate to the degree of criminality involved.” 
         
        
       
     30 On 23 May 1994 this Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal against Sully J’s refusal. Gleeson CJ (the other judges of the Court being Smart and Studdert JJ) said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having considered the matters referred to in s 13A(9), including what is generally described by the legislation as any other relevant material, and having paid particular attention to evidence as to the appellant’s prison history, and possible prospects of rehabilitation, Sully J reached his conclusion, adverse to the applicant, essentially upon the ground of the objective gravity of the crimes committed by the appellant. They were so heinous in their nature that, in his Honour’s view, this is a case where life imprisonment should mean exactly what it says. The same view had previously been expressed by other judges who have dealt with the case. The implications of such a conclusion are such that it deserves the most careful consideration by this Court. Having given it such consideration, however, I am unable to conclude that his Honour was in error”. 
         
        
       
     31 On 24 April 1997 McInerney J granted a second application by Crump for a determination of minimum and additional terms. Significantly, this decision was made before s 13A was amended by the Amending Act. His Honour imposed a minimum term of 30 years imprisonment on Crump for the murder of Mr Lamb. The additional term imposed was the remainder of Crump’s natural life. For conspiring to murder Mrs Morse, his Honour specified a fixed term of 25 years. The latter expired on 12 November 1998. Crump is eligible for release on parole on 13 November 2003. 
      
       
        
       The ground of appeal that Greg James J decided merely that the appellant was not eligible to make the application and did not decline to make a determination.  
        
       
     32 Before proceeding to examine what Greg James J said in regard to the issues raised by this ground of appeal, I draw attention to the procedure contemplated by s 13A.  
      
       
     33 Section 13A(3) deals with eligibility to make an application for a determination. It provides that a person, who is the subject of a non-release recommendation, is not eligible to make an application for a determination unless that person has served at least 20 years of the sentence concerned.  
      
       
     34 Section 13A(3A) deals with eligibility “for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term”. This is a different concept to eligibility to make an application for a determination.  
      
       
     35 By s 13A(3A) a person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the determination of a minimum and additional term unless the Court “is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination”. 
      
       
     36 It follows therefore that the first step in the process is to determine the eligibility of the applicant to make an application. If the applicant is so eligible, the second step is to determine whether, by virtue of the existence of special reasons, the applicant is eligible for the determination of a minimum and additional term. The third step is to make the determination. 
      
       
     37 Section 13(3A)(8) provides that if the Court declines to determine a minimum and additional term, it may direct that the applicant never re-apply under s 13A or not re-apply for a specified period. It follows that it is only after the Court declines to make a determination that it would consider whether to make a direction under s 13A(8). 
      
       
     38 I now turn to the approach adopted by Greg James J. 
      
       
     39 At the outset it is to be noted that the appellant accepted that the sentencing remarks of Taylor J constituted a non-release recommendation. In the circumstances, by s 13A(3), the appellant was only eligible to make an application for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term if he had served at least 20 years of his sentence. It was common ground, however, that he had indeed served more than 20 years of his sentence. Therefore, there was no question before Greg James J as to whether the appellant was eligible to make an application for a determination.  
      
       
     40 His Honour said (para 69) that it was important “to identify what matters are said to amount to the special reasons which it is submitted justify making the determination”. The learned judge then proceeded to identify those reasons and he discussed these in detail. 
      
       
     41 His Honour then said (at para 123): 
      
       
        
         
         “Having regard to the appropriateness of the sentence that should be passed, now, on this applicant for the crimes he has committed even with the knowledge of the man he now is, applying to the consideration of this application the approach referred to in  
         Cribb  
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 November 1994) and the other authorities to which I have referred, but having regard to the statutory criteria as are applicable to an application commenced when this application was, I conclude that, notwithstanding the reasons asserted, the applicant is ineligible for the determination sought”. 
         
        
       
     42 Inasmuch as there was no contest as to whether the appellant was eligible to make an application as provided by s 13A(3), and as the “statutory criteria” to which his Honour referred were the “special reasons” under s 13A(3A), it seems plain that his Honour’s conclusion was that the appellant was “not eligible for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term” as provided by s 13A(3A). This is reinforced by the concluding words used by the judge in the passage quoted, namely,: 
      
       
        
         
         “I conclude that, notwithstanding the [special] reasons asserted, the applicant is ineligible for the determination sought”. 
         
        
       
     43 In the next paragraph of his Honour’s judgment he stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “I see no basis upon which I should give a direction either under subs (8)(a) or (b)”. 
         
        
        
       This, again, supports the conclusion that his Honour declined to determine a minimum term and an additional term as contemplated by s 13A(3A). As I have pointed out, a decision as to whether a direction should be given under subs (8) only arises after a decision has been made as to whether a determination of a minimum term and an additional term should be made. 
        
       
     44 The last two paragraphs of his Honour’s judgment do however give rise to some confusion and it is on these paragraphs on which the appellant relies. His Honour said in these paragraphs: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not clear to me that holding, as I have, that the applicant, by reason of failing to meet the requirements of subs (3) is not eligible to make such an application, that I should decline to make a determination, since subs (4) would only allow me to take that course on an application duly made for the determination. 
         
        
        
         
         I therefore declare that the applicant is not eligible to make the application”. 
         
        
       
     45 His Honour’s reference to the appellant failing to meet the requirements of subs (3) must be a typographical error. As I have said, it was common ground that the appellant was eligible under subs (3) to make the application. The question before Greg James J was whether the appellant was eligible under subs (3A).  
      
       
     46 The words “since subs (4) would only allow me to take that course on an application duly made for the determination” are ambiguous. A clue as to what his Honour meant by “an application duly made” is given by words used earlier by his Honour when discussing the term “special reasons”. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Without such special reasons, the person is not eligible for such a determination and, hence, the opening words of subs (4) which require the application to be duly made, are not satisfied”. 
         
        
        
       I understand the latter sentence to mean that, without the existence of special reasons, an application for a determination is not “duly made”. 
        
       
     47 It may be thought that an application is duly made if a person is eligible to make the application in terms of subs (3). Nevertheless, the sense of what his Honour was saying, in my view, is quite plain. In my view, when his Honour said that he should decline to make a determination because subs (4) would only allow him to take that course “on an application duly made for the determination”, his Honour was saying that he should decline to make the determination because special reasons did not exist justifying the making of a determination. 
      
       
     48 I accept that the declaration made in the last paragraph of his Honour’s reasons, namely, “that the applicant is not eligible to make the application”, emphasises the ambiguity to which I have adverted. Nevertheless, I consider that the reference to the “application” was an inadvertent error. In the light of the reasons as a whole, and the particular matters to which I have referred, I consider that his Honour intended to say that the applicant was not eligible for a determination of minimum term and an additional term.  
      
       
     49 Accordingly, I would not uphold the first argument. 
      
       
        
       The meaning of “special reasons” 
        
       
     50 The Act does not give any definition of the phrase “special reasons” in s 13A(3A). This and similar phrases - such as “special circumstances” or “special grounds” – are not infrequently found in legislation and, generally, courts do not have great difficulty in construing them. There is, however, in this case a particular problem as it is difficult to give real content to the meaning of the phrase.  
      
       
     51 It is first to be noticed that any person serving an existing life sentence may apply to the Court under s 13A for a determination of a minimum and additional term. The criteria referred to in subss (4A), (9) and (10A) apply to all such applications, that is, irrespective of whether or not the application is made by a person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation.  
      
       
     52 In other words, when an applicant is the subject of a non-release recommendation, the Court must take into account the very same factors as have to be considered when the applicant is not the subject of a non-release recommendation. The Court will be required to weigh identical factors in each case.  
      
       
     53 What then is meant by “special reasons”? In the context I have described, it seems to me that the phrase was intended to raise the threshold of satisfaction of the Court in deciding whether to make a determination of a minimum and additional term. Thus, reasons that, in the ordinary course, might persuade a court to make a determination, would be insufficient in the case of those subject to non-release recommendations. For persons in the latter category, the reasons must be “special”. In this sense, the reasons must be out of the ordinary, unusual, and not to be expected: cf United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 75 ALJR 1663 (at 1673), O’Hare v DPP (2000) NSWSC 430, B v Gould and DPP (1993) 67 A Crim R 297 at 300. 
      
       
     54 In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 Spigelman CJ said the following about the phrase “special circumstances” in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
        
         
         “59. The words ‘special circumstances’ appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. … 
         
        
        
         
         60. Statutory words of such generality usually lead courts to refuse to identify in advance a list of matters capable of satisfying the statutory formulation. Whilst certain considerations might not often be sufficiently ‘special’, so that an exceptional justification is required for them to attain the requisite statutory quality, nevertheless there may always be circumstances in which such a factor is of sufficient strength, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a conclusion that ‘special circumstances’ are made out on the facts of a particular case. It will be comparatively rare for an issue to arise in terms of a proposition that a particular circumstance is incapable, as a matter of law, of ever constituting a ‘special circumstance’”. 
         
        
       
     55 I do not think it necessary or desirable to make any further attempt to define the meaning of special reasons. I shall give some examples, however, of reasons that might conceivably be regarded as special. These are not intended to be in any way exhaustive. Particularly, meritorious service to prison authorities or other prisoners or to the broader community might be regarded as giving rise to a special reason. This kind of service might involve the giving of information leading to the recovery of stolen goods, or the apprehension of other criminals. Affording - to an unusual degree – psychological comfort and assistance to other prisoners could also qualify under the rubric. So could providing assistance – to an unusual degree – to prison authorities, generally. Any combination of reasons, whether intrinsically “special” or not, could amount to special reasons. It would often be a matter of degree. 
      
       
     56 As the rehabilitation of a prisoner is a goal of imprisonment, it would not ordinarily be regarded as a special reason. Not every prisoner is rehabilitated, but many are, and the mere fact of rehabilitation would not readily be regarded as “special”. On the other hand, the degree of rehabilitation may be so marked, or, rehabilitation, when coupled with other factors, may be so compelling as to give rise to “special reasons”. 
      
       
     57 Greg James J, in dealing with the meaning to be attributed to “special reasons”, said (at para 68): 
      
       
        
         
         “It would seem that the special reasons justifying the making of the determination must be such as would warrant not applying a non-release recommendation and accompanying comments that the offender is never to be released. In this case, bearing in mind those recommendations, observations and comments of the trial judge I have set out, the surrounding circumstances and other offences, to justify the determination, the reasons would have to be so powerful and, thus, special that it is not necessary for me to further consider the precise ambit of that term ‘special’ in this context. I cannot envisage reasons that could have such an effect which would not, in this context, be special”. 
         
        
        
       Later, his Honour said (at para 84): 
        
        
         
         “My not granting this application, however, may mean that the applicant would only practically be able to reapply in changed circumstances so powerful in effect, as to have that special character I have referred to as special reasons”. 
         
        
       
     58 The appellant submitted that the test enunciated by Greg James J was too demanding a burden to be placed on him and his Honour committed a fundamental error in this respect. 
      
       
     59 I accept that the adjective, “powerful”, is undesirable as it may suggest a standard more difficult to attain than “special”. In my view, however, in using the word, “powerful”, Greg James J was saying no more than that the special reasons needed to be so persuasive (in the light of the criteria laid down by s 13A) as to warrant the making of a determination. In my view, his Honour was merely attempting to express the notion of the higher standard required by Parliament in the case of persons subject to non-release recommendations. In other words, I consider that his Honour was using the adjective “powerful” in a sense synonymous with “special”.  
      
       
     60 On this basis, I do not think that his Honour erred in the test he applied. Moreover, when regard is had to the reasoning of his Honour which led him to the conclusion that he should decline to make a determination, no error is apparent.  
      
       
     61 Mr Zahra SC, senior counsel for the appellant, fairly conceded that in the particular circumstances a decision to decline to make a determination was within his Honour’s discretion. For my part, applying the test of “special reasons” in the sense that I have explained it, I would come to precisely the same conclusion as his Honour.  
      
       
     62 I think it appropriate to explain the conclusion set out in the last paragraph. This involves canvassing matters not raised by Mr Zahra in oral argument (although referred to in his written submissions). 
      
       
     63 In the written submissions it was submitted that there were four reasons that constituted special reasons within the meaning of s 13A(3A). These were: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Parity with Crump’s position following the determination of his life sentence. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The length of time in custody since arrest, together with Mr Baker’s youth as at the offence. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Rehabilitation and low risk of recidivism. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The reduction by the legislature of the maximum penalty for conspiracy to murder (from life to 25 years) since Mr Bakers conviction.” 
         
        
       
     64 In my view there is no relevant parity between the appellant and Crump. I have drawn attention to the evidence that demonstrated that the appellant was the dominant figure in the commission of the offences. The evidence reveals that the degree of criminality on his part was significantly greater than that of Crump and this was the finding of McInerney J. 
      
       
     65 Additionally, the legislation governing applications for determinations of minimum and additional terms were significantly different when Crump made his application to McInerney J. Firstly, there was no requirement as to special reasons. Secondly, McInerney J accepted that, in deciding whether or not to make a determination, he was required only to have regard to the seriousness of the offence of murder and should not take into account the criminality involved in the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse. 
      
       
     66 In the circumstances I consider that the principles of parity have no application. 
      
       
     67 I now come to “the length of time in custody since arrest, together with Mr Baker’s youth as at the offence”. The appellant has been in custody since 13 November 1973. At the time of the judgment of Greg James J a period of some 27 ½ years had passed since he was first incarcerated. The appellant was born on 16 January 1948. At the time of the offences he was aged 24 years 10 months. I do not regard these matters as constituting special reasons. They are simply ordinary and inevitable consequences of the fact that the appellant committed the offences at a relatively young age. 
      
       
     68 As regards rehabilitation and the low risk of recidivism, Greg James J found that (at para 122): 
      
       
        
         
         “[i]t may be accepted, in the light of all that material, that with proper management within the prison community prior to any release, the risk of future dangerousness or recidivism is very low. Indeed, the prospect of rehabilitation is very good”. 
         
        
       
     69 For the reasons I have stated, I do not accept that successful rehabilitation, a very low risk to the safety of the community and a very low risk of re-offending are special reasons. After all, these consequences are the very aims of imprisonment. True it is that in many cases rehabilitation to a marked degree is not achieved and the risk of re-offending remains. Nevertheless, there are many cases where prisoners undergo marked changes of personality and attitude, where the prison system does achieve rehabilitation, and where the risk of re-offending is nil or almost nil. These matters, on their own, or in combination with each other (and without regard to any other significant reason) in my view, do not constitute special reasons. 
      
       
     70 I do not accept that the reduction by the legislature of the maximum penalty for conspiracy to murder (from life to 25 years) since the appellant’s conviction constitutes special reasons. The essential criminality of the appellant’s conduct in regard to the offence against Mrs Morse remains unaltered. 
      
       
     71 I should also say, that, in my opinion, when the matters relied on by the appellant are taken together they do not amount to special reasons. The combination of these matters cannot be regarded as being out of the ordinary.  
      
       
     72 Accordingly, I would not accept the second argument raised on the appellant’s behalf. 
      
       
        
       The invalidity of the legislation 
        
       
     73 It was submitted on the appellant’s behalf that s 13A has the effect of vesting functions in the Court that are incompatible with or repugnant to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by the Supreme Court.  
      
       
     74 It was not disputed that in making a determination of a minimum and additional terms under s13A(4) this Court would be exercising Federal jurisdiction for the reasons expressed by Toohey J in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51 (at 94 to 96). 
      
       
        
       The court as an administrative agent of the legislature 
        
       
     75 The appellant’s first argument under this ground was that the challenged legislation makes it impossible for a person subject to a non-release recommendation to obtain ultimate release from prison. It was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the test for ‘special reasons’ is not [remedial] but in reality is a test which is impossible of practical attainment, then it is submitted that the real purpose behind the legislation is not to ensure that a certain category of persons serving life sentences have some prospect, in a real sense, of having those sentences determined but rather is a mechanism for ensuring precisely the opposite”. 
         
        
       
     76 I accept that if the legislation is a mere charade that does not, in truth, require the judicial function to be performed, the statute will be invalid. This would be the case if “special reasons” could never reasonably be established. In that event, the court would merely act as an administrative arm of the legislature to ensure that a person subject to a non-release recommendation would remain in prison.  
      
       
     77 In my view, however, on the construction of “special reasons” that I have propounded, it is indeed reasonably open for an applicant subject to a non-release recommendation to prove that special reasons justifying a determination under s 13A(4) exist. I do not accept, therefore, that the legislation is a device by Parliament to ensure that persons such as the appellant would never be released from prison. I would not uphold this argument.  
      
       
     78 The appellant argued next that the legislation altered a pre-existing sentencing regime to make it significantly more difficult for a particular category of persons to obtain ultimate release. Again, it was submitted that the true intention of the legislation was to ensure that the appellant (and the others who were subject to non-release recommendations) would never be released from gaol.  
      
       
     79 In essence, this argument is closely allied to the first argument, namely, that based on the proposition that the test for special reasons is impossible of practical attainment. Underlying this contention is the proposition that the procedure required by s 13A(3A) and (4) involves the court being used merely to cloak refusals of s 13A(4) applications with an illusion of due process and probity. 
      
       
     80 The first element of this argument is that some significance flows from the fact that the Amending Act altered a pre-existing sentencing regime. 
      
       
     81 Prior to the Amending Act, the appellant had no accrued right to make an application for a determination. As Studdert J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart J agreed) said in the appeal from the judgment of Sully J refusing the appellant’s application for a determination of his life sentence (see R v Baker unreported, NSWCCA, 23 May 1994 (at p 9)): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that the majority of the applications made pursuant to s 13A(4) of the Sentencing Act thus far have proved successful. However, obviously each case must be considered on its merits and an applicant for a determinate sentence has no automatic entitlement under the section as indeed s 13A(4(d) recognises: the Court may ‘decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term’”. 
         
        
       
     82 No authority has been submitted to the Court that supports the proposition that the State Parliament is not empowered to alter sentencing laws applicable to existing offenders. There is no reason in principle that precludes Parliament from so legislating. In my view, it is irrelevant that, prior to the Amending Act, there was no requirement for special reasons.  
      
       
     83 I turn next to the argument based on difficulty of proof. 
      
       
     84 I do not accept that proof of special reasons is so difficult as to have the practical result that persons subject to non-release recommendations will never be released from prison. I have given examples of factors that could constitute special reasons and I have pointed out that a combination of reasons, even if none is independently “special”, may constitute special reasons. I repeat my opinion that it is reasonably open for an applicant subject to a non-release recommendation to prove that special reasons exist, justifying a determination under s 13A(4). 
      
       
     85 In my view, a determination of minimum and additional terms in relation to a person subject to a non-release recommendation involves the making of a decision in accordance with the customary judicial method. By s 13A(4) read with s 13A(3A) the Court is required to undertake a traditional and familiar judicial exercise, namely, the determination of the existence of factors which condition the power of the Court to afford relief to persons falling within a defined category. Having found that the factors exist, the Court is required to exercise a judicial discretion in determining whether relief should be granted. The argument that the legislation requires the court to be a tool of the legislature is far-fetched.  
      
       
        
       Usurpation of judicial power 
        
       
     86 The appellant argued next that, by the Amending Act, Parliament was seeking, impermissibly, to dictate how the power of judicial discretion would operate (see Kirby J in Nicholas v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 173 at 257). This, it was submitted, constituted an impermissible usurpation of judicial power. 
      
       
     87 There can be no question, as I have already stated, that the determination of the existence of special reasons requires the court to make a judgment in the traditional way and then to exercise its discretion. The appellant’s real complaint under this head, it seems to me, is that, by the legislation, Parliament has altered the weight to be attached to the relevant factors the court is required to assess when making such a determination.  
      
       
     88 I have expressed the view that special reasons are reasons that are unusual, out of the ordinary and not to be expected. I have concluded that the rehabilitation that often results from long-term incarceration would not, on its own, be regarded as special as this consequence is one of the very goals of imprisonment and is not extraordinary. Thus the requirement of special reasons reduces the value that would otherwise be attributed to rehabilitation and remorse when making a determination under s 13A(4) involving a person subject to a non-release recommendation. At the same time, the special reasons requirement (read with the whole of s13A) has the effect of shoring up the importance to be attached to the gravity of the crime and the views of the original sentencing judge.  
      
       
     89 It follows that, by introducing the requirement of special reasons, Parliament has made legislative provisions that affect the relative importance to be given to particular factors to be taken into account in the sentencing process.  
      
       
     90 The common law recognises the fundamental principle of proportionality in sentencing which “does not permit the increase of a sentence of imprisonment beyond what is proportional to the crime merely for the purpose of extending the protection of society from the recidivism of the offender” (Chester v R (1988) 165 CLR 611 (at 618)). It does not follow, however, that legislation altering this common law rule is invalid.  
      
       
     91 A similar exercise of legislative power takes place when Parliaments legislate for various forms of preventative detention. In such legislation, Parliament overrides the common law principles of proportionality of sentence. Nevertheless, such legislation is recognised as being valid.  
      
       
     92 For example, in R v Moffatt [1998] 2 V.R. 229 Winneke P said (at 234): 
      
       
        
         
          “It is, of course, one thing to accept that the legislation can be criticised because it invests the court with power to impose a sentence which offends contemporary sentencing standards, and does so in terms which raise difficulties of construction; it is an entirely different thing to conclude that it is beyond the power of the State legislature to invest its courts with such a discretion.” 
         
        
        
       And went on (at 238) to remark: 
        
        
         
         “Indeed it seems to me to be implicit in the reasoning in  
         Kable’s  
         case that the investing in a court of a power to impose an indeterminate sentence as a consequence of the commission of a serious act of violence is within the power of the State legislatures: see per Toohey J (at 97); McHugh J (at 121). 
         
        
        
         
         As McHugh J said (at 121): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘…. there is no reason to doubt the authority of the State to make general laws for preventive detention when those laws operate in accordance with the ordinary judicial processes of the State Courts’.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       In the same case Hayne JA said (at 251): 
        
        
         
         “It may be accepted that the common law does not sanction preventive detention and that the imposition of an indefinite sentence cuts across well recognised and established principles of proportionality. 
         
        
        
         
          
         But the existence of these common law principles does not mean that the legislature may not provide that the courts may impose indefinite sentences in certain circumstances on persons found guilty of offences or even go so far as to require the courts to impose such sentences on such persons. Leaving aside questions of incompatibility of legislation with the Commonwealth Constitution, the power of the State Parliaments to make laws with respect to sentencing offenders is not fettered. It may be that Dicey’s precept that Parliament is sovereign is not a sufficient answer to every question concerning the limits of State legislative power, but there is, in my view, no basis for concluding that a State Parliament cannot, by suitably worded legislation, determine what kinds of a sentence may be imposed and, if thought fit, change the principles to be applied by courts in sentencing offenders for crime”. 
          
         
        
       
     93 The legislation presently under consideration does not intrude into the essential judicial function of exercising, impartially, an objective and independent discretion. The court is not required to exercise power in a manner that is inconsistent with the judicial process: see Kable at 98 per Toohey J. The Act does not compromise the institutional impartiality of the court, nor does it undermine the ordinary safeguards of the judicial process: see Kable at 121 per McHugh J. Nothing that the court is required to do by the legislation would cause any loss of confidence in the judicial process. In my view, the introduction of the requirement of special reasons did not usurp judicial power.  
      
       
       The limited number of persons affected by the special reasons requirement  
        
       
     94 It is common ground that the special reasons requirement under s 13A(3A) has application to a very limited number of prisoners, namely, it is said, nine. These are the prisoners subject to non-release recommendations. Mr Zahra argued that, for this reason, the special reasons requirement should be categorised as ad hominem legislation that results in unequal justice.  
      
       
     95 At the outset it is to be noted that the mere fact that legislation is aimed at a small number of persons does not make it invalid.  
      
       
     96 In Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth (War Crimes Act Case) (1991) 172 CLR 501 (at 689) Toohey J said in regard to the War Crimes legislation considered in that case (which applied to a limited number of potential offenders): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is only if a law purports to operate in such a way as to require a court to act contrary to accepted notions of judicial power that a contravention of Ch III may be involved”. 
         
        
        
       The legislation was held not to be invalid. 
        
       
     97 In Nicholas v The Queen the legislation under consideration concerned relatively few persons (according to Kirby J, the number was five – see at 250). Nevertheless, the legislation was held not to be invalid. Hayne J in referring to the fact that the legislation applied to only a small group of cases, said (at 277): 
      
       
        
         
         “First, however, it is to be noted that the legislation deals only with the reception of evidence; it does not deal directly with issues of guilt or innocence of any offence charged against those in whose prosecutions the evidence may be led. Secondly, the mere fact that it may be possible to identify all the persons in relation to whom s 15X applies does not mean that the legislation interferes with the judicial power. Where legislation deals only with events which have happened before the legislation comes into effect, it must always be possible, at least theoretically, to identify all cases to which the legislation may apply; the events have happened and can, in theory, be identified. That has not hitherto been seen as a sufficient reason to conclude that the legislation is invalid … The number of cases affected may be a relevant consideration but I doubt that it is a sure guide to validity and I do not rest my decision only on whether the provisions which are now under consideration affect five or six persons rather than one or two (or five or six rather than 500 or 600). For present purposes it is enough to say that because the legislation does not deal directly with ultimate issues of guilt or innocence but only with whether evidence of only one of several elements of an offence can be received and deals not with a single identified, or identifiable, prosecution but with several prosecutions (albeit prosecutions which I assume can be identified and are relatively few) it does not have the character of a bill of attainder or like impermissible interference in the judicial process.” 
          
         
        
       
     98 The provisions relating to a determination of minimum and additional terms in relation to persons subject to non-release recommendations, similarly, do not have the character of a bill of attainder or like impermissible interference in the judicial process. 
      
       
     99 The Amending Act does not prejudge issues with respect to particular individuals and require the court to act accordingly (cf the remarks of Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ in Leeth v Commonwealth (1992) 174 CLR 455 at 469 to 470 when dealing with an argument based on Liyanage v The Queen (1967) 1 AC 259, similar to that advanced by the appellant). The legislation does not require the court to act contrary to accepted notions of judicial power (cf Toohey J in Polyukhovich at 689) and is vastly different to that in Liyanage v The Queen. It does not “legislate ex post facto the detention of particular persons charged with particular offences on a particular occasion” (per Toohey J in Nicholas at 203). It does not bring down “a “legislative judgment” directed against specific individuals; it does not “serve to inflict punishment on specified persons without a judicial trial or to adjudge criminal guilt,” and it does not direct the court “not to make a finding concerning rights or duties that an accused person would otherwise be entitled to under the existing law or to change the direction or outcome of pending judicial proceedings” (see the remarks of McHugh J in Nicholas at 221). Nor does it direct the court to disregard facts that are critical in exercising a discretion that is necessary to protect the integrity of the courts and to maintain public confidence in the administration of criminal justice (see the further remarks of McHugh J in Nicholas at 221). In my view it neither infringes the requirements of equal justice nor prevents the independent determination of the matter in issue (see Gaudron J in Nicholas at 212). 
      
       
     100 Accordingly, in my view, the mere fact that the legislation applies only to nine persons does not make it invalid. 
      
       
        
       Arbitrary aspects of the non-release recommendation category and the assertion of inequality before the law 
        
       
     101 Mr Zahra submitted that the qualification for the category of those subject to the non-release recommendations was based upon an arbitrary decision by a sentencing judge to describe the offender as not being suitable for future release. He pointed out that this was a categorisation that did not have the force of law; it did not form part of the sentencing process at the time and no appeal lay against it. Further, he submitted that it is apparent from the parliamentary debate on the subject that the impetus behind the Amending Act was the determination by McInerney J of a minimum term and an additional term in regard to the sentence imposed on Crump. Finally, under this head, he argued that the categorisation has not been applied evenly by Supreme Court judges; he submitted that a significant number of offenders sentenced before January 1990, whose criminality equals or exceeds that of the appellant, avoided such a recommendation being made due to the sentencing approach of the judge concerned. 
      
       
     102 I accept that the qualification for the category of those subject to the non-release recommendations is based upon a statement made arbitrarily by a sentencing judge (in the sense that the judge was not bound to make such a statement and the statement, when made, did not have the force of law). It is correct that such a statement did not form part of the sentencing process at the time and no appeal lay against it. I accept that the criteria in question may lead to uneven consequences. I also accept that the decision of McInerney J played a large part in Parliament deciding to enact the Amending Act. It is correct that there has been inconsistency in the making of non-release recommendations. 
      
       
     103 It is to be borne in mind, however, that the persons the subject of non-release recommendations are all persons who committed crimes of the most serious nature and who, at the time of sentencing, constituted a real and serious danger to the safety of the community. They are persons in respect of whom the sentencing judge in each case was moved to make a non-release recommendation. Thus, the definition of the category of persons subject to a non-release recommendation involves an expression of a judicial view, based upon the circumstances of the particular case.  
      
       
     104 In any event, I do not regard the arbitrary nature and other criticisms of the category of persons subject to non-release recommendations as being relevant to the validity of the legislation in question. 
      
       
     105 It cannot be gainsaid that persons subject to non-release recommendations are persons who have committed appalling crimes. There is no principle of law that prevents Parliament from identifying such persons by reference to criteria that, while arbitrary, have a real connection with the gravity of their offences and enacting sentencing laws applicable to them. If Parliament requires the courts to treat persons in such a way that one particular law is to have different consequences for different individuals, that might well constitute unequal treatment before the law. But that is not the case with the challenged legislation. 
      
       
     106 Essentially, the appellant’s complaints go to the fairness of the legislation. Ordinarily, that is no concern of the court. Tangentially, questions of fairness may be relevant when the court has to make a value judgment in determining whether legislation impermissibly infringes the judicial power (per Kirby J in Nicholas at 263). That value judgment, however, has to be made in the light of the following criteria, stated by Gaudron J in Nicholas (at 208-209): 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view, consistency with the essential character of a court and with the nature of judicial power necessitates that a court not be required or authorised to proceed in a manner that does not ensure equality before the law, impartiality and the appearance of impartiality, the right of a party to meet the case made against him or her, the independent determination of the matter in controversy by application of the law to facts determined in accordance with rules and procedures which truly permit the facts to be ascertained and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the determination of guilt or innocence by means of a fair trial according to law. It means, moreover, that a court cannot be required or authorised to proceed in any manner which involves an abuse of process, which would render its proceedings inefficacious, or which brings or tends to bring the administration of justice into disrepute”. 
          
         
        
        
       The matters on which Mr Zahra relied do not go to issues of the kind referred to by her Honour. As I have said, in substance, those matters amount to a criticism of the merits of the legislation, rather than the effect of the legislation on the court. 
        
       
     107 In the circumstances, I would not uphold the argument raised under this head by the appellant.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     108 I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     109 DUNFORD J: In this case I have had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgment of Ipp AJA. I agree with the order proposed and with his Honour’s reasons.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed on the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales at Gosford in consequence of the applicant having pleaded guilty to one count under s.25 A(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The particulars of the charge were that he had supplied a prohibited drug, that is methyldioxide methylamphetamine (MDMA) between the 23 March and 23 April 2001 at West Gosford on three or more occasions. That offence is commonly referred to as the offence of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. It is punishable under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 by the imposition of 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty units or both. 
      
       
     2 In addition the trial judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1, two counts of supply, one being between the 22 April and 6 June 2001 of methyl dioxide, methyl amphetamine (MDMA), the other being the supply between 5 and 6 June 2001 of cannabis to the value only of $20 but to a school girl and a further offence of possession of 1.8 grams of cannabis located when his premises were searched at the time of his arrest. 
      
       
     3 The maximum penalty for the Form 1 offence of deemed supply of the MDMA is 15 years imprisonment. That for the supply of the cannabis is 10 years imprisonment. In the event that the possession matter had been dealt with by a Local Court it would have been punishable by a maximum of two years imprisonment. 
      
       
     4 The applicant was born on 4 September 1981. He had just turned 20 at the time of sentence. He was 19 at the time the offences were committed. They were committed through an intermediary who dealt with an undercover police agent engaged in the prosecution of a controlled operation. 
      
       
     5 That intermediary in dealing with the undercover police agent indicated his sources of supply of the MDMA, and it was discovered that one of those sources was the offender. 
      
       
     6 On 3 April 2001 the applicant met with the intermediary at a carpark in Kariong and supplied him with 10 MDMA tablets which the intermediary in turn supplied to the undercover officer on 10 April 2001. The applicant met with the intermediary in the vicinity of Racecourse Road, West Gosford and supplied the intermediary with 200 MDMA tablets which were then supplied by that intermediary to that undercover officer on 19 April 2001. 
      
       
     7 The applicant met the undercover officer after arrangements had been made by the intermediary and supplied 40 MDMA tablets to the undercover officer for $1,500. There were before the trial judge in evidence on the plea of guilty transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations confirming the applicant's supply of the MDMA and cannabis between 22 March and 6 June 2001 on the Central Coast as charged in the Form 1. 
      
       
     8 In particular the transcripts made reference to the arrangements to supply MDMA tablets to the intermediary and the cannabis to the school girl. 
      
       
     9 The applicant was sentenced by the learned trial judge to a period of imprisonment of four years commencing on 22 November 2001 and expiring on 21 November 2005, a non-parole period of two years to commence on 22 November 2001 was imposed. 
      
       
     10 The applicant had apparently been in custody for one week at the time of the trial judge passing sentence. The trial judge found special circumstances, and in particular found those as lying in the applicant's age, the difficulties he will face in custody, in that he will serve the entire custodial portion of his sentence in protection, and the need for lengthy supervised rehabilitation. 
      
       
     11 The trial judge recommended that the applicant be placed in an institution, which did not expose him to hardened criminals or place him at risk. The trial judge made a number of findings concerning the applicant's criminality. In particular she referred to the applicant as being a person of prior good record, who was seen as a high achiever with high material expectations. 
      
       
     12 The findings she made in this regard were based upon the pre-sentence report provided to her. The applicant did not give evidence. No challenge however was made to her Honour relying upon what was contained in that report. In that report a history was set out of the applicant actively avoiding drug taking until a relationship with his girlfriend broke down. He suffered a hand injury, was laid off work, and apparently turned to drugs. 
      
       
     13 There was reference in the report to his turn to drugs being linked to his being laid off at work. Her Honour was somewhat skeptical about that matter since there did not appear to be the same coincidence referred to, of the absence of work and drug dealing, in the telephone intercepts. 
      
       
     14 Her Honour found, based on the material in the report that he was a person who had expressed regret at letting his family and himself down; that there was a job available upon his release from custody; that his family stood by him and all looked well for rehabilitation. 
      
       
     15 However her Honour rejected the matter put to her in the Probation and Parole report that the offence of the 10 April 2001 involving the sale of the 200 MDMA tablets was the applicant's ""first and only involvement in a large scale supply of drugs"" which came about at the behest of the undercover police officer. Up until that time he was selling small quantities to friends. 
      
       
     16 The trial judge found that on the evidence contained in the recorded telephone discussions the applicant was actively involved in an operation to supply illicit drugs on an ongoing basis, was aware of the consequences of being caught, and was also aware of the existence of the undercover police on the Central Coast. 
      
       
     17 She found that he was a user/dealer but not a user to a large extent, he having a habit of only $100 per week. That extent of his habit was referred to in the pre-sentence report. 
      
       
     18 The trial judge concluded that the applicant was operating at a greater level of criminality than a simple user/dealer, although he did not have the indicia of wealth of bigger drug dealers. She accepted what she was told by his counsel that he had spent the monies he had obtained from the drug dealing on funding his own habit and general living, no doubt attempting to persuade his girlfriend not to leave him. 
      
       
     19 There was no challenge before us to those findings although it was contended on his behalf that her Honour having rejected his account that the one large transaction referred to in the evidence was his first and only involvement in such a transaction, she had impliedly concluded that he had involved himself in other large transactions. 
      
       
     20 Her remarks on sentence do not bear this proposition out. Nor does she at any stage indicate that there has been on his part any large scale dealing. The closest her Honour comes to suggesting any such thing is when she later in her remarks says, ""whilst the quantities in which he dealt were initially small, when a larger quantity was sought he was both willing and able to obtain a supply to meet that order.” That is plainly a reference to the supply of the 200 tablets on 19 April 2001 itself, rather than other large transactions. 
      
       
     21 She had regard to the schedule tendered of the quantities either supplied or agreed to be supplied, so that the offences should be seen in context, that is part as part of an ongoing supply. Later she says, ""I cannot overlook the objective seriousness of the ongoing supply of methyl dioxide, methyl amphetamine in increasing quantities"". It was contended that having regard to the principles in The Queen v. Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, her Honour had fallen into error in concluding there was a greater criminality than the evidence supported. 
      
       
     22 It was also submitted that she had erred in failing to accept that the large scale transaction was one that had been suggested to the applicant by the police, and that suggestion had the effect of inflating the true level of criminality, and was out of accord with the ordinary course of what the applicant had done as being a much larger transaction than to those to which he would otherwise have been a party. 
      
       
     23 That submission however founders entirely when one has regard to the willingness with which the applicant embarked upon the larger dealing, and has regard only to the individual circumstances of that sale rather than to the willingness with which the applicant had apparently so dealt in the context of the activities he had carried on for some time. 
      
       
     24 It was also submitted that the sentence, having regard to the applicant serving that sentence on protection, his youth, this being the first full-time custodial sentence; and the objective circumstances of the sales was manifestly excessive. It was submitted that the sentence passed was plainly excessive in that her Honour was of the view that his early plea on contrition required a discount of some 20% of the sentence that would otherwise have been passed. It was submitted that this meant that the trial judge must have commenced the consideration of the appropriate sentence at a figure of some five years and four months. That would indicate a component for the offences taken into account which was extremely large having regard to their criminality, or that the sentence overall simply commenced with an initial sentence that was far in excess of the totality of criminality for all the matters. 
      
       
     25 I do not agree that such a submission is soundly based. Far too often there is put to this court the proposition that the end product of a sentencing exercise, may be recalculated back to detect a foundation error even though that matter does not necessarily translate on analysis through to the conclusion. 
      
       
     26 What this court is concerned to deal with under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is the final sentence. Provided that that sentence is not attended by error of law, and unless some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed, then the court's function on appeal is to uphold the exercise of discretion by the trial judge. 
      
       
     27 In this case having regard particularly to the applicant's expressed desire to live for the future a drug free life, to the shock effect referred to in the pre-sentence report upon him, on his family of his conviction and sentence, the court would wish to encourage him in the rehabilitation it would hope the sentence would produce. 
      
       
     28 But that rehabilitation cannot be gained at the expense of an appropriate denunciation of the crimes the applicant has committed and the upholding of a decision of the trial judge to pass a sentence which accords with law. 
      
       
     29 I would conclude therefore that leave to appeal should be granted, the matter having been fully argued, but that the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     30 SMART, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     31 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales in consequence of he, in that court, having confirmed his pleas of guilty, originally made in the Local Court, to two offences under s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900 of robbery in company. He had been committed in the local court for sentence in the District Court pursuant to s.51A of the Justices Act 1902. 
      
       
     2 The two offences were committed on 23 May 2001 at Frenchs Forest when one victim was robbed of certain property: a mobile phone, some cash, a driver's licence and some other personal cards. Later that day, another victim was robbed of some $30 in cash by the same three assailants who had participated in the first offence. Those offences are regarded by the law as most serious. The maximum penalty prescribed in each case is imprisonment for 20 years. 
      
       
     3 The short facts of the offences as found by the trial judge were based upon the tender in evidence without objection - and apparently at the time of tender unchallenged - of a police-prepared facts sheet. 
      
       
     4 I now summarise what is contained in the remarks on sentence. The offender and two companions, (two juveniles at the time) at about 4.00 pm on 23 May 2001, were in a vehicle driven by another young person. They were all four friends and resided in areas that the trial judge referred to in the remarks on sentence. They drove to Frenchs Forest and were looking for young persons to rob. The first victim was walking home at about 4.10 pm that afternoon. The driver stopped the car near him, the applicant and the two co-offenders got out of the car and followed him. The driver drove around the block. The victim was approached by the applicant who said, ""give me your money and give me your phone"". The victim was pushed and spun around by one of the co-accused. He was then kicked and punched to the body and head a number of times and forced to the ground. One of the other young men who had left the car, took the victim's mobile phone and wallet from his jeans pocket. The victim was punched and kicked for between one and two minutes and afterwards came to his feet in a dazed state, returned home and contacted the police. He suffered soreness to the back of his head, soreness to his ribs and back, and his eyes and cheeks. 
      
       
     5 Shortly after this attack, the offenders, having resumed their cruise of the streets of Frenchs Forest at 4.25pm, located a 17 year old male teenager walking and the vehicle slowed. The applicant then followed the victim and said to him, ""Mate, do you have 15 bucks?"". The victim replied, ""No, I've got no money"", and fearing for his safety jumped over a fence and began to run away. However, his Honour recorded:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""He was grabbed by the offender, was pushed to the ground and the offender then jumped on to him. The victim was punched between seven and 12 times to the head while pleading, 'take the money. Just don't take my wallet'"". 
         
        
       
     6 The co-offenders began to search through the victim's pocket. He was asked for a phone. He was lying face down on the ground and was told not to turn around. When he turned his head slightly he was punched to the left side of his head. His pockets were gone through and his wallet was eventually thrown back towards him with another statement, ""don't turn around"". After the car and the offenders had driven away, the victim found his father who reported the matter to police. 
      
       
     7 The car was seen still driving in Frenchs Road, Frenchs Forest shortly after the second robbery. It was stopped by police. The four occupants were arrested, and found wedged in a rear passenger seat was the mobile phone belonging to the first victim. 
      
       
     8 When the applicant was taken to the Manly Police Station he declined to be interviewed and declined to participate in an identification parade but was videoed so that a record could be made of his appearance at the time. The other offenders were also videoed for that purpose. 
      
       
     9 The second victim said that as a result of the attack upon him, the back of his head was swollen, he had a lump and cuts to the front of his head, and a swollen right index finger and had a terrible headache. Not surprisingly the trial judge was not sure that his bare recital of the events adequately conveyed the feeling of terror that both of the victims must have felt at the unprovoked assaults upon them. 
      
       
     10 On the basis of these facts, the trial judge concluded that the two crimes were very serious indeed, marked as they were by considerable violence to young victims who were simply walking along, minding their own business and chosen by the offenders at random. The trial judge referred to the seriousness with which the law regards the conduct of persons who attack, beat and rob others in packs, choosing their victims at random, and referred to the necessity that severe sentences be imposed. The trial judge equated the vulnerability of these victims to the vulnerable shopkeeper or taxi driver victims referred to in the decision of CCA in Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, a guideline judgment. 
      
       
     11 His Honour adverted to the considerable degree of actual violence involved in these offences when having regard to the profile of the offender referred to in Henry (supra) and the range of sentences there suggested by the guidelines. 
      
       
     12 The trial judge, having adverted to the applicant's subjective circumstances which were established by a pre-sentence report, his own evidence, and the evidence of his mother, and also the report from a family therapist, adverted also to the plea of guilty for which the applicant received a significant discount; his youth, it only being a few months after his 18th birthday when he committed the offences; and found special circumstances, in particular, because of the applicant's need for continued counselling over an extended period to deal with his own personal anger management issues and referring to matters indicated in the pre-sentence report. His Honour referred to this sentence as being the first time the applicant would serve in a gaol. 
      
       
     13 His Honour sentenced the applicant to concurrent sentences of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years, directing release on expiration of the non-parole period on condition the applicant submits to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obeys their directions, particularly concerning the anger management course and other such relevant programmes as recommended. His Honour had said, when enunciating his reason for taking that course, that he had taken into account the fact that the applicant was just short of his 18th birthday, and were it not for that fact, his Honour would have been minded to consider an appropriate starting point for calculating the relevant sentences as a sentence of imprisonment for six years in each case. 
      
       
     14 Before us it is contended that his Honour erred in a number of ways. Firstly, that his Honour failed to have regard to the evidence that the applicant gave before him concerning the role the applicant had performed in the second robbery. The applicant had admitted speaking to the first victim and demanding his property. He denied, however, speaking to the second victim and demanding his property. He contended that one of the co-accused had spoken to him and that upon being spoken to, the victim turned and ran, and more or less trapped himself down the hill; that the other boys had pursued him, were on top of him and were fighting with him. It was one of the other boys that had taken the property. The applicant had said, ""I didn't touch the bloke"". The applicant had confirmed that in cross-examination. 
      
       
     15 It was contended that notwithstanding counsel before the trial judge did not take explicit issue with the statement of facts, there being that evidence before the trial judge, it was incumbent upon his Honour to reject what was in the statement of facts and to accept the account given in evidence by the applicant. It is notable that apparently it was not sought that the victim be cross-examined, although the victim's statement was tendered and appeared to found the inference that the offender's conduct was as set out in the statement of facts if he was otherwise identified. 
      
       
     16 However, as I have said, the applicant did not give a record of interview or attend an identification parade. It is notable that there appeared to be no necessity in the court below for the video of his appearance to which I have referred to be tendered in evidence as being capable of establishing what the assailant in the second offence wore and thereby enabling the applicant's contention to be tested by what was contained in the victim's statement concerning the clothing of the men and the roles that they performed when he was attacked. 
      
       
     17 In my view, the ground of criticism of the learned trial judge's finding is not made out, but even if it had been, it does not appear to me that considering the evidence given by the applicant, that he, in conjunction with the other three, sought to pick out victims at random to assault in this way and that all were prepared to accept complicity in this manner of attack would have meant that there was much by way of mitigation even if his evidence was accepted and certainly not any mitigation to be found in his standing by while others with whom he had linked himself in purpose, embarked upon this conduct. 
      
       
     18 In my view, there is no such matter by way of error of law as would warrant any interference with the trial judge's conclusions arising from what has been put in support of this ground, and in that regard, and in particular in regard to certain of the other criticisms, they being that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's attempts at rehabilitation and to various subjective factors. I reiterate, what this court has often said, that what one is concerned with in applications for leave to appeal against sentence is whether or not some such error as the High Court adverted to in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 is disclosed, so that one might conclude the sentencing discretion miscarried. Normally no such error is likely to be found in the assertion that the trial judge merely failed to give sufficient weight to a relevant matter, and I am of the view that in respect of these matters, no such error can be found here. 
      
       
     19 It was also contended that the trial judge erred in failing to give a sufficient discount in respect of the applicant's early plea of guilty. The trial judge adverted to the criteria set out in Henry (supra). One of the matters there referred to is a late plea of guilty. However in this case, the trial judge said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I take into account the offender's plea of guilty. I propose to give him a significant discount for his plea of guilty. Even though the Crown seems to have had quite a good case against him, it seems that the victims were in position to identify him and he was found as a passenger in the vehicle, as I have said, where the first victim's mobile phone was found. I propose to give him a significant discount for his plea of guilty, notwithstanding, the recent remarks of the High Court in  
         The Queen v Cameron 
         .” 
         
        
       
     20 That passage precedes the remarks made by his Honour to which I have referred concerning the relevance of the youth of the offender to his Honour's starting point for calculating the sentences at a sentence in each case of imprisonment for six years. It is conceded by Mr. Glennon, who has appeared for the applicant and has said on his behalf all that could be said, that the law does not require there to be an enunciation of a precise arithmetical kind of the degree of discount for the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     21 Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 merely requires that the court must take the fact of the plea into account. The court may, accordingly, impose a lesser penalty than would otherwise have imposed. If it does not, the court is required under s.22(2) to indicate to an offender and make a record of, its reasons for not imposing a lesser penalty. It has been said that there is a necessity that there be a discernible reflection of the benefit flowing to an offender who does plead guilty, thus demonstrating that there has been the application of legislative intent: Attorney General's Application (No 1); Regina v. Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327;  Regina v Thomson [2000] 49 NSWLR 383. This court encouraged judges to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence as far as those judges might believe it appropriate to do so, and to enunciate the factors to which the plea of guilty or the quantification of the plea of guilty had regard notably, of course, to the timing of the plea. 
      
       
     22 In Thomson (supra) reference was made to the utilitarian value of the plea being generally assessed in the range of 10 to 25% with reference particularly to its timing. In The Queen v. Cameron [2002] HCA at 6, it was pointed out that such a plea should appropriately be regarded not by reference to the utilitarian value, but with reference to its evidencing a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. However, that decision has been distinguished in relation to State offences by this court in Queen v. Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 which discriminates between matters of objective utility and matters which are subjective to the offender. 
      
       
     23 On an analysis of what the trial judge has said here, I do not see in the light of these cases that the trial judge has fallen into any error in concluding, as he did, that he would give a significant discount for the plea of guilty in the circumstances in which it was entered without expressing the amount of discount more precisely. Having regard to the offender's age and the plea, it is entirely apparent that he has given a significant discount so as to produce the sentence, which was in fact passed. I do not see that having regard to the guideline in Henry (supra) and having regard to the process of reasoning the trial judge undertook, nor in the context of the sentencing statistics that were provided to us, that the trial judge started the sentence calculations too high, particularly having regard to these four offenders deliberately cruising the street of a Sydney suburb determined to commit multiple offences punishable each by such a high maximum. 
      
       
     24 The submissions originally made to us were supplemented by an additional submission that the trial judge had erred in failing to give consideration to the imposition of either a community service order or periodic detention. These matters were raised in the pre-sentence report before his Honour. They were referred to also in the original submissions filed in this court but in the context of the applicant having put forward matters that supported the prospect of successful rehabilitation and that his Honour, the trial judge, had found the applicant had, since his arrest, ""made some real efforts towards his own rehabilitation"". 
      
       
     25 The judgment of the CCA in Henry (supra) makes it quite clear that in respect to the offences to which that judgment is applicable – that is armed robbery - it will only be in exceptional circumstances where other than a full time sentence of custody is appropriate. In my view, those remarks apply equally to the offence which is treated by the Crimes Act 1900 as akin to armed robbery, robbery in company. Thus, one would expect that in the event that the discretion to impose some sentence different in nature to that of full time custody were to be successfully invoked before the trial judge, that those exceptional features would be clearly delineated in evidence. 
      
       
     26 Here it is said that such features can be found in the prior good record and the prospects of rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the evaluation of those matters and the appropriateness of the sentence to be selected, both in nature and extent, is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. It is only where that exercise of discretion is in error of law or principle, or is manifestly unreasonable that the court is empowered to intervene applying the principles in House (supra). 
      
       
     27 The general sentencing principles the court must apply are now enunciated in s.21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They include a number of matters in addition to the individual prospects of rehabilitation. Regard must be had to them. Here the sentence imposed at first instance reflects them. 
      
       
     28 The trial judge, in the exercise of discretion and in balancing the application of those matters, was of the view - in my view appropriately - that deterrence and denunciation had important roles to play in the sentences and in that regard passed the sentences that he did. But when he had regard to special circumstances, what he sought to do was to limit the impact of what otherwise would have been an appropriate sentences for the subjective considerations appropriate to the offender and his prospect of rehabilitation. I consider that in that regard no criticism can be made of the non-parole period as being inappropriate. 
      
       
     29 I therefore conclude that the matter having been fully argued, leave to appeal should be granted but that in the upshot, the decision of the learned trial judge is not one to which s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies. I cannot conclude that some other sentence warranted in law should have been passed. I would therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     30 SMART, AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     31 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be therefore as I have proposed.

      REGINA v HEATHER SUZANNE TYLER 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 O'KEEFE J: Heather Suzanne Tyler (the applicant) was sentenced by Judge Kinchington (the judge) in the District Court on 15 February 2002 on a charge of having imported into Australia a commercial quantity of 34 methylenedioxi-methylamphetamine (commonly knows as ecstasy or MDMA) on 28 July 2001. 
      
       
     2 The sentence imposed was seven and a half years with a non-parole period of four and a half years. In addition an order was made under s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act for the forfeiture of $US500 that was found on the applicant at the time of her arrest. In fixing the sentence the judge took into account an offence of making a false statement in respect of a passport contrary to the Passports Act 1938. 
      
       
     3 The quantity of the drug involved was a gross weight of 3,426.3 grams. It was in the form of 13,917 tablets concealed in the false bottom of a sports bag which formed part of the applicant's luggage. 
      
       
     4 On analysis, the quantity of pure MDMA was found to be 947.6 grams. It had an estimated street value of between $695,850 to $974,190. A commercial quantity of MDMA is 500 grams. The maximum penalty provided for the importation is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of $750,000. 
      
       
     5 Whilst the applicant's luggage was being x-rayed, she was seen to deposit an Australian passport, which had been issued in her name, in a bin in the quarantine area. The applicant had previously declared that the passport so deposited had been stolen on 29 May 2001. As a consequence, she obtained a new passport and it is the charge in respect of false declaration concerning her earlier passport that was placed on the schedule referred to above. 
      
       
     6 The applicant is a single person who is now almost 30 years of age. She has had a good education. Since leaving school she has been in continuous but itinerant employment, because of her extensive travelling.  
      
       
     7 Although she has a minor criminal record, being a conviction for larceny in 1990, the judge did not, and correctly so in my view, take it into account in fixing her sentence. She claimed that whilst in a living in ""squat"" in Amsterdam, Holland, she was approached by a male person who lived in the same premises. He offered her $5,000 to bring the narcotics the subject of the principle charge back to Australia. She also said that she obtained possession of the drugs in Paris. 
      
       
     8 The applicant was represented by counsel at her sentence hearing. At that hearing she elected to give no evidence, as was her entitlement. However, this left the judge with a paucity of evidence in relation to the extent of the involvement of the applicant in the criminal enterprise in question. From the evidence before him he drew the inference that she was more than a mere courier. 
      
       
     9 It was incumbent on the applicant to prove, but only on the balance of probabilities, that she should be regarded as a courier, since such a degree of involvement in the criminal enterprise could be a factor to be taken into account in mitigation of penalty. That being merely a courier may be a matter in mitigation of sentence is clear from the decision of the High Court in Regina v Olbrick (199), in which Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. 
         
        
        
         
         Characterising the offender as a 'courier' or a 'principal' must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did. 
         
        
        
         
         There are, of course, cases in which only one offender is prosecuted but it is clear that the importation is part of a business venture that is organised hierarchically. In such a case a distinction between courier and principal might be useful to indicate where an offender fitted into the hierarchy of the organisation. And that, in turn might assist in identifying the nature of that offender's criminality. But there was no evidence, one way or the other, to suggest that this was such a case. There was nothing before the primary judge which revealed that the respondent was part of any business venture of that kind. All that was known was that the respondent asserted that he was to be paid $15,000 for importing the heroin. That is, the respondent asserted that the importation of such a large quantity of heroin was for his financial gain rather than for some other purpose such as his own use.  
         
        
        
         
         Whether others stood to gain from the respondent's conduct does not, it seems to us, affect what sentence should have been passed on him. That depended on what he had done and who he was, not on what others may have hoped to gain from his activity. But even if this were thought to be a useful inquiry, it was one that could not be pursued in this matter because there was no evidence about it.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        The judge accepted that the applicant: 
        
        
         
         “(a) was genuinely sorry for, and deeply ashamed of, her behaviour; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) was a person who would be unlikely to involve herself in like criminal activity again; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) pleaded guilty to the relevant charge at the earlier possible time, but; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) had a substance abuse problem which she was unwilling or unable to acknowledge and; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) had given minimal assistance to the authorities.” 
         
        
       
     10 In fixing the sentence the judge applied the principles set out in Pt 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. He correctly determined that a custodial sentence was appropriate to the criminality involved in the principle offence which he correctly characterised as ""one of the most serious offences under Commonwealth law."" Appropriately he had regard to the concept of general deterrence which is important in view of the seriousness of the offence, the difficulty in detecting its commission and the damage that narcotics such as MDMA do in our society. 
      
       
     11 In determining the role played by the applicant in connection with the importation, the judge noted that he had but little information and that the paucity of information was because the applicant herself had said very little, as was her right, about the operation which underlay the importation. She claimed she had been given the bag by an unnamed friend and she was to be paid $8,000 by another unnamed person to whom she was to hand the bag in which the drugs were secreted following her arrival in Sydney. 
      
       
     12 It was clear from the statement made by the applicant that her involvement was for the money. Faced with this situation, the judge concluded that the material before him did not tend to indicate that the applicant was one of the principals in the operation, but by the same token it did not allow him to determine anything more than that she was the importer. 
      
       
     13 At the sentence hearing, a schedule of sentences was produced from an examination of which the judge Kinchington concluded that head sentences ranging between seven and 10 years were appropriate when the quantity of the narcotic in question lay between 0.7 and 1.0 kilograms. 
      
       
     14 He then noted the applicant's entitlement to a discount on the sentence because of her early plea and the nominal assistance she gave to the authorities. However, he did not quantify the extent of the discount given on this account, nor did he, in fixing the head sentence or in determining the period of non-parole, advert to the prospects of rehabilitation revealed in the evidence before him. 
      
       
     15 There were three reports that were material to the question of the rehabilitation of the applicant. One was from a psychologist, Ms Barrier. The judge adverted to this report in his remarks on sentence, but only to that part of it which recommended that the applicant should undergo counselling for her drug use and in relation to her poor self image. He did not refer to that part of the psychologist's report which dealt with the desire of the applicant, ""to undertake... drug education and counselling."" Furthermore, nowhere in his remarks on sentence does the judge refer to the assessment by Major Connie Hindle, Court and Prison Chaplain, which supports, ""a time of rehabilitation (as) a part of (her) sentence,"" for which Major Hindle clearly thought the applicant to be an appropriate subject. Nor did the judge advert to the assessment by Ron Brown, Prison Assessment Officer, who, ""assessed (the applicant) as suitable for the Salvation Army Bridge Programme in relation to (her) drug problem."" Mr Brown formed the view, as did the counsellor with whom the applicant had been working at Mulawa Correctional Centre, that the applicant had, ""the necessary motivation to undertake this programme and find benefit in it.” 
      
       
     16 The fact that the judge did not advert to any of this evidence is, in my opinion, a significant oversight which is material to the fixing to the head sentence and, even more particularly, to the determination of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     17 In my opinion the foregoing was a relevant error in the sentencing process. That being so, it is open to this Court to review both the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
      
       
     18 The offence committed by the applicant was serious; one of the more serious offences in the realm of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, the amount of the drug involved was substantial and the means taken to avoid detection were quite sophisticated. The applicant engaged in the criminal enterprise for money, but in her favour are the findings as to her contrition, her plea of guilty, her shame and the unlikelihood that she would involve herself in like criminal activity again. 
      
       
     19 Furthermore, in assessing both the head sentence and the non-parole period, regard must be had to the prospects of rehabilitation of the applicant which, on the evidence before the court, would appear to be reasonably good. 
      
       
     20 When these factors are combined with the plea of guilty for which the applicant should, in my opinion, receive a discount on sentence in the order of 20 percent, I am of the opinion that an appropriate head sentence would be six years and that, subject to an appropriate condition as to the attendance of the applicant at an approved, full-time residential drug rehabilitation programme, it would be appropriate to fix the non-parole period at three and a quarter years. The condition which should attach to such parole should be that the applicant be required to attend and complete an approved full-time residential drug rehabilitation programme and that in the event she fails to attend, or to continue in the programme, her parole be revoked. In the light of the foregoing, I would propose orders as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
        
        
       2. Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       3. Sentence quashed and in lieu thereof there be substituted a term of imprisonment for six years expiring on 27 July 2007 with a non-parole period of three and a quarter years so the applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 27 October 2004, such parole to be subject to a condition that the applicant attend and complete a full-time drug rehabilitation programme to commence on the day on which she is admitted to parole and that in the event that she fails so to do, her parole be revoked. 
        
       
     21 GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders as proposed by his Honour and with the reasons he has given. 
      
       
     22 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     23 O'KEEFE J: The court has taken a view that it should give to you an opportunity to better yourself. Your sentence has been reduced by a year and your non-parole period by one and a quarter years. That is a very substantial reduction. It involves this court reposing a considerable amount of confidence or trust in you. 
      
       
     24 The life that you will live is yours. If you wish to destroy it, it is yours to destroy. If you wish to make something of your life, this is an opportunity to do so. 
      
       
     25 Please, in your own interests, make use of what has been offered to you. Dig yourself out of the hole into which you seem to have jumped with full vigor. 
      
       
     26 What happens to you between now and the time of parole, will determine whether or not you are granted parole at the earliest available date. If you engage in inappropriate activities in prison, you will not be released on parole on the first available date. But if you remain at a good prisoner - and if I could suggest undertake such programmes of drug rehabilitation, alcohol rehabilitation (which does not seem to be a problem for you but they go hand in hand), and in relation to your self image - it will mean that if you then enter upon the drug rehabilitation programme, your prospects of success will be so much the greater. It is in your hands. 
      
       
     27 The orders of the court will be as proposed above.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Spigelman CJ: I agree with Barr J 
      
       
     2 Barr J: The appellants, Brendan James Piggott, John Henry Griffiths and Michael Simeon appeal against their convictions in the District Court, each for the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methcathinone. Mr Piggott and Mr Simeon appeal also against their convictions for supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the same drug. All the appellants also seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  
      
       
     3 During the early part of 1999 Mr Griffiths, operating under the business name “ Solvent Solutions”, purchased chemicals and laboratory glassware from wholesale suppliers. Mr Simeon took a lease of premises, referred to at the trial as a factory unit, at Castle Hill. 
      
       
     4 On 28 and 29 June and again on 1 July 1999 the three accused visited the business premises of wholesale chemical suppliers. They travelled between the premises of those suppliers and the factory unit at Castle Hill in a motor vehicle owned by Mr Pigott. 
      
       
     5 On 29 June 1999 the police, accompanied by Mr Murtagh, a forensic analytical chemist, entered the factory unit pursuant to a search warrant. They made observations and took photographs. They took away for examination samples of materials they found there. 
      
       
     6 They visited the premises again on the following day. 
      
       
     7 On 1 July 1999, a video/audio recording was made of the activities of all three accused in the factory unit. They were the only occupants at any relevant time. The recording was continued on the following day, when only Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon were present. Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon were arrested when they emerged from the factory shortly after 9pm on 2 July 1999. Immediately preceding their arrest Mr Piggott had driven his motor vehicle out of the factory premises. He was seated in it whilst Mr Simeon was in the act of closing the roller door. On the front passenger’s side of the vehicle, a police officer found plastic bags containing a further seven smaller plastic bags, each containing powder.  
      
       
     8 It was the Crown case that the seven bags contained 979.1 grams of methcathinone. Each appellant was charged with having been knowingly concerned in its manufacture. In addition, Mr Piggott and Mr Simeon were charged with its supply, constituted by their possession of it for the purpose of supply. 
      
       
     9 On 3 July 1999 the police and Mr Murtagh searched the factory unit and its contents more thoroughly. They found a variety of chemicals and a large number of items of chemical glassware and other apparatus. From this and from the video evidence it appeared that all three accused on 1 July, and Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon on 2 July were engaged in the chemical process which resulted in the manufacture, within the meaning of that term as it is used in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, of the contents of the plastic bags. 
      
       
     10 There was also present in the factory a quantity of powder, traces of which were detected on apparatus or utensils. Video evidence indicated that a small quantity of powder, estimated by Mr Murtagh at not more than about 20 grams or so, was added by the accused to other substances, and that the whole of the resulting mixture underwent the process of washing in acetone, designed to remove impurities from it. 
      
       
     11 In washing the impurities from the substance all three accused on 1 July and Mr Pigott and Mr Simeon on 2 July were engaged in purifying it and hence were knowingly taking part in a step in the process of its manufacture. 
      
       
     12 Apart from the 20 grams to which I have referred, the 979.1 grams was not otherwise manufactured at the factory unit. The evidence did not disclose where it was manufactured in any sense other than by purification. 
      
       
     13 At the factory unit the police officers and Mr Murtagh found documents in which were recorded two versions of the same chemical recipe. Documents in essentially the same form were found in Mr Pigott’s motor car following his arrest on 2 July and a further similar version was found in Mr Simeon’s house on 3 July. These were all typewritten documents and took two forms. The first was a recipe with nineteen numbered steps, indicating a process by which some sort of chemical reaction, up to and including purification by washing in acetone, might be achieved.  
      
       
     14 The second version was to the same effect, without typewritten numbered paragraphs but in which the quantities of the substances to be used were recorded in half-measures. 
      
       
     15 In Mr Griffiths’ premises was found a published chemical abstract from a Russian source for the synthesis of methcathinone. Both versions of the recipe were substantially based upon and were derived from that abstract. 
      
       
     16 In due course the trial judge expressed himself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the typewritten documents were substantially chemical recipes for the manufacture of a prohibited drug, which was likely to be methcathinone to the knowledge of each of the accused.17 The major issue at the trial was whether the powder in the bags contained methcathinone. The first and principal ground of appeal of each appellant asserts that the verdict (or verdicts) is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Each appellant says that the quality of the evidence was such that the jury were bound to have a reasonable doubt about that ultimate fact. Accordingly, the appellants must satisfy the Court that on all the evidence it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the bags contained methcathinone and return verdicts of guilty: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.18 There were several pieces of evidence consistent with the conclusion that the bags contained methcathinone but which could not individually or collectively prove beyond reasonable doubt that they did. Examples were the recipes, the chemical abstract and the results of test done by Mr Murtagh on substances removed from the premises and showing, if accepted, the presence of methcathinone. The Crown accepted and the jury were directed that the Crown could prove the charges only by satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the reliability of the chemical analysis of the contents of the bags. Two chemical analysts, Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, gave evidence for the Crown and one, Dr Kibby, for the defence. Only Mr Ballard analysed the contents of the bags, so his evidence was critical to the proof of the Crown case. 
      
       
     19 The evidence established that there are three tests by which the chemical analysis of an unknown substance might be determined. The first is a double test called Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), the second is called Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and the third Infra-red Spectrography (IR). 
      
       
     20 In GCMS the substance it is desired to identify is dissolved and the solution is introduced into an instrument which incorporates a column whose interior surfaces are coated with material that causes different substances to move at different speeds. The solvent moves very fast and becomes separated from the other components of the solution. As each other component passes out of the instrument a computer records a peak on a graph. The size of the peak is proportionate to the amount of the substance present. An electronic detector records the time that elapses between the introduction of the solution into the instrument and the passage of the dissolved substance out of the instrument. That elapsed time is called the Retention Time. The instrument prints out what is called the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC), showing, by printing peaks on a graph, which materials have passed through the machine and their retention times.  
      
       
     21 The second function of the apparatus is called Mass Spectrometry (MS). In it the emerging substance is electronically bombarded and converted into electrically charged particles, or ions. The test results are displayed by a computer-produced series of vertical lines or peaks on a graph, showing which ions are present and in what quantities. The position on a scale of each line or peak corresponds with the molecular weight of the ion detected and its height with the relative intensity or quantity of the ion. So the testing of a given substance should produce a typical pattern. The tester can measure from the graph and calculate the intensity of other ions detected relative to the major ion, expressing the result as a percentage figure. This is called the relative ion intensity. The tester can also instruct the computer itself to make this calculation. For this purpose the tester is concerned only with the four ions next in intensity to the major ion. 
      
       
     22 In TLC the unknown substance is dissolved in a mixture of solvents designed to separate its component parts. A small quantity of solution is placed on a line at the base of a rectangular plate. The plate is treated or processed so that component substances move up the plate in the solution to new positions according to their chemical composition. The distance so moved is called the Rf value. A number of dissolved substances can be dealt with in the one test on the one plate, including solutions of substances whose chemical compositions and Rf values are known. The solvent evaporates and “spots” of the unknown and known substances are left on the plate. The positions of the spots are plotted, apparently by line of sight rather than by the instrument itself, and Rf values assigned. In this way unknown substances may be demonstrated to be identical or not identical to (as having or not having the same Rf value as) known substances. 
      
       
     23 In IR the unknown substance, which will absorb infra-red radiation, is dissolved in a solvent which will not. An instrument scans the solution and measures the rate at which radiation is absorbed. It produces its results by printing out a spectrum, which may be compared with the spectra of known substances.  
      
       
     24 Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, both chemists employed by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL), and Dr Kibby, an analytical chemist of considerable experience, agreed generally that the most reliable of the three tests was GCMS. They did not agree about the value of TLC and IR. Dr Kibby, for example, thought that TLC results were of little worth. What can be said with confidence is that TLC and IR results were treated at the trial as being capable of supporting conclusions reached by GCMS testing but not, standing alone, of proving beyond reasonable doubt the nature of the powder in the bags.  
      
       
     25 Conclusions based on the results of GCMS testing require a comparison between the result patterns of unknown substances and those of known substances. An analyst may obtain the relevant patterns of known substances in any of three ways. Ideally, the known substance will be available to the analyst for testing on the same apparatus at the same time as the unknown substance. This is called a curator’s standard. Secondly, the apparatus to be used may already have tested the known substance. The results retained in the database are called the library standard. None of the tests carried out used library standards. When a laboratory does not have a sample of a known substance for comparison the analyst has to resort to comparing the test results with results published in scientific publications. These are referred to as literature standards. The three experts said that matches with curator’s standards were preferable to literature references which, of course, require the application of human judgment and are therefore subject to human error. Even so, the AGAL manual provides that literature standards are an acceptable source for comparison. 
      
       
     26 Methcathinone has been a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act only since December 1996 and the Court was told that this trial was the first in New South Wales concerned with that drug. Although both Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard had had substantial experience as analytical chemists – Mr Murtagh had been over thirty years with AGAL and Mr Ballard had eleven years’ experience as an analytical chemist including three and a half years at AGAL – neither had analysed methcathinone before.  
      
       
     27 When Mr Murtagh began to test the substances taken from the factory unit AGAL had no curator’s standard for methcathinone. Using TLC, which he conceded as the crudest of the tests, and GCMS, Mr Murtagh concluded by visual comparison with literature standards that a number of samples contained methcathinone. He told Mr Ballard his opinion. It is unnecessary to deal here with the attacks made at trial on the reliability of these conclusions. What is important about them is that from then on Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard, who not long afterwards became associated with the testing, thought or expected that the bags might contain methcathinone.  
      
       
     28 Seven samples, one from each bag, were taken by AGAL and numbered 991685 to 991691. They went to Mr Ballard for testing. On 12 July 1999 he did an IR test on them all and concluded by reference to literature standards that each was methcathinone. He conceded at the trial that further testing was necessary to confirm that conclusion. On the same day Mr Ballard carried out TLC tests on the seven samples and came to the same conclusion. However, he did not regard those results as settling the identification of methcathinone.  
      
       
     29 It was agreed between the experts that there were three factors important to the validity of an identification by GCMS, namely the retention time, the characteristic pattern of ions and the relative intensity of ions.  
      
       
     30 AGAL maintained a manual, an extract of which put into evidence as Exhibit WW. The extract comprises pages 12 and 13 of a 29-page document and the body of it is as follows - 
      
       
        
         
         7.0 GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY 
         
        
        
         
         Many of the above considerations concerning Gas Chromatography instrumentation are also applicable to GC-MS systems. 
         
        
        
         
         Autotune: 
          is an automated tuning program for general purpose MSD operation. It optimises MSD performance. In autotuning the mass number is calibrated, the mass peak resolution is adjusted as is the sensitivity or relative intensity. The data system automatically adjusts MSD parameters to meet certain predefined performance criteria. 
         
        
        
         
       Identification of Substances by GCMS 
        
       
     · Each analyst should be able to identify the MS of a substance by direct comparison to a reference spectrum and be able to determine any significant differences 
      
       
     · The MS should contain sufficient details (pattern of peaks and relative abundancies(sic)) to identify the substance by comparison to a reference spectrum. The reference spectrum should be obtained from one of (1) standard actually run on the same GCMS (2) library search reference data match (3) literature reference e.g. “Pharmaceutical Mass Spectra” The Pharmaceutical Press, London. 
      
       
     · Individual compound identification should be done by comparison with reference spectrum. Comparison may be done against the reference spectra manually or using the table of relative ion abundances. 
      
       
        
        
         
          
           
           Acceptance/rejection criteria for relative abundances of the five most significant masses: 
            
           ± 10% of the standard run on the same day on the same instrument, and or 
           
          
         
        
       
      ± 20% of reference spectra. 
      
       
     · If the MS contains several relatively abundant ions at the high mass end, comparison with the condensed library spectrum may be sufficient. For substance that contain only one or two relatively small sized ions an expanded scale spectrum should be printed and this compared with a slightly expanded spectrum run of the reference standard 
      
       
     · The retention time should be considered as certain high mass molecules may match an MS but would be unlikely to have a similar retention time to the unknown 
      
       
     · A satisfactory spectrum may be difficult to obtain for trace drug components. The spectrum may be highly indicative of a particular drug component but contain additional small peaks (instrumental background, contamination) not present in the reference spectrum. Do not eliminate a substance due to the presence of such small peaks. 
      
       
     · Condensed library spectra contain only the most significant peaks as selected by the instruments library creation algorithm. The proportion of minor peaks may vary from one analysis to another, instrument to instrument and may be affected by background and sample concentration. 
      
       
     31 On 15 July 1999 Mr Ballard carried out a GCMS test on sample 991685 and by a visual comparison with a literature standard concluded that the substance was methcathinone. He was cross-examined on the question whether the relative intensity of the ions came within the 20% tolerance provided for in the manual.  
      
       
     32 The literature standard was set out in a document which became Exhibit 158. Mr Ballard agreed that the 20% tolerance was to be calculated on the literature standard, not on the results of tests of the unknown substance. His test results were set out in a document Exhibit 157. Exhibit XX was a computer-produced calculation assigning intensities to the ions Mr Ballard’s test showed to be present. The most abundant ion in the tested and the literature samples was ion 58. The next four most abundant ions, not necessarily in decreasing order of size, were numbers 77, 51, 56 and 42. The value of 100% was assigned to ion 58 and lower percentage figures to the other ions according to their abundances relative to that of ion 58 as revealed in the test results.  
      
       
     33 Mr Ballard agreed in cross-examination that the following were the relevant intensities of ions 58, 77 and 51. In the literature standard ions 77 and 51 were present in about equal intensities and each was assigned a value relative to ion 58 of 11%. According to the manual, therefore, ions 77 and 51 of the tested unknown substance would meet the acceptance criterion if their intensity, expressed as a percentage of the intensity of ion 58, fell within the range 8.8% to 13.2%. Mr Ballard calculated the intensity of ion 77 from his results in Exhibit 157 at 23%. The computer-calculated intensity in Exhibit XX was 24.19%, exceeding the literature standard by 83%. Mr Ballard calculated the intensity of ion 51 from the results in Exhibit 157 at 28%. The computer-calculated intensity was 29.23%, exceeding the literature standard by more than 120%. There was this evidence - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. We have agreed, of course, that the only way the most intense peak in the spectrum is termed the base peak and all others are reported relative to its intensity. That is it, isn’t it? You can’t get around that, that is just not in the manual, is it, that is scientific precision? 
         
        
       
      A. That is the way of calculating the relative ion intensities, yes. 
      
       
        
        Q. Why calculate the relative ion intensities? 
        
         
         A. As I said, it is not often done. I can’t think of any occasion in the laboratory where myself or others I have worked with have actually done that. It is not procedure. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. These manuals and the NATA Service Charter aren’t all put out for mere fun, are they, is that what you are saying? 
          
         A. No, not at all. These manuals of which Exhibit WW is part are written according to the practices that we use. NATA then look at our practices, look at the manuals and their accreditation is based overall on that. But these manuals aren’t just strung up and blindly followed. These manuals are written up from what is being done. Exactly what the writer of this particular document meant by ‘comparison against the reference spectrum manually’ I can’t comment on but they would have written that with regard to what was actually done in the laboratory and what is actually done in the laboratory is a visual comparison. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Even for a substance that is unknown and not previously analysed? 
         
        
       A. I believe so, yes. 
        
        
         
         Q. Do forensic chemist have a certain magic that ordinary humans don’t? 
          
         A. I wouldn’t describe it as anything magic and, as I have previously said, there is nothing mystic about methcathinone. It is another substance like any other we analyse. We analyse it in the same manner as every other substance we receive in the laboratory. 
         
        
        
        Q. You see, WW ruins your confirmatory test, doesn’t it? 
        
         
         A. I don’t believe it ruins it, as I said these methods are dynamic. They are changed from time to time if something is found to be in need of change. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which is wrong if you accept that relative intensity of ions is not just proper but proven scientific procedure and I think we have all accepted that. Am I right? 
         
        
       
      A. I would say yes, it is proven procedure. 
      
       
        
       
     34 The references to NATA were to the National Association of Testing Authorities, an Australian body which accredits scientific institutions. 
      
       
     35 Mr Ballard said that when he tested sample 991685 he knew that the testing equipment could print out the relative ion intensities but that it was not the practice in the laboratory to do so. This question and answer followed - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Because if you had produced these results, 1685, which is Exhibit XX, there is no way, would you agree with me, that those results could stand up with what the manual says you are supposed to do, is that right? 
         
        
       
      A. According strictly to the manual, yes. 
      
       
     36 No comparison of retention times could be carried out at that stage because AGAL had no curator’s standard for methcathinone. 
      
       
     37 In view of the remarkable discrepancy between the relative ion intensities of the reference sample and the tested sample and the acceptance/rejection criterion of plus or minus 20% provided for in the manual the jury ought in my opinion to have regarded Mr Ballard’s conclusion as tentative at best.  
      
       
     38 Mr Ballard formed his conclusion by reference only to the second of the criteria, namely the appearance of the characteristic pattern of ions. Given that the relative intensity of ion 77 was almost twice as great as in the literature standard and that that for ion 51 was more that twice as great, I think that the jury ought to have wondered how firmly Mr Ballard could hold the view that the pattern appearance of the tested sample matched the literature standard. 
      
       
     39 The evidence about the AGAL manual, its status, intention and authorship, was unsatisfactory. Only two small parts of it were tendered. According to Mr Murtagh it was written by scientists for scientists to assist analysts, not to replace their skills. It was not to be read in a black and white fashion. He rejected what he called its dogmatic approach. Speaking of the tolerance margins for relative ion intensities, he made a number of statements which may not have sat well together, namely that the tolerance levels were valid, that the authors had given insufficient weight to the difference between two makes of testing instruments and that a test result falling outside the 20% margin should exclude a match technically, though it did not show that a conclusion to the contrary was wrong. He was not asked to explain what he meant by the word “technically”. 
      
       
     40 Dr Kibby said this of the manual -  
      
       
        
         
         It’s a part of the quality accreditation re laboratory. You must have adequate documentation of the procedures that you use for analytical chemistry, and these procedures and protocols are to be followed by all staff. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     41 Mr Murtagh and Mr Ballard routinely regarded the manual’s statements only as guidelines. Occasionally they ignored them. An example comes from the evidence of Mr Murtagh about testing samples on 13 and 14 October 1999, by which time AGAL had the curator’s standard for methcathinone. The manual provided for runs of blanks initially and between runs of the known and unknown substances, to ensure that the results were not contaminated by material remaining from any prior run. This extract is taken from his Honour’s summing-up - 
      
       
        
         
         …  
         and (Mr Murtagh) gave in evidence that, in relation to these tests, he had not done them in accordance with the manual – “technically”, again he said – in that he had not run a standard at the end of each blank, nor had he included duplicate runs as indicated by the manual. He claims, however, that the reference to “duplicates” relates to quantitation, not identity testing, even though the manual apparently indicates otherwise. He agreed that his runs in respect of these samples, however, was “technically” deficient, because they did not comply with the manual. 
         
        
        
         
         You have heard the evidence relating to the importance of complying with these set standards and counsel’s submissions to you in relation to that, particularly from Mr Mayne, whose evidence in cross-examination I am presently dealing with, but also from Mr Fliece and Mr Bonnici. You may ask yourselves whether substantial non-compliance with these set standards, designed to produce validity in the results of an analysis, can be properly regarded as merely technical. 
         
        
       
     42 Dr Kibby took the opposite approach and submissions by the appellant at trial and in this Court based on his evidence were to the effect that a test result falling outside the tolerance margin showed that the unknown substance must be a substance other than methcathinone. Such an approach seems unreasonable to me, if only because it makes no allowance for contamination or equipment malfunction and admits no possibility that an analyst may be unsure of the identity of a tested substance . 
      
       
     43 Dr Kibby also said this - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. How important is the criteria (sic) of relative ion intensities in relation to identification of a compound which is known against a compound which is unknown please? 
          
         A. Well, it’s critical. But remember the first criteria (sic) is retention time. It’s when the retention times match that you then have to progress to the ions observed and then the relative intensities of those ions. But if the retention times don’t match, you don’t even progress to the second and third criteria. 
         
        
       
       
      
       
     44 Dealing with the diametrically opposed views of the experts, the Crown put to the jury and repeated in this Court that notwithstanding the provisions of the manual the approach of Mr Ballard and Mr Murtagh was a principled one. Referring to Mr Ballard’s identification only by ion pattern, the analogy was drawn of a person recognising a common make of motor car. It could be legitimately done in either of two ways, it was submitted, namely by looking at it and assessing the make and model by reference to the way the make and model always appeared, or by recording the number of all the component parts and comparing them with the manufacturer’s list of parts. 
      
       
     45 In my opinion the analogy is of limited value. The recognition of a motor car as of a well-known model requires at least two things to happen. First, the observer has to have seen a substantial number of cars of that model in conditions which will impress all the distinctive aspects of its profile on the memory. Secondly, the car to be identified has to be seen in conditions which enable all the distinctive aspects of its profile to be seen. It is by no means clear that the shape or chemical profile of methcathinone was known to Mr Ballard, though he had read in the literature about the ion pattern that might be expected to be seen. He had never analysed methcathinone before, even though the process of analysis was the same as for any other chemical substance. He did not see all aspects of the shape of the test samples before reaching a conclusion, but only the shape represented by the ion pattern. As the cross-examination revealed, the shape that Mr Ballard saw must have differed to some degree from the literature description. 
      
       
     46 The analogy also assumes that the observer has no expectation about the make and model of motor car about to be seen, a condition that did not exist here.  
      
       
     47 AGAL received its curator’s sample of methcathinone on 5 August 1999. On 25 August Mr Ballard did a GCMS test of each of the seven samples. Unlike Mr Murtagh, he ran a sequence of tests in accordance with the manual, comprising one blank, three standard runs, one further blank run, a first and a duplicate run on the first sample (991685) and one run for each other sample followed by a further blank and a final standard run. 
      
       
     48 Mr Ballard prepared to run GCMS tests, as he said to establish that the substance was methcathinone. Before starting them he programmed the instrument and a summary of the intended test runs was printed out. It was tendered by counsel for Mr Griffiths and became Exhibit U. 
      
       
     49 Mr Ballard’s evidence was that he keyed in the name of the substance to be tested as “methcathinone” and that he probably keyed into the instrument a retention time of 9.8 minutes. He either keyed in or left in 0.2 minutes as the maximum permissible difference in retention time. On the summary Exhibit U the retention time of 9.8 minutes and the tolerance margin, called “window”, of 0.200 minutes appear. Next to each of the samples listed in Exhibit U appear under the heading “source”, the letters “ACQU”. They are an abbreviation of “Acquisition”, an instruction to the computer to acquire data from the samples being run 
      
       
     50 The instrument took about 29 minutes to perform each run.  
      
       
     51 The form of report for each individual run had provision for printing the date and time of commencement, the name of the component and the retention time, among other things. There was no provision for showing the tolerance margin or window. There was provision for printing the word “acquire” if the computer, according to its instructions, acquired its data from samples run. Each report also incorporated a graph with a computer-produced peak. If the peak fell within the window, the computer would print “methcathinone” at the apex of the peak, but would otherwise not print the name of any substance on the graph.  
      
       
     52 The results of the first three curator’s standard tests were printed. They became Exhibits V, W and X. On each report the retention time is printed as 9.78 minutes. It was common ground that the expected retention time for methcathinone was 9.8 minutes, but it was also agreed that a difference of 0.02 minutes was insignificant. Following the next blank run the unknown samples were tested and the results printed on documents that became Exhibits S to GG. 
      
       
     53 It was agreed that the retention time for each of the seven unknown samples should not differ from the retention time for the curator’s sample by more than 0.2 minutes. There was no direct evidence as to the manual’s requirements, in that respect. No relevant portion of the manual was tendered. However, the portion of Dr Kibby’s evidence extracted above implied that the manual mandated a tolerance margin of 0.2 minutes. 
      
       
     54 The first three runs, on the curator’s standard, produced identical results, including retention times of 9.78 minutes and the printed annotations “methcathinone” on the graph. According to the reports, the first run commenced at 12 hours 13 minutes 37 seconds, the second at 12 hours 42 minutes 37 seconds and the third at 14 hours 16 minutes 21 seconds, all on 24 August 1999. The reports of the first two runs, Exhibits V and W, bore the printed word “acquire”. That of the third run, Exhibit X, bore instead the word “file”.  
      
       
     55 The report on the test of the first of the unknown samples, Exhibit Z, showed the retention time at 9.55 minutes. Surprisingly, because that time was more than 0.2 minutes less than the standard retention time, the report printed “methcathinone” at the apex of the peak. Like Exhibit X, it bore the printed word “file”, not “acquire”. Mr Ballard was cross-examined about how such things could have happened. Then there emerged a fact which had not been mentioned (or perhaps noticed, for this is not intended to be any criticism of the Crown Prosecutor) during Mr Ballard’s evidence in chief, namely that the run was recorded as having commenced at 14 hours 17 minutes 52 seconds on 24 August 1999. That was impossible if the preceding run with the standard sample(report Exhibit X) did not begin until 14 hours 16 minutes 21 seconds and took about 29 minutes. 
      
       
     56 Curiously, Mr Ballard then said that he was conducting the tests not to confirm that the substance was methcathinone but only for the purpose of quantitation. He agreed in cross-examination that the notation “methcathinone” should not have appeared on the graph in view of the difference between the retention times. Later on, he confirmed that each run took about 29 minutes. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         A. Further looking at this last night, going through them with the times, it appears that I did use the instrument some time after 12.42 and before 14.16 – 2.16 – that day. 
         
        
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Between 12.42 – is that what you said? 
       
      A. Yes, 12.42 
      
       
        
        Q. And what time? 
       
      A. And 14.16, which is the next print-out. 
      
       
        
        BONNICI: 14.42 is the last. 
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. I’m sorry, when you say you used the instrument, you mean for something else?  
          
         A. Not for something else, but I believe I had some interaction with the instrument. 
         
        
        
         
       BONNICI: Q. Exhibit W is 12.42pm, is that right? 
       
      A. That’s right. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Why would you set a sequence up the way you did and you’ve got 0.2 window and you’re only there for quantitative purposes as you say, why would you touch that sequence at all, Mr Ballard. 
         
        
       
      A. Sequences are sometimes interrupted while they’re running. 
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Sometimes interrupted? 
       
      A. While they’re running. 
      
       
         
        
        … 
        
        
         
         BONNICI: Q. If you interacted with the machine there has to be a reason for that, doesn’t there? 
         
        
       
      A. Yes. 
      
       
        
        Q. What was your reason? 
        
         
         A. I can’t remember specifically, but I am guessing it’s to, well I am assuming I had seen that the computer wasn’t selecting the peak from exhibit Z onwards as methcathinone. Having already determined that it was methcathinone in those samples, and confirmed it by the previous tests, I believe I changed the window, opened the window a little to include it. 
         
        
       
     57 The summary of the sequence of tests, Exhibit U, was printed at 11 hours 11 minutes 37 seconds, before the first run began. It must have been intended and understood to be an accurate summary of the instructions then given to the instrument for the succeeding tests. As such it was misleading because it gave the impression that the tests that followed had been run subject to a limitation that a tested substance would be designated methcathinone only if the retention time fell within 0.2 minutes of 9.8 minutes. One would have expected an amended report in the form of Exhibit U to be printed, summarising the changed test conditions and listing the samples to be tested. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Here of course the very reason you stopped the sequence in the, if we want to call it the lunch hour, and started it again, was to enlarge the window to possibly .3, certainly over .23, isn’t that right? 
          
         A. At this point I can’t say whether that’s why I stopped the sequence. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Has anyone else, would anyone interact with the machine to increase the width of the window from .2 to over .23? 
         
        
       
      A. I don’t believe so. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. The fact is that the window on exhibit U showing .2 during the lunch hour had been increased to possibly .3, hasn’t it? 
         
        
       
      A. Possibly .3, yes. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Why isn’t that documented please, so we can know the exact window that we are supposed to be looking at? 
         
        
         
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Are you saying that it was increased and it possibly could have been .3? I am not sure I fully appreciate your evidence. You are saying the window was increased? 
       
      A. It was possibly increased. 
      
       
        
        BONNICI: Q. Not possibly, definitely increased, wasn’t it? 
        
         
         A. Again, I can’t specifically recall it, but it would appear that I possibly increased the minute. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let’s forget whether you recall it or not. It’s there documented in evidence that .23 is a difference in the retention times between the curator standard and the sample 1685 to 1691. It’s in black and white on exhibit U, isn’t it not, that the window is .2, and it’s also in black and white in exhibits Z to GG that methcathinone has been printed out on the pieces of paper that have come out, without even saying who did it, the window has been increased to over .23, hadn’t it? 
         
        
        A. It would appear so, yes. 
        
        
         
         Q. And when the window is increased, it’s increased from .2 to .3 you wouldn’t be doing .25? 
         
        
       
      A. I don’t know, I can’t answer that. Maybe .3. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. If anybody changed the window, it must have been you, is that correct? 
         
        
         
       A. Yes, I’d say that’s correct. 
        
        
        Q. So where’s the record of that change? 
        
         
         A. Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be a record. It perhaps would have been more prudent of me if I had changed it, then to reprint exhibit U showing that. I think it’s just -- 
         
        
        
        Q. More prudent? 
       
      A. It would have been a lot easier now to see that that was .3, 
      
       
        
         
         Q. So from what I gather you now know definitely in the lunch hour you must have done that on 24 August 1999, am I right? 
         
        
        A. Again, I can’t say that I definitely did it, but -- 
        
        
       Q. Could be there was a virus in the computer that did it? 
        
         
         A. I can’t answer that either, but it was quite possibly me who changed it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And if you did, the only possible reason you would have done it is to ensure that on the window it appeared as the word methcathinone, isn’t that right? 
          
         A. To ensure that the area was displayed in the relevant box, the area of the peak. 
         
        
        
        … 
        
        
         
         Q. Did you change exhibit U to show that or did you – why did you not tell anyone that you had done that please? 
         
        
       
      A. Why didn’t I change exhibit U? 
      
       
        
        Q. Mm hmm. 
        
         
         A. It wasn’t a purposeful thing. I guess, I already printed it out and I already printed out the sequence out in if I had changed the window, well, I guess it was an oversight. I forgot to reprint exhibit U which is the sequence. 
         
        
       
     58 Mr Ballard’s attention was drawn to the appearance of the word “file” on Exhibits X and Z, whereas the display on the other reports was “acquire”. There were these questions and answers - 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Please go to Exhibit U to make it simpler for all of us. Number 1 blank, number 2 the standard, number 3 the standard, that is the ones run before12.42 pm and all have the word ‘acquire’ don’t they? 
         
        
       
      A. Yes they do on that list. All of them have the word ‘acquire’. 
      
       
        
         
         Q. But if you look after 12.42 pm, exhibits X, and Z, the word ‘acquire’ is not there, it is the word ‘file? 
          
         A. Yes that is true and if I printed them all out every single one would have the word ‘file’. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you didn’t print them the following day, you printed them out between 12.42 pm and 2.17 pm on 24 August? 
         
        
         
       A. Yes I did, I thought I had made that clear. 
        
        
         
       HIS HONOUR: Q. You printed all of these out? 
        
         
         A. Exhibits X and Z I printed out, whether it was because the origins had been jammed in the printer or for some other reason I can’t now say but I reprinted those two. 
         
        
        
         
         BONNICI: Q. The only reason, Mr Ballard, is the difference, that there would be an extension of the window, there hasn’t been a paper jam, has there? 
         
        
       
      A. I can’t now recall. 
      
       
     59 There was no evidence of any paper jam. 
      
       
     60 It was put to Mr Ballard that the difference in retention time of 0.23 minutes indicated that the unknown samples did not contain methcathinone. He said that if his explanation were discounted that was a conclusion which was open. It seems to me that that was a very important concession which ought to have been given weight by the jury.  
      
       
     61 The evidence about the authority of the manual and the respect which analysts ought to have had to it was, in the circumstances I have summarised, ambiguous. The jury were not bound to accept at face value the evidence of Dr Kibby, and I have given one reason by way of example justifying a critical appraisal of it. There were others, too. Some of the results he described as “absolutely amazing”. He described the GCMS results of August 2000 as “…this rubbish proffered in evidence…”. He described test results as “dreadful” and obliquely accused the Crown experts of being biased. The jury were in the best position to assess his demeanour and these illustrations show why they might not have been inclined to place much weight on his evidence.  
      
       
     62 But even so, I do not think that the jury were entitled to treat the manual as of little or no authority and I think that they were obliged in assessing the evidence of Mr Ballard to regard as substantial the manner in which he disregarded its statements. They were obliged, I think, in view of the relative ion intensities that were ultimately shown to exist, to treat with caution Mr Ballard’s conclusion arrived at by visual comparison alone of the pattern on ions. The jury were also bound to regard what Mr Ballard described as his “interaction” with the testing apparatus, his putting forward a misleading summary of tests programmed as though they were carried out in terms and his not producing an accurate summary of tests actually done as throwing serious doubt on the integrity of his opinion based on those test results. 
      
       
     63 Evidence was adduced to try to explain why the differences in retention times should not invalidate Mr Ballard’s conclusions. The first was that the solvent mixtures used for the standard and the unknown samples were different. In my opinion the jury should have found the evidence unconvincing in view of the fact that no record was made of the nature of the solvents used. Evidence was adduced of tests run on methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine using two solvents in which retention times for pseudoephedrine differed by 0.4 minutes whereas those for methylamphetamine were substantially the same. However, no print-out of the mass spectrum of pseudoephedrine was produced and Dr Kibby disagreed that the peak referred to showed pseudoephedrine at all. In my opinion this evidence was unlikely to go any way towards removing the doubt thrown on Mr Ballard’s conclusions. 
      
       
     64 Evidence was also adduced of GCMS tests done after Mr Ballard’s certification. On 15 September 1999 sample 991691 was tested by Mr Murtagh and he concluded that the substance was methcathinone. However, the relative intensity of ions 77, 51 and 56 deviated by more than 20% from the standard relative intensity. On 18 August 2000 Mr Murtagh tested sample 991685. The relative intensity of ions was not significantly different from that in the test of 15 September 1999. The retention time was greater than 0.2 minutes from the standard 9.8 minutes and the shape of the computer-produced peak came under heavy criticism. The last test was done on 18 January 2001. All samples 991685 to 991691 were tested. The relative intensity of ions was not significantly different from that demonstrated in the two other tests and other criticisms were levelled at the results. In my opinion these results could go no way towards removing doubts about the conclusion contended for by the Crown.  
      
       
     65 When hearing an appeal under this ground the Court is to consider all the evidence. However, for reasons which I have explained it is not necessary to go outside the evidence of Mr Murtagh, Mr Ballard and Dr Kibby. In my opinion the jury, having considered the evidence of those witnesses and having given appropriate weight to such of it as might support Mr Ballard’s conclusion, I should have continued to have a reasonable doubt about the correctness of Mr Ballard’s opinion.  
      
       
     66 No complaint is made about the summing-up. The jury were appropriately instructed and their attention was drawn to the shortcomings of Mr Ballard’s evidence. I think that serious doubts ought to have existed in the minds of the jury about his identification by visual comparison alone on 15 July 1999 and in the tests of 24 August 1999. I am fortified in my view by these remarks of the trial judge on sentence - 
      
       
        
         
         In an interlocutory judgment, after the Crown case had closed, I expressed a view as to the value of Mr Ballard’s evidence, in light of the cross-examination of him, and, more particularly, in light of his having admitted “interacting” with the GCMS testing on 25 August 1999, when it had become apparent that the machine had produced a retention time inconsistent with his previously formed opinion. 
         
        
        
         
         I went so far as to say that if I had been the judge of fact, on that basis, and on the basis of other misgivings more particularly relating to relative ion intensities, I would have rejected Mr Ballard’s evidence and acquitted each of the accused, in respect of all charges, on that ground alone. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     67 I would uphold the first ground of appeal. It is unnecessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal filed by any of the appellants. I propose that in each appeal the appeal be upheld and the conviction quashed and that a verdict of acquittal be entered.  
      
       
     68 Bergin J: I agree with Barr J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: The appellant (who is also known as Victor Chan) was arrested on 29 November 1997. He was charged and stood trial in July and August 2000 on one charge, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         That between 1st October 1997 and 29th November 1997 he was knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports to which s.233B of the Customs Act applies, namely a quantity of heroin being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to heroin. 
         
        
       
     2 He pleaded not guilty, and after a trial lasting fifteen days was convicted by the jury on 11 August 2000.  
      
       
     3 On 6 October 2000, Shillington DCJ sentenced the applicant to twenty years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of fifteen years, both commencing from 18 August 2000. The appellant appeals to this Court against his conviction, and seeks to leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
     4 The appellant relies on the following grounds in his appeal against conviction: 
      
       
        
         
         1. There was a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge did not warn the jury that the evidence of the witness, Feng Wang, may be unreliable, and did not tell them why his evidence may be unreliable. 
          
          
         1A. There was a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge did not state what his ""good reasons"" were for not giving a warning under section 165 of the Evidence Act. 
          
          
         2. There was a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge did not tell the jury that the evidence of the witness, Feng Wang, should be scrutinised with great care, and must be accepted beyond reasonable doubt, before they conclude that they should find the appellant guilty 
          
          
         3. The evidence of Feng Wang concerning the activities of the appellant which involved dealing in drugs prior to the events constituting the res gestae of the offence charged should not have been admitted. 
          
          
         4. The trial judge misdirected himself on the admission of the evidence of the witness Feng Wang concerning the activities of the appellant that involved dealing in drugs prior to the events constituting the res gestae of the offence charged, as follows: 
          
         a) He applied the common law rules of admissibility, and did not apply the tests for the admissibility of such evidence which are set out in the Evidence Act. 
          
         b) He did not consider whether it was evidence covered by the “tendency rule"" set out in section 97 of the Evidence Act. 
          
         c) He did not apply the tests for admissibility set out in sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. 
          
         d) He did not consider whether there was any reasonable possibility that the evidence had been concocted before admitting the evidence. 
          
         e) He did not consider the question of whether there was any other reasonable or rational explanation for the evidence other than that the accused is guilty of the offence charged before admitting the evidence. 
          
         f) He wrongly held that Wang's evidence was corroborated. 
          
         g) He wrongly characterised the evidence as evidence in rebuttal of the assertion of innocent association between the appellant and the witness, in the circumstance where the accused had yet to give evidence and had not yet made that assertion. 
          
          
         5. The trial judge should not have told the jury, when referring to the evidence of the witness Feng Wang concerning the activities of the appellant prior to the events constituting the res gestae of the offence charged, (which he referred to as ""relationship evidence"") that the purpose of this evidence is to place in context the conduct of Wang in his dealings with the accused. To deal with a possible suggestion on behalf of the accused that the Crown case would be unlikely as a one-off situation. 
          
          
         6. The trial judge should have clearly directed the jury, using his authority as the judge, that they could not use the evidence of the witness Feng Wang concerning the activities of the appellant prior to the events constituting the res gestae of the offence charged (the ""relationship evidence"") as evidence that he had a tendency or a propensity to commit offences involving drug dealing, (or that he was the sort of person who would commit the offence with which he was charged) or that he had a tendency or a propensity to use Wang as an intermediary in such dealings, or as evidence proving that he was guilty of the offence charged, but he did not do so. 
          
          
         7. The evidence was incapable of establishing that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. 
          
          
         8.There was a miscarriage of justice because the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. 
          
          
         9. The trial judge's directions on the question of the element of the offence that the accused was knowingly concerned in the importation were in error. 
          
          
         10. The trial judge did not direct the jury, or did not direct them correctly, on the concept or meaning of Importation"". 
          
          
         11. There was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the fact that counsel appearing for the appellant at his trial did not request several important directions, or re-directions, as follows: 
          
         (i) [withdrawn] 
          
         (ii) That a warning that the evidence of the witness, Feng Wang, should be scrutinised with great care, and must be accepted beyond reasonable doubt, before they conclude that they should find the appellant guilty; 
          
         (iii) That the trial judge withdraw the direction that the purpose of the ""relationship evidence"" was to deal with a possible suggestion on behalf of the accused that the Crown case would be unlikely as a one-off situation, 
          
         (iv) That the trial judge direct the jury, using his authority as the judge, that they could not use the evidence of the witness Feng Wang concerning the activities of the appellant prior to the events constituting the res gestae of the offence charged (the ""relationship evidence"") as evidence that he had a tendency or a propensity to commit offences involving drug dealing, (or that he was the sort of person who would do that sort of thing) or that he had a tendency or a propensity to use Wang as an intermediary in such dealings, or as evidence proving that he was guilty of the offence charged, 
          
         (v) That trial judge re-direct the jury on the question of the element of the offence that the accused was knowingly concerned in the importation; 
          
         (vi) That the trial judge direct the jury on the concept or meaning of Importation"". 
         
        
       
     5 He relies on the following grounds in his application for leave to appeal against sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The applicant was sentenced on the basis of factual findings that were not open to the sentencing judge, which significantly increased the severity of the applicant's criminal activity, as follows: 
          
         (i) There was no evidence upon which the sentencing judge could find that the applicant was “the principal who organised the importation"" or that he was “the instigator of the importation""; 
          
         (ii) Nor was there any basis upon which the sentencing judge could find that “Wang was entrusted (by the applicant) to make contacts with Ah John, the organiser in Thailand,  
         for the transport of the heroin to Australia"". 
          
         (iii) Nor was there any basis to find that the applicant had instructed “Wang to use another operative, ""a boy"" to use his phrase, to receive the drugs at a city hotel in Sydney."" 
          
         (iv) The sentencing judge incorrectly stated that, “The Crown's case was, as I have said, that the prisoner was the organiser of the importation.” 
          
          
         2. The applicant was denied natural justice in the sentencing proceedings. 
          
          
         3. The sentencing judge should have had a reasonable doubt on the questions of whether the applicant was “the principal who organised the importation,” or that he was “the instigator of the importation"". 
          
          
         4. The sentencing judge did not take proper account of section 16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. 
          
          
         5. The sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that the applicant had no prior criminal history. 
          
          
         6. The sentence was manifestly too severe. 
          
          
         7. The sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that the applicant went into custody on 11 August 2000. 
         
        
        
       BACKGROUND 
       
     6 There was no dispute at the trial concerning the fact of importation of a commercial quantity of heroin, and no objection on appeal to that part of the summing up where the trial judge said to the jury that they might conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there was such an importation, and that the real issue was whether the appellant was knowingly concerned in it.  
      
       
     7 The importation shown by the evidence was of about 3.4 kilograms of heroin brought on a flight from Bangkok to Sydney, arriving on the morning of 27 November 1997, by one Nima Tsering Ghale. Ghale successfully cleared customs, and took accommodation at Hyde Park Plaza Hotel in College Street, Sydney. 
      
       
     8 On 28 November 1997, one Keshun Karki arrived in Sydney on a flight from Bangkok, and he booked into the Highfield Private Hotel at Kings Cross.  
      
       
     9 Police monitored a proposed handover of heroin, and rented a room at Camperdown Travelodge as the intended site of this handover. Inspector Raymond Lam of the National Crime Authority played an undercover role as the person representing the persons who were to receive the heroin. On 29 November 1997 he was sent by Karki to the Hyde Park Plaza, where a portion of the heroin was handed over to him. Shortly afterwards, Ghale was arrested at the Hyde Park Plaza Hotel with the balance of the heroin, and Karki was arrested at Camperdown Travelodge. Some hours later, the appellant was arrested at a restaurant in Marrickville.  
      
       
     10 The principal evidence implicating the appellant was given by Feng Wang, a registered informant with the National Crime Authority. He gave evidence to the following effect.  
      
       
     11 Wang came from China to Australia in 1988, aged 18 years. He came on a student visa to study English at a college in Sydney. After over-staying his visa, he ultimately was granted a four year temporary visa following the 1989 Tiannamen Square incident. He came to know the appellant Victor Chan as a result of attending a gambling house at Kings Cross during 1991 and 1992. He understood the appellant to be associated with a group of Chinese persons of Singaporean or Malaysian background known as the Singma. He knew the appellant as “Dai Lo” (Big Brother) and Wang himself was referred to by the appellant as “Xiao Dei (Little Brother). During this time, he also came to know a man referred to as Ah John, whom he saw in the company of the appellant.  
      
       
     12 In 1992, Wang was arrested by Police in Victoria and charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin. He pleaded guilty and offered to give assistance including assistance by way of evidence against the persons who had recruited him. He was sentenced in the County Court in Victoria to six years with a four year minimum term, it being indicated that but for his offer to give evidence against the principals, the applicable sentence would have been twelve years with eight years non-parole. Wang gave evidence in committal proceedings against both principals, following which one of them pleaded guilty. He was subsequently called to give evidence in the trial of the other principal.  
      
       
     13 During his imprisonment in Victoria, Wang applied for refugee status, and his application was rejected. He appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and lost his appeal in 1997. He then made an application to the Federal Court, and that application had not been decided at the time of the trial. He also made a request for intervention to the Minister for Immigration, which also had not been determined at the time of the trial. 
      
       
     14 Also while in prison, Wang saw an advertisement in a Melbourne Chinese newspaper whereby the National Crime Authority invited assistance and information regarding serious crime or drugs from members of the Chinese community. Wang wrote to the National Crime Authority offering assistance, and he was interviewed by Inspector Lam. Following his release from custody in Victoria, the balance of his parole was transferred to New South Wales, and in March 1997 he became a registered informant with the National Crime Authority. 
      
       
     15 Shortly after Wang’s release from prison, he was contacted by the appellant and asked to get in touch with him on his return to Sydney. Upon his return to Sydney, Wang attended a dinner with Victor Chan and a number of other persons. According to Wang, he was provided with $1,000.00 by the appellant at that dinner, and thereafter began an increasingly frequent association between Wang (then aged 27) and the appellant (then aged 45).  
      
       
     16 As a registered informant for the National Crime Authority, Wang was provided with a controller or minder, namely Inspector Lam, with whom he could converse in either Cantonese or English. He was provided with living expenses, a mobile phone and a toll-free phone facility, and he regularly reported his meetings and involvement with the appellant.  
      
       
     17 Over a period of months, the appellant began to entrust Wang with small tasks including the remission of funds through a bank to an overseas account, paying in cash of rental amounts which were due, and the collection of money from one person and conveying it to another. On one occasion, the appellant directed Wang to collect a small sample (referred to as a “photo”) of what was allegedly heroin and pass it to another person. On another occasion, Wang and his flatmate Peter Feng were asked by the appellant to do “a job”. Each was requested to get “a boy” so as to further distance themselves from the physical transaction, and arrangements were put in place for an alleged transfer of heroin from one Chinese group to another person identified as “Arthur”.  
      
       
     18 There was evidence given that during many of these activities, Wang was oversighted by the police to whom he was reporting; and some of the meetings between Wang and the appellant were the subject of tape recording and video observation. In the account which I will now give concerning the events the subject of the charge against the appellant, I will be referring to tape recorded evidence as well as Wang’s own evidence.  
      
       
     19 In October, the appellant informed Wang that he had called Ah John in Thailand about a supply of gear (heroin), and that he had not decided if he would take it. On 1 November 1997, the appellant advised Wang to find “a boy” and stand by for a job. In mid-November 1997, the appellant advised Wang to get ready to receive something in the next few days.  
      
       
     20 On 15 November 1997, Wang advised police that he had been given a new mobile telephone by the appellant and told to purchase a new SIM card for the purpose of the job. Wang did so and advised Chan of his new telephone number. He subsequently received a telephone call on that new number from Ah John who was in Thailand. Wang subsequently received many phone calls from Ah John, some of which were recorded by hand-held tape recorder at the time they were received.  
      
       
     21 At 11pm on 27 November 1997 (the day when Ghale arrived in Sydney carrying the heroin), Ah John telephoned Wang and said “My friend has already arrived, you tell Victor to give me a call tomorrow morning and to organise”. At 2am on 28 November 1997, Wang telephoned the appellant and advised “Ah John just called”, and the appellant replied “I know I have already called him … Stand by tomorrow to pick up the things after 12 o’clock”. At 1.50pm on that day, the appellant telephoned Wang and said “Stand by to pick things up at about 4 or 5 o’clock, others do not like to do it in day time it is better to do it at night”. Referring to his “boy”, Wang asked “If to pick up how much will you pay for the one who did the job?” and the appellant said “Give him to $4,000 to $5,000 a unit, it doesn’t matter, have to please others to do a job. Hide if first after getting it then wait for my instruction, give it to others”. Shortly after 5pm, Wang received a call from Ah John which was not taped, during which he was told “The horse is not good for gambling today we will gamble tomorrow”. At 5.25pm, Wang advised the appellant that the job would not take place until the following day. 
      
       
     22 On 29 November 1997 at 12.45am, the appellant telephoned Wang and said “Check in a hotel room they have to get in and get a scale, how much to check in a room, does it need several hundred dollars, would it be enough for $400 for two days. I have only got $300 … the one who do the job is he ready yet you don’t check in the room you tell him to go, after fixing it up contact me again at 11 o’clock tomorrow”. Following that communication, Wang met with the appellant and was provided with money. He rang the police in the early hours of that morning, and Inspector Lam and Detective McEwan travelled from their homes to the city and met with Wang. Arrangements were then made to rent a hotel room at the Camperdown Travelodge. Video and electronic surveillance was set up in the room, and it was decided that Inspector Lam would play the role of Wang’s “boy”. During the morning of 29 November 1997, Wang received a number of telephone calls from Ah John and he also spoke with the appellant. Together with Inspector Lam and Detective McEwan, he purchased a set of scales.  
      
       
     23 At about 10.46am on 29 November 1997, Wang met the appellant face to face. Wang was fitted with a recording device and the conversation was recorded. At the meeting, Wang told the appellant that he had bought the scales and rented a hotel room, and advised the appellant of the daily rate. The appellant told him “in a moment you get the phone number and address to me I give him a call”. He also said “Go there wait for him … I check with outside to see what time will arrive”. The appellant said “How about the scale?” and was told by the appellant “Oh put it inside”. The appellant also said “When [he] gets it we’ll simply show him how much on it and look clearly”. The appellant asked Wang for the phone number of the Travelodge and the room number. Wang asked the appellant “How much should I take?” The appellant said “Take two or three persons three units three units, hurry up can get more after it is done, two or three units doing like this”.  
      
       
     24 Later in the morning of 29 November, Ah John telephoned Wang, and Wang said “Did you talk to Victor?” and Ah John said “Couldn’t reach him on the phone”. Telephone records reveal numerous international calls being redirected to the appellant’s message bank. Ah John said that the person who would come to the room would be called “Peter” and that Wang’s “boy” should call himself “Jimmy”. Karki arrived at the Camperdown Travelodge calling himself “Peter”, and met with Inspector Lam, calling himself “Jimmy”, in the designated room. Karki directed Inspector Lam to go to the Hyde Park Plaza, where in due course he was directed to a room where Ghale was waiting with the heroin.  
      
       
     25 Following that changed plan, the appellant telephoned Wang and was advised by him of the change of plan. Wang said “Haven’t eaten yet … He mixed things up, he wanted me to go to another place for the meeting”. During that phone call, the appellant identified to Wang which of the two mobile phones he was then using that Wang should use to contact him. Evidence established that the appellant used a number of mobile phone numbers, none of which were registered in his name.  
      
       
     26 Ah John continued to phone Wang on a number of occasions to see how things were going. In a call at 5.18pm, Ah John said to Wang “Other side called our side get some money first how about $10,000 … you tell him to get a few more hours and see how it goes”. Wang said “Then I have to ask Victor later”. Ah John said “Oh Victor, I have spoken to Victor, did Victor talk to you I talked to him in the morning”. At that time, Ghale had already been arrested and Karki was about to be arrested.  
      
       
     27 The appellant gave evidence at the trial and sought to explain away many of the objective circumstances relied on by the Crown in the circumstantial case against him. Aspects of evidence such as the appellant’s direction to Wang to collect three units, the discussion about scales, contact between his telephones and Ah John, attempted contact between Ah John and himself, and Ah John’s conversations in which he indicated he had been speaking with “Victor” were either denied (the appellant said for example that the name spoken by Ah John on the tape was “Peter” not “Victor”), or explained as being about other matters, for example that the $300 was to rent a room for a wild sex party. 
      
       
        
       WARNING ABOUT WANG’S EVIDENCE (GROUNDS 1, 1A AND 2) 
       
     28 In his summing up, the trial judge said this about the witness Wang: 
      
       
        
         
         Members of the jury that is the evidence which you have to consider. The Crown has put submissions to you, I do not propose to go over those in detail. The Crown concedes, of course, that Wang is critical to the Crown's case. He does not suggest that - to use his phrase - that Wang is a paragon of virtue. He agrees that he was involved in serious criminal activity in Victoria involving the importation of heroin, for which he served a sentence. He was there, on Wang's account of course, as the person who transported things down to Melbourne, took charge of them in Melbourne. 
          
          
         He recognises also that Wang's refugee status certainly was, and is, undecided. That is a matter, no doubt, which and certainly Mr Strathdee has urged you to take into account as to the credibility and the weight that you would attach to his evidence.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         He said that you would regard Wang as a man of, what he described as, raw intelligence. I think he implied by that, intelligent, but also cunning. He emphasised that he was involved in this drug importation, very large drug importation to Victoria. He says he's an opportunistic person, his reasons for dealing with the NCA were basically to assist him to be able to stay in this country. He has pointed out that he has certainly told lies when he was first arrested in Victoria as to what he was involved in, suggesting that what he thought was in the boxes was gold. 
          
          
         He said he simply denied buying a mobile phone from Marco Polo. He suggested to you that you would accept the evidence of that witness, that in fact he did buy a phone from him, although it apparently was not the one which is before you as an exhibit, although you will remember that Mr Strathdee put to him quite firmly that that was the one held bought from Marco Polo. He said you would also recognise him as a liar by reason of his reference to the Shark Fin Restaurant dinner in which Wang said that it was the accused that paid for that dinner. 
          
          
         He also points out that Wang, apart from overstaying his visa, being in breach of the Commonwealth laws of immigration, was also involved on a number of occasions in the brothel business, and he said that is a matter which you would also look at, that you would regard his evidence as unreliable for those various reasons. He said that Wang had a motive to impress, in particular, Mr Lam at the NCA, when he first saw him, and that he had a continued motive to put a gloss on matters, in effect, which were favourable to himself and for that reason he is unreliable. 
         
        
       
     29 The trial judge did not give a direction that the evidence of Wang should be scrutinised with great care and must be accepted beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could find the appellant guilty; and did not give a warning of the kind referred to in s.165 of the Evidence Act, which is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         165(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
          
         (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,  
          
         (b) identification evidence,  
          
         (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,  
          
         (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,  
          
         (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,  
          
         (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,  
          
         (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person---evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.  
          
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
          
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
          
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
          
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
          
         (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.  
          
         (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.  
          
         (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     30 Mr. Patch for the appellant submitted that the Crown’s case depended upon Wang’s evidence being accepted beyond reasonable doubt; so a direction pointing this out and stressing the need to scrutinise Wang’s evidence with great care, was required: R v. Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12. 
      
       
     31 In any event, Mr. Patch submitted, a s.165 direction was required. Wang was a crucial witness, and his evidence was potentially unreliable for the following reasons. Wang had applied for a refugee visa, but that application had been refused. He had appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but that appeal had been refused. He had appealed to the Federal Court but that case has not yet been determined. A direct request to the Minister for Immigration to intervene was yet to be determined. Clearly, the Minister’s decision would be greatly influenced by advice from the National Crime Authority. Wang was very frightened of being deported to China, and it was likely that he would be deported to China, unless he performed to the satisfaction of the National Crime Authority. This in turn was affected by the degree to which he provided information and evidence to the National Crime Authority leading to successful prosecutions. He only contacted the National Crime Authority and became a registered informant after his application for permanent residency had been refused. For all those reasons, he had powerful reasons, based on self-interest, to tell untruths and to distort the truth. Furthermore, he had been involved with illegal prostitution. He was a person of bad character, having been convicted of being knowingly involved in the importation of a large amount of heroin (see R v. Lonie and Groom [1999] NSWCCA 319). He received a reduced sentence in return for providing information and giving evidence; and was therefore aware that providing assistance to authorities could be to his personal advantage. 
      
       
     32 Mr. Patch submitted that a s.165 warning had been requested, and accordingly such a warning was required. Although Wang did not fall within paragraph (d) or (e) of s.165, it was evidence of a kind that may be unreliable. A warning was necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of a miscarriage of justice: R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301, R v. Taranto [1999] NSWCCA 396; R v. Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362; Longman v. The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, Crofts v. The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427. It was insufficient for the trial judge to refer to submissions on behalf of the appellant. A warning with the authority of the judge was necessary: Domican v. The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 555, Clarke (1993) 71 ACrimR 58, BRS v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 331.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     33 In my opinion, this was not a case calling for a Murray direction. Wang’s evidence was important, but there was substantial circumstantial evidence in addition to Wang’s evidence pointing to the guilt of the appellant.  
      
       
     34 As regards s.165, Mr. Patch conceded that Wang’s evidence did not fall within any of the particular paragraphs. The question was whether it was otherwise “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”.  
      
       
     35 To a greater or lesser extent, all evidence may be unreliable, and it would be absurd to suggest that a s.165 direction is required in relation to all evidence which may, to some extent or other, be unreliable. In my opinion, what is required is to consider whether the evidence in question is evidence “of a kind” which the experience of the courts has shown may be more unreliable than the general run of evidence: cf R v. Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494, R v. Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 at 305.  
      
       
     36 Two particular “kinds” of evidence have been suggested as applicable to Wang’s evidence. 
      
       
     37 First, the evidence of persons of significant “bad character”. It is to be noted that s.165 does not specifically refer to evidence by a person with prior convictions or evidence by a person of bad character as being evidence of a kind which may be unreliable. This I think is to some extent because those categories could cover a very broad and variable range of cases, including many cases where a warning would be quite inappropriate. If it was attempted to narrow the range by use of some such word as “serious” in relation convictions, or “substantial” in relation to bad character, this would introduce a very subjective element into the identification of the “kind”. Furthermore, I do not think this is evidence of a kind where the courts have any particular experience not equally available to the community generally.  
      
       
     38 The other category suggested by the appellant is the category of persons with a personal interest to give evidence in a particular way, in particular, persons with a motive to ingratiate themselves with prosecution authorities such as the National Crime Authority. Again, no such category is expressly referred to, and again such a category would cover an enormous range of persons, in relation to many of whom a s.165 direction would be quite inappropriate and potentially misleading. Where, as in this case, the person in question is under close supervision of the relevant authorities, that person has a very strong motive not to be caught out in telling anything other than the truth, because that would be a devastating blow to his value to the NCA and to his chances of favourable treatment. The case is quite unlike that of an accomplice who has undertaken to give evidence against alleged co-offenders, who not only has a motive to exculpate himself or herself and inculpate others, and the knowledge required for effective invention, but also in some cases a liability to be re-sentenced if the evidence is not up to proof. 
      
       
     39 Taking all these matters into account, I am not satisfied that Wang’s evidence was “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable” within s.165. If, contrary to that view, it was such evidence, then the trial judge was in error at least in not giving reasons why a s.165 direction was not given. However, there were substantial reasons why, even if Wang’s evidence was of such a “kind”, a s.165 direction would have been inappropriate. Simply to say to the jury that Wang had a motive to give evidence in such a way as to ingratiate himself with the National Crime Authority would have been quite misleading. In order to prevent such a warning being misleading, it would have been necessary to qualify it at least by reference to the close supervision of Wang’s activities by the National Crime Authority, and to the detrimental effect of any detected falsity in his evidence on his relationship with the National Crime Authority. In my opinion, a decision to give no warning of the kind referred to in s.165 would be a reasonable decision, and I am satisfied that the absence of any such direction did not deprive the appellant of a reasonable possibility of acquittal.  
      
       
        
       RELATIONSHIP AND TENDENCY EVIDENCE (GROUNDS 3-6) 
       
     40 As noted earlier, there was evidence given by Wang of previous dealings with the appellant, including dealings involving samples of heroin. There was some corroboration of some of this evidence provided through the surveillance of Wang’s activities by the National Crime Authority. In his summing up, the trial judge said these things: 
      
       
        
         
         There has been in this case a considerable body of evidence which has been described as relationship evidence. That is evidence of events which occurred before the critical events that you have to consider. The critical events relating to the actual importation. The Crown has led evidence of earlier events involving the accused and Wang. The Crown suggests to establish what was the relationship between them. The Crown says this body of evidence establishes that Wang was a trusted offsider of the accused; among other instances that he was entrusted with large sums of cash money to carry out the accused's directions and on occasions to deal in amounts of drugs, that is in this case heroin, for the accused. The purpose of this evidence is to place in context the conduct of Wang in his dealings with the accused. To deal with a possible suggestion on behalf of the accused that the Crown's case would be unlikely as a one-off situation. To the extent that evidence was given by Wang of the accused's alleged involvement in other drug dealings, that is for example the Bondi incident, the sample of drugs Wang said he obtained in the cinema in Chinatown at the accused's direction. This type of evidence suggesting other criminal activity by the accused must only be used to place in context the full relationship between Wang and the accused in regard to the charge which you are considering. It is important on the Crown's submission that you do not simply look in an isolated way at the events involving the actual importation. But you look at what was the relationship between Wang and the accused. And I emphasise members of the jury it is only to establish what that relationship was that this evidence is relevant and it must only be used in that way. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         The Crown says this body of evidence demonstrates that Wang was regarded by the accused as a trusted and important offsider and one who could on behalf of the accused deal with various important drug dealings which were to take place in the future. 
         
        
       
     41 These grounds of appeal raise questions under ss.95, 97, 101 and 137 of the Evidence Act, which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         95(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.  
          
         (2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
          
         (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or  
          
         (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         (2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
          
         (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
          
         (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.  
          
         (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  
          
         (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.  
          
         (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         137. In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     42 Mr. Patch submitted that, although evidence of previous dealings involving heroin was purportedly led as relationship evidence, it did in fact amount to tendency evidence, suggesting that the appellant had a tendency to deal in heroin: R v. AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702. No notice had been given under s.97, and no consent to waive such notice had been given by the appellant (s.190), and there was no application by the Crown to dispense with notice. Accordingly, the evidence was not properly admitted: R v. AN (2000) 117 ACrimR 176.  
      
       
     43 Furthermore, the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have (s.101) (R v. Lock (1997) 91 ACrimR 356, Pfennig v. The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461, cf Harriman v. The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590. Even if s.101 did not apply, because the evidence was not tendency evidence, s.137 still applied and should have excluded the evidence: R v. Lissoff [1999] NSWCCA 364.  
      
       
     44 Mr. Patch submitted that the trial judge applied the wrong test. He said “circumstantial evidence which discloses other criminal activity is to be admitted only where the probative force of the evidence clearly transcends its merely prejudicial effect”, and went on “That, of course, is the substance of s.135 of the Evidence Act”. That was an error, not merely in misidentifying the most relevant section, but also in failing to take account of the fact that s.137 does not refer to “prejudicial effect” but to the “danger of unfair prejudice”. 
      
       
     45 Mr. Patch submitted that, even if the evidence was admissible, there were errors in the directions given to the jury concerning this evidence. It was wrong for the judge to say that the evidence was to rebut a possible suggestion, when no such suggestion had been made, as it had in Harriman. Furthermore, it was necessary to give a strong direction to the jury that they must not reason that, because the appellant had been involved in previous transactions with drugs, he had a tendency to engage in drug-related conduct and/or was likely to have done so in this case: Gipp v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106, BRS v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275, R v. MM (2000) 112 ACrimR 519, R v. Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, R v. Fraser NSWCCA 10/8/98, R v. AN (2000) 117 ACrimR 176. 
      
       
     46 Mr. Sutherland SC for the Crown submitted that the crucial question, as identified by Ms. Fullerton SC for the appellant in proceedings prior to the trial, was whether Wang was acting on his own behalf or at the instigation of the appellant. The nature of the relationship between Wang and the appellant was of crucial relevance to this question. The Crown case was that it was a relationship where the appellant was the “boss” and Wang was his “boy”, being given increasing trust, leading up to events the subject of the charge, including the entrusting to Wang of roles concerning the handling of drugs. The evidence was also relevant concerning the interpretation of words used in the taped telephone calls, such as “photo” for a sample of heroin. The events concerning the handling of drugs prior to the events the subject of the charge were under surveillance, including video surveillance, making them highly probative of the nature of the relationship: cf Harriman.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     47 In my opinion, the evidence in question was relevant otherwise than “to prove that [the appellant] had a tendency to act in a particular way” (s.97). It showed a relationship of a “boss” and a “boy” doing errands for the boss. To present the relationship as limited to entirely lawful matters would have distorted its nature. The fact that, in two instances, samples of heroin were involved was relevant to assist in understanding the nature of the relationship, and also in understanding what was happening in the video tapes of certain incidents. The material was relevant to language used in taped conversations, and also relevant to understand the conversations themselves, which were at times cryptic and allusive.  
      
       
     48 The material was plainly not admissible to prove a tendency to act in a particular way, if only because the notice requirements of s.97 were not satisfied. Furthermore, the trial judge did not address the requirements of s.101. However, since the evidence was admissible on another basis, the circumstance that it could have been misused did not make it inadmissible.  
      
       
     49 However, it was necessary to address its probative value, as compared with the risk of unfair prejudice, as required by s.137, and to a lesser extent, s.135. The finding of the trial judge was that “the probative force of the evidence clearly transcends its prejudicial effect”. That finding did not reflect the precise words of s.137, and in fact the trial judge then referred to s.135. However, in my opinion there should not be too much significance given to minor variations in language as between ss.101, 137 and 135. In particular, the circumstance that s.137 refers to “the danger of unfair prejudice” rather than “the prejudicial effect” of the evidence is not, in my view, a matter of significance. Essentially, what is to be compared in the case of all three sections, that is s.101, s.137 and s.135, is “probative value” and “prejudicial effect”. Where there is not a certainty of prejudicial effect, but only a danger of prejudicial effect, or a danger that there might be a prejudicial effect, then the weight attributed to prejudicial effect will be less. Further, prejudicial effect will generally be unfair, if it outweighs probative value. So I do not think the comparisons to be made in the three sections are comparisons between substantially different things in the different sections. Rather it is the result of the comparison and its legal effect which is different. For s.101, evidence affected by this section is not admissible unless its probative value “substantially outweighs” its prejudicial effect. In criminal cases, s.137 prohibits the admission of evidence if its probative value is “outweighed” by the prejudicial effect, expressed there as the danger of unfair prejudice. For s.135, there is a discretion to reject evidence if its probative value is “substantially outweighed” by its prejudicial effect, there expressed as the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial. In the present case, while the trial judge’s finding would not have been enough to satisfy the s.101 requirement, it is in my opinion clearly sufficient to satisfy the s.137 test, and to exclude a discretion to reject it under s.135.  
      
       
     50 Turning to the directions given, in my opinion, where s.95 applies to evidence admitted for one purpose, a jury should normally be told it must not be used for the prohibited purposed. One might therefore have expected in this case that there would have been an explicit direction to the effect that the jury should not reason that, because the appellant had been involved in transactions concerning samples of heroin, therefore he had a tendency to deal in heroin and/or it was probable he was involved in this importation of heroin. However, whether such a direction should be given in a particular case is a matter of judgment, and I am not satisfied that it was a material error disadvantageous to the appellant not to have done so in this case. In any event, no point was taken at the trial on this, so rule 4 leave would be required. I will consider this matter further when I come to consider ground 11 of the appeal.  
      
       
        
       ELEMENTS OF OFFENCE (GROUNDS 7-10) 
       
     51 Under s.233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act, an offence is committed by “any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation or bringing into Australia of any prohibited imports”. The trial judge gave these directions to the jury concerning the elements of the offence: 
      
       
        
         
         What is meant by knowingly concerned is it requires an answer to this question. Did the accused have something to do with, did he have a part in, was he implicated or involved knowingly in that importation. When I say knowingly he must have knowledge of the illegal activity which involved in this case the importation of these prohibited imports and he must himself do something to facilitate the enterprise. Mere knowledge of the enterprise is not enough, it is not sufficient for him to have known that there was this importation but he must himself have done something to facilitate the enterprise.  
          
          
         The Crown's case here is that the accused was the person who organised the importation which occurred on 27 November. That the physical handing over was to be coordinated by Wang acting on the accused's behalf. That Wang himself was instructed by the accused to use a boy to use that phrase which has been used a number of times during the trial to receive the drugs from the representative of the persons sending the drugs to Australia.  
         
        
       
     52 Later, there was the following exchange in the presence of the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, said, I think, that it is the Crown's case that the accused organised the importation. With respect it is the Crown's case that the accused organised-- 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I am sorry, not the importation-- 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: --the reception of-- 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: --the reception, yes, I am sorry. If I said, importation, that of course is incorrect. The Crown's case is, that he organised the reception of the importation. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     53 Mr. Patch submitted that at most, the evidence showed only that the appellant in October expected that there would be an importation of heroin, that initially he had not decided whether he would purchase it, that at some time he decided to purchase it (or some of it), and that he made arrangements to purchase it (or some of it) when it had arrived in Australia. There was no evidence that he knew when or by whom it was to be imported. The fact that the appellant may have agreed to purchase heroin after others, not known to him, brought it into the country, does not mean that he was knowingly concerned in its importation: see Trudgeon (1988) 39 ACrimR 252, R v. Tannous (1987) 10 NSWLR 303. In so far as the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal suggested to the contrary (to the effect that an importation was an ongoing venture, continuing after goods had been brought into Australia) in Lam (1990) 46 ACrimR 402, Courtney-Smith (No.2) (1990) 48 ACrimR 49 and Leff 86 (1996) ACrimR 212, those decisions are wrong, and contrary to High Court and Privy Council decisions to the effect that an importation is complete once goods have been brought into Australia: Lyons v. Smart (1908) 6 CLR 143, Wilson v. Chambers & Co. Pty. Limited (1925) 38 CLR 131, Election Importing Co. Pty. Limited v. Courtice (1949) 80 CLR 657, R v. Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203, Algoma Central Railway Co. v. The King [1903] AC 478, McGurk Construction & Rigging Co. Limited v. Comptroller General of Customs (1987) 73 ALR 381.  
      
       
     54 Mr. Patch submitted that, even if Lam were correct, there was no evidence capable of supporting conviction. In Lam, the appellant had facilitated the removal of capsules from the intestines of the importers, and it was held that this was a means of enabling the chosen method of importation to achieve the purpose of making heroin available in Australia. Here, the appellant had merely agreed to purchase heroin if and when it was imported. 
      
       
     55 Alternatively, Mr. Patch submitted that the conviction was unsafe, because of the inadequacy of the evidence to support it. Alternatively again, the directions were erroneous. It was pointed out by the Crown that the original direction, to the effect that the Crown case was that the appellant arranged the importation, was erroneous; and the correction was misleading, suggesting that the appellant had a role in completing the importation. There was no direction as to how organising the reception of the heroin could amount to being knowingly concerned in the importation; and there was no explanation of the meaning of “importation”.  
      
       
     56 Mr. Sutherland for the Crown submitted that it was sufficient that the appellant had made arrangements with those importing the heroin that he be the recipient of the imported material: R v. Kelly (1975) 24 FLR 441, R v. Shin Nan Yong (1975) 7 ALR 271.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     57 In my opinion, there was evidence to support the conclusion that, prior to the heroin leaving Thailand, the appellant had arranged with Ah John, who was involved in organising the movement of the heroin from Thailand to Australia, that he would take and purchase heroin that Ah John would cause to be brought to Australia. In my opinion, whether or not importation ends as soon as goods have arrived in Australia, the making of that arrangement would be sufficient for the appellant to be knowingly concerned in the importation. That is, a commitment in advance of importation made to the person arranging the importation of heroin to receive or purchase the imported heroin is, in my opinion, plainly being knowingly concerned in the importation. Accordingly, grounds 7 and 8 must fail.  
      
       
     58 As regards grounds 9 and 10, concerning alleged defects in the directions, I accept that it was an error to say that the Crown case was that the appellant had organised the importation, and I accept that it would not be sufficient in itself that the appellant organised the reception. There must be a further element that he did something which actually facilitated the importation itself. That was in fact put to the jury, although the directions did give rise to some possibility of confusion because of the other matters to which I have referred. 
      
       
     59 However, if Wang’s evidence was accepted in substance, the inference was inevitable that the appellant had arranged with Ah John, prior to the importation, that he would receive and purchase heroin when it was brought to Australia. The crucial question was whether Wang was accepted, and that was the issue on which the case was fought.  
      
       
     60 In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied there was a material misdirection, unfavourable to the appellant, on this point. 
      
       
        
       MISCARRIAGE (GROUND 11) 
       
     61 Mr. Patch submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice in the trial because of substantial failures by the appellant’s Counsel, in particular failures to seek directions when there could be no tactical advantage in doing so; and this meant inter alia that rule 4 leave should be granted where necessary in relation to the other grounds.  
      
       
     62 In my opinion, substantially for the reasons already given, there was no such failure, except possibly in relation to the relationship evidence to which I have referred earlier. I am not satisfied that there were not tactical considerations operating here. The seeking of an express direction that the jury should not use this material to suggest a tendency to act in a particular way, or to suggest that the appellant acted in a particular way in relation to the events the subject to the charge, could have been disadvantageous, where the substantial defence was, as it had to be, an attack on Wang. Although the evidence admitted as relationship evidence had some corroboration from surveillance material, just as the evidence in relation to the events the subject of the charge had some corroboration from surveillance material, including taped conversations, the knowing involvement in prior transactions concerning heroin depended entirely on Wang’s evidence, far more so than in the case of the events the subject to the charge. It could have been a significant tactical disadvantage to concede that the jury might accept Wang’s evidence on these matters, while still being unsure about his evidence concerning the events the subject of the charge. In my opinion, rule 4 leave should not be granted to rely on the grounds concerning directions about the relationship evidence.  
      
       
        
       SENTENCE APPEAL 
       
     63 Section 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth) is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         16G. If a federal sentence is to be served in a prison of a State or Territory where State or Territory sentences are not subject to remission or reduction, the court imposing the sentence must take that fact into account in determining the length of the sentence and must adjust the sentence accordingly.  
         
        
       
     64 The trial judge, in his remarks on sentence, said the following: 
      
       
        
         
         I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was the principal who organised the importation. He was careful to distance himself from the physical activities involved. Wang was entrusted to make contacts with Ah John, the organiser in Thailand, for the transport of the heroin to Australia. The prisoner sought to further insulate himself from involvement by instructing Wang to use another operative, ""a boy"" to use his phrase, to receive the drugs at a city hotel in Sydney.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         The Crown's case was, as I have said, that the prisoner was the organiser of the importation.  
          
          
         I am satisfied, as I have already said, beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was instigator (sic) of the importation, consistent with Wang's evidence which is referred to in the Crown's submissions at page 173 of the transcript. The fact that the smaller amount was handed over and that no money changed hands does no more than suggest that Wang was not privy to all the arrangements or that the suppliers themselves were not prepared to make these details known to the importers at that time. 
         
        
        
       He went on to say “I bear in mind that there are no remissions in this State and that matter is taken into account in accordance with s.16G of the Act”. He made no mention that the appellant had no prior criminal history.  
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     65 Mr. Patch submitted that there was error and denial of natural justice in so far as the trial judge sentenced the appellant as “the principal who organised the importation”.  
      
       
     66 Mr. Patch submitted that it was not enough for the trial judge that he took s.16G into account: he must in fact do so and adjust the sentence accordingly: El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370, Shore (1992) 66 ACrimR 37. It could be inferred that he did not do this, because that would have meant a starting point of thirty years imprisonment, which was plainly excessive.  
      
       
     67 Mr. Patch submitted that, although the absence of prior criminal history may have less weight in drug cases such as the present (Leroy [1984] 2 NSWLR 441), it still must be taken into account: Ryan v. The Queen (2001) 179 ALR 193. 
      
       
     68 Furthermore, he submitted, the sentence was manifestly too severe. The amount of drug involved was in the low range of a commercial quantity: R v Wong and Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. Furthermore, the non-parole period was manifestly excessive. The normal range was 60-66% (Bernier (1998) 102 ACrimR 44), and 75% was the extreme, reserved for the worst cases: R v. Drazkiewicz NSWCCA 23/11/93.  
      
       
     69 Finally, Mr. Patch submitted that the sentence should have commenced on 11 August, when the appellant was taken into custody; so at least that adjustment should be made.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     70 I accept that the trial judge’s statement that the appellant was “the principal who organised the importation”, if read literally and out of context, was erroneous. However, it was plainly open for the trial judge to find that the appellant was the principal at the Australian end of the transaction pursuant to which the drug was imported, and in my opinion that was what the trial judge meant by that assertion.  
      
       
     71 The trial judge’s statement that he took s.16G into account was in my opinion sufficient to indicate that he did make appropriate adjustment, at least unless there was some indication to the contrary. A starting point of thirty years imprisonment is not in my view such an indication. Having regard to the position of the appellant as the principal at the Australian end of the transaction pursuant to which the drug was imported, and as a person who sought to distance himself as far as possible from physical contact with the drugs, and having regard to the importance of general deterrence in such circumstances, such a starting point would not be inappropriate. Neither such starting point, nor the absence of express reference to a lack of prior convictions, leads me to the view that the lack of prior convictions was not taken into account. I do not think that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In so far as it may be relevant, Wong and Leung must now be read in the light of Wong v. The Queen (2001) 185 ALR 233. 
      
       
     72 In the circumstances of this case, namely that of a principal in a substantial drug importation, with no significant subjective considerations in his favour (apart from lack of prior criminal history), I do not think the selection of 75% for the non-parole period is indicative of error.  
      
       
     73 The Crown concedes an error in relation to the starting point of the sentence, but submits that it could have been corrected by the District Court under the slip rule. In my opinion, where there is no other error in relation to the sentence, this particular error can be corrected by this Court, without this Court needing to reconsider the sentence generally. If I were wrong in that view, I would refuse leave, and send the matter back to the District Court to adjust the minor error.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     74 Accordingly, for the reasons I have given, I propose the following orders: 
      
       
       1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, sentence and non-parole period to commence from 11 August 2000, appeal against sentence otherwise dismissed. 
        
       
     75 LEVINE J: I have read in draft the judgments of Hodgson JA and Smart AJ. I agree with Hodgson JA, for the reasons his Honour states, that the conviction appeal be dismissed. As to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, unlike Smart AJ, I do not consider the repetition of the words in the remarks on sentence relating to the role of the applicant to reflect an error in substance. I agree with Hodgson JA ( at [70]) as to context and thus with the orders he proposes as to the disposition of the application. 
      
       
     76 SMART AJ: The facts, circumstances and competing contentions of the parties are set out in the judgment of Hodgson JA. 
      
       
        
       Warning About Wang's evidence (Grounds 1, 1A and 2) 
       
     77 I agree with what Hodgson JA has written. The Crown Prosecutor in his closing speech made it clear that the Crown had never suggested that Wang was a paragon of virtue. The Crown detailed at length his faults his contraventions of the law and his efforts to gain the support of the authorities including that he broke the conditions of his student visa and became an illegal immigrant (or a prohibited non citizen), his lies to the police when first arrested for a drug offence, his subsequent admissions, his plea of guilty to a serious drug offence, his 50 per cent discount for assisting the authorities, his sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, his further assistance to the authorities and his early release from gaol, his recruitment by the authorities as an informer and his desire to stay in Australia, the position as to his attempts to stay in Australia and how precarious that was. 
      
       
     78 The Crown Prosecutor invited the jury to examine Wang's evidence closely. The Crown Prosecutor also dwelt at length on the explanations for Wang's conduct. The Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         ... in the opening when I implored you and invited you before you had seen him to bear these things in mind, to test and weigh his evidence, certainly didn't want to be accused of having presented [Wang] in some glossy light. 
         
        
       
     79 It is apparent from the final address of both counsel that the conduct, character and reliability of Wang was canvassed in much detail. In the end the Crown invited the jury to take the view that Wang had taken positive steps to redeem himself and that his evidence could be accepted, especially in view of the supporting evidence and the close police supervision. The appellant submitted that in view of Wang's unsavoury past and his need of future official NCA assistance to be allowed to stay in Australia, no reliance should be placed on his evidence. This was a spirited trial in which Wang and the appellant gave extensive evidence and were cross-examined at length and the issue as to Wang's reliability and credibility was fully ventilated. That was obvious to the jury and needed no further direction. 
      
       
     80 Any warning would have been otiose. I do not accept the proposition that, where the Crown accepts that a witness has had a discreditable past and evidence is led to that effect that he has turned his back on that past, a warning is required under s.165 as to his evidence. 
      
       
        
       Relationship and Tendency Evidence (Grounds 3-6) 
        
       Elements of Offence (Grounds 7-10) 
        
       Miscarriage (Ground 11) 
       
     81 I agree with what Hodgson JA has written on each of these matters. 
      
       
        
       Sentence Appeal 
       
     82 The judge was correctly impressed with the gravity of the offence involving 2.4 kilograms of pure heroin with a street value of about $4.85 million. Its wholesale value would be much less. 
      
       
     83 At p.2 of his remarks upon sentence the judge said that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the principal who organised the importation. That is the same mistake as the judge made in the summing-up where he said ""The Crown case here is that the accused was the person who organised the importation which occurred on 27 November."" The judge, on the application of the Crown Prosecutor, corrected that error in his summing-up by saying, ""If I said importation that of course is incorrect. The Crown's case is that he organised the reception of the importation."" In those circumstances I would not expect the error to be repeated twice in the remarks upon sentence. A little later in his remarks the judge said ""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was the instigator of the importation. ..."" 
      
       
     84 Based on the language used by the judge, it appears that he has sentenced the appellant on a basis not advanced by the Crown and not supported by the evidence. Error having occurred it is now necessary for the Court to reconsider the sentence imposed and whether any lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
      
       
     85 The evidence establishes that Ah John was the person in Thailand who organised the importation of he heroin into Australia and that the appellant was the person in Australia who organised the reception of the importation into Australia. The judge correctly found that the appellant  
      
       
        
         
         was careful to distance himself from the physical activities involved. Wang was entrusted to make contacts with Ah John, the organiser in Thailand, for the transport of the heroin to Australia. The prisoner sought to further insulate himself from involvement by instructing Wang to use another operative, 'a boy' to use his phrase, to receive the drugs at a city hotel in Sydney. For this purpose Wang employed Raymond Lam for this activity. 
         
        
        
       And later said: 
        
         
         ... the prisoner was a man of strong personality who used others to carry out his bidding. Without any apparent source of legitimate income he led a lavish lifestyle which included a substantial gambling activities. 
         
        
       
     86 The judge was correctly satisfied on the evidence that the subject importation was not an isolated activity. The judge declined to draw any inference favourable to the appellant from the fact that a smaller amount of the heroin was handed over at the hotel and the fact that no money changed hands at the hotel. 
      
       
     87 As to the appellant's subjective features, he was born on 15 September 1950, in China, and raised by his parents in Singapore. He claimed that he completed his schooling in Hong Kong and gained the equivalent of a Higher School Certificate. He is married with four children who, as at October 2000, were aged between 23 years and 11 years. His eldest son lives in Sydney and his younger children reside in Perth with their mother. His wife told the Probation and Parole officer that he was a good husband and a good father. 
      
       
     88 He reported to the officer that he had always worked, usually in his own business or business partnership. He claimed that at the time of the offence he had a business partnership in a market garden in Perth exporting vegetables to Asia, a partnership in a construction company in Kuala Lumpur as well as a business in Sydney exporting Australian wine to China. He admitted to enjoying gambling and frequenting casinos in Australia and overseas. 
      
       
     89 The appellant denied the offence, appeared disillusioned by the Court decision and obsessed with proving his innocence. The officer wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         ... Mr Chan's life has been centred around his business interests and while he expresses that his family in Perth are important to him and supportive of him it is the writer's opinion that business and gambling are his main pursuits. 
         
        
       
     90 The appellant complained that the judge had failed to take into account that he had no previous convictions. That fact appears from the pre-sentence report to which the judge has had regard. 
      
       
     91 The appellant complained that the judge had not made the adjustment required by s.16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. The judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         I bear in mind that there are no remissions in this State and that matter is taken into account in accordance with s.16G of the Act. 
         
        
       
     92 While many judges indicate a starting point and expose the deduction being made, normally about one third, there is no obligation to do so. Although not expressly stated by the judge, it is implicit in what the judge said that he was adjusting the sentence as required by s.16G. 
      
       
     93 The evidence revealed an offence of great gravity. The conclusion that the appellant was a principal in Australia for the reception of the importation is irresistible. He endeavoured to have others face the risk of being caught and gaoled, albeit that he was the mastermind. A starting point of less than 30 years would be erroneous. Applying s.16G of the Act, the sentence would become one of 20 years. Accepting the gravity of the offence and the applicant's heavy involvement in it, that the quantity of heroin was substantial (over 2 kilograms of heroin) but not at the top of the range, and bearing in mind that the applicant's culpability was slightly less than that attributed to him by the judge and his lack of prior convictions, there was no sufficient reason to depart from the usual range of 60 per cent to 66? for the non-parole period. The non-parole period should be towards the top of that range: see Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. The correct non-parole period is 13 years 6 months. 
      
       
     94 As to the commencement date of the sentence the judge selected 18 August 2000 whereas the date should have been not later than 11 August 2000, the date on which he was convicted and placed in permanent custody. However, the applicant was in custody on this matter from 29 November 1997 until 15 January 1998, a period of 46 days. There is no sufficient reason why the applicant should not have the benefit of that pre-sentence custody. That is not contrary to the Crimes Act (Cth). 
      
       
     95 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
       1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
       3. Appeal allowed in part. 
        
       4. Dismiss the appeal against the sentence of imprisonment of 20 years. 
        
       5. Non-parole period of 15 years quashed. In lieu thereof fix the non-parole period at 13 years 6 months. 
        
       6. Vary the commencement date of the sentence of imprisonment of 20 years and the non-parole period of 13 years 6 months to 27 June 2000 with the non-parole period ending on 2 December 2013 on which day the appellant will be eligible for release on parole.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: This is an appeal from convictions on four counts of homosexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 10 and 18 at Gosford District Court on 5 April, 2000. The appellant appeared at Gosford District Court on 3 April, 2000 and was indicted on six counts of homosexual intercourse with the complainant who was aged 14 and 15 during the relevant periods contrary to section 78K of the Crimes Act. The first count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 1 October, 1997 and 31 December, 1997. The second count alleged an act of oral intercourse between 25 December, 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The third count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 25 December 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The fourth count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 25 December, 1997 and 31 March, 1998. The fifth count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 1 May, 1998 and 1 July, 1998. The sixth count alleged an act of oral intercourse between 1 August, 1998 and 31 August, 1998. The complainant was born on 2 February, 1983 and the appellant was in his late twenties. 
      
       
     2 At the relevant period the complainant was living with his mother at Wyong. The complainant’s parents had separated in August, 1994 and the complainant’s mother formed a relationship with the appellant in 1997 and lived in a de facto relationship from then at least until the time of trial. 
      
       
     3 At the trial the appellant was convicted of the first, third, fifth and sixth counts and acquitted on the second and fourth counts. 
      
       
     4 On the first count, the evidence supporting the prosecution case came firstly from the complainant who said that prior to Christmas 1997 he was living in the house occupied by his mother and the appellant. He had his own bedroom which contained a trundle bed. He said the appellant came into his room and asked him if he wished to have sex and he then described an episode which led to the appellant removing his pants and lying on his stomach on the trundle bed and then allowing the complainant to have anal sex with him. In a record of interview with the police on 9 November, 1998, the appellant admitted that he had anal sexual intercourse with the complainant on four occasions, one of those occasions being in the complainant’s bedroom. He said that before Christmas 1997 he and the complainant were a bit drunk and the complainant gave methadone, which the complainant had stolen from his mother, to the appellant. The other evidence supporting this count came from a tape recording of a conversation between the appellant, the complainant and the complainant’s mother which was brought into existence apparently by the appellant and the complainant’s mother about six months after the record of interview. There was a dispute as to whether or not the complainant knew this tape was being made. It was tendered by the defence and part of the conversation on the tape was the appellant saying “It was only the four times it happened. It was once in your bedroom, that was the first time” and the complainant is recorded as saying “Yeah”.  
      
       
     5 The defence to the first count was evidence given by the appellant at his trial that he was anally penetrated by the complainant on four occasions, three of which were without his knowledge. On those three occasions he said he woke up either in his bed or in the lounge room feeling that his “backside was sore”. The appellant said that prior to these occasions the complainant had put methadone in his drink and this had knocked him out and made him go to sleep. He denied that to his knowledge anything of a sexual nature had occurred between him and the complainant in the trundle bed in the bedroom. He asserted the complainant had asked him to lie about the incidents because he did not want his father to find out what the complainant was doing. He said he agreed to do this and his assertion was the misrepresentation he agreed to was that he had consented to the acts of the complainant, whereas in reality the complainant had committed the acts without consent. When he was cross-examined about the taped conversation which he had been partly responsible for bringing into existence, and it was pointed out to him that the conversation indicated he was aware of what the complainant was doing to him, and there was no mention of his being drugged and asleep, the appellant’s answer was “I’ve just forgotten to say it, that’s all.”6 7 This count in the indictment did not rely on the evidence of the complainant alone and a warning about such evidence was not required. An independent assessment of the evidence given indicates a jury could properly be satisfied of the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against the conviction on the first count. 
      
       
     8 The appeal in respect of count three has been abandoned and is therefore dismissed. In respect of count five, the appeal has also been abandoned and is therefore dismissed.  
      
       
     9 The evidence in support of the sixth charge comes from the evidence of the complainant who in evidence when asked when was the last time something of a sexual nature happened, said “That was out in my lounge room of my house and that was on the lounge of the house and it was when he asked me if I wanted a head job and I said ‘No I don’t’ … I said ‘No’ about two or three times but then he did it … put my penis in his mouth.” The appellant both in his record of interview to the police and in his evidence before the jury denied that this or any other act of fellatio had occurred. In his summing up to the jury on this count, the trial judge pointed out that the evidence in support of the prosecution case “… comes from the complainant.” He went on to say “There was no admission in relation to the accused as to that happening and I do not think there is anything - that comes I think, evidence solely from the complainant most of that last matter.” The Crown submits there is some other material in this case which might support the evidence of the complainant on this charge. It is submitted the appellant made an admission to the complainant’s mother relating to this and in terms where what was said to the mother distinguished this event from the second charge (on which the appellant was acquitted) which involved an allegation of an act of fellatio committed between 25 December, 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The complainant’s mother was cross-examined about paragraph 7 of a statement she made on 9 November, 1998. In that statement she detailed how the appellant came to her to tell her about what had occurred between himself and her son, including the words “Your son Guy approached me and asked me to go down on him. We were both intoxicated at the time and I did.” She was cross-examined to establish that the conversation with the appellant had occurred just a few days prior to 9 November and although at first she agreed with that proposition she subsequently made it plain she could not remember when the conversation occurred and ultimately said “Well I don’t know if it was a year before or I am not sure when this took place, how long it was, you know I really can’t. I have no idea, sorry.” The trial judge in dealing with the evidence of the complainant’s mother pointed out to the jury that she had told them she was in remission from cancer and that the cancer had affected her memory. It is clear this witness was far from a satisfactory witness and in particular her evidence as to an admission by the appellant of having engaged in oral sex could have referred to either count two or count six in the indictment which events were said to be one year apart. 
      
       
     10 A second piece of evidence suggested as providing some support for the complainant’s evidence on count 6 is the evidence of a conversation in the taped recording, where the appellant is recorded as saying “… once here on the lounge in the living room and there was once in the garage in the car and that was the one where it was hurting me and I asked you to stop.” The complainant replies “Yeah”. The appellant then says “But you kept going” and the complainant said “But after all that then it was just a head job like” and the appellant responded “Yeah I remember that.” 
      
       
     11 In relation to count 6 it is argued by the appellant that the verdict of guilty is inconsistent with the verdict of not guilty in respect of count 2 and it is also argued the trial judge should have given a warning to the jury alerting them to the dangers of convicting on the evidence of the complainant in respect of that count. It is of some significance therefore to determine if the verdict of guilty on count 6 does rely entirely on the evidence of the complainant. In my view it does. There is nothing in the evidence of the complainant’s mother which points to the fact that there was any confession by the appellant to an act of oral sex towards the end of 1998 as opposed to the act of oral sex towards the end of 1997. She was an unsatisfactory witness and she could not even remember within twelve months as to when the appellant discussed this matter with her. I note that in its address the Crown relies on this evidence of the mother to support both counts 2 and 6. The material from the taped conversation again is not clear enough to draw any clear inferences as to when any suggested act of oral sex occurred and it has to be remembered that the complainant in his evidence clearly contradicted some of the things he is recorded as saying in the taped conversation. Moreover, the trial judge appears to have identified to the jury that the evidence in relation to this count did come entirely from the plaintiff. He certainly did not identify any other material which the jury could find supported the complainant’s version.12 13 These same factual considerations must also give rise to a consideration as to whether or not the verdict on count 6 is inconsistent with the verdict on count 2. The tests to be applied in determining whether verdicts on different counts are inconsistent has been the subject of consideration by this Court in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 where consideration was given to the judgment of the High Court in M v The Queen (1984) 191 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 19 CLR 439 and MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348. These cases emphasise that it is the function of the jury to return verdicts and if there is an appropriate way to reconcile the verdicts, they should be accepted and the appropriate role of the jury respected. In determining that issue, it has been said the test is one of logic and reasonableness.14 15 As I have pointed out above, there was no evidence to support the complainant as to count 6 any more than there was as to count 2 in the indictment and as I observed earlier the Crown in its address relied on the same piece of evidence to support both counts. There was, in my view, no logical or reasonable way in which any jury could ascribe any of the material suggested as relevant to either the second count or the sixth count. The jury quite properly returned a verdict of not guilty on the second count and as a matter of logic the only reasonable verdict to return on the sixth count was also one of not guilty. 
      
       
     16 In R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 it was said that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness should be scrutinised with great care before convicting. That statement of principle has been consistently supported in this Court most recently in R v McNamara [2002] NSWCCA 248 on 21 June, 2002. 17 18 In the case of count 6, in my view a particular warning was called for. The appropriate warning was one which drew the attention of the jury to the danger of convicting on the evidence of one witness alone. This witness contradicted what he had said in the taped conversation in relation to significant matters. He also said at first there were a couple of other times apart from the three he gave evidence about but he couldn’t quite remember what had happened and subsequently he said the three occasions were the only three. The lack of consistency in the evidence of this witness is a good example of why this rule exists. 
      
       
     19 Both for the reason that the trial judge failed to give an appropriate warning to the jury in respect of count 6 and because the verdict in respect of count 6 is inconsistent with the jury’s verdict on count 2, I would allow the appeal on this ground. I would quash the conviction and I would enter a verdict of acquittal. 20 21 I would also propose in this case that leave to appeal against sentence be granted. The appellant was sentenced originally to a period of twelve months imprisonment on count 6 by way of fixed term, and then was sentenced to a period of two years with a non-parole period of one year and three months to commence at the end of that sentence, namely 1 June, 2001. The non-parole period fixed was thus one of one year and three months. His Honour ordered the sentence to be served by way of periodic detention.  
      
       
     22 Apparently, the appellant did not commence the periodic detention sentence immediately, and it was not commenced until 3 January, 2001, and the appellant then served the twelve months sentence by way of full-time custody, partly at least because of another sentence of four months he was given in respect of a driving offence. 
      
       
     23 In any event he was released from full-time custody on 22 December, 2001. He has since been serving the periodic detention order although we are advised that six weeks of the periodic detention sentence has been served by way of full-time custody arising out of some mistake. The appellant therefore has served a period of twelve months full-time custody, and he has now served an extra period of almost six months by way of full-time custody and periodic detention. 
      
       
     24 In my view the amount of time the appellant has served in prison is sufficient time to be served in relation to the three counts on which he remains convicted. The very experienced trial judge in this matter assessed this as a case that was suitable for periodic detention. That is unusual in respect of a case of this kind involving a minor. However, I agree entirely with the assessment of the trial judge.  
      
       
     25 The order that I propose to give effect to that view is that the sentences imposed by the trial judge be quashed and that on each of the three remaining counts the appellant be sentenced to twelve months fixed term of imprisonment to date from 1 June, 2001, each of those sentences to be served concurrently, and I would order that those sentences be served by way of periodic detention. I note that the sentence has already expired and the appellant would not be required to attend prison for any further purpose in respect of the sentence.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 BLANCH AJ: This is an appeal from convictions on four counts of homosexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 10 and 18 at Gosford District Court on 5 April, 2000. The appellant appeared at Gosford District Court on 3 April, 2000 and was indicted on six counts of homosexual intercourse with the complainant who was aged 14 and 15 during the relevant periods contrary to section 78K of the Crimes Act. The first count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 1 October, 1997 and 31 December, 1997. The second count alleged an act of oral intercourse between 25 December, 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The third count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 25 December 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The fourth count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 25 December, 1997 and 31 March, 1998. The fifth count alleged an act of anal intercourse between 1 May, 1998 and 1 July, 1998. The sixth count alleged an act of oral intercourse between 1 August, 1998 and 31 August, 1998. The complainant was born on 2 February, 1983 and the appellant was in his late twenties. 
      
       
     2 At the relevant period the complainant was living with his mother at Wyong. The complainant’s parents had separated in August, 1994 and the complainant’s mother formed a relationship with the appellant in 1997 and lived in a de facto relationship from then at least until the time of trial. 
      
       
     3 At the trial the appellant was convicted of the first, third, fifth and sixth counts and acquitted on the second and fourth counts. 
      
       
     4 On the first count, the evidence supporting the prosecution case came firstly from the complainant who said that prior to Christmas 1997 he was living in the house occupied by his mother and the appellant. He had his own bedroom which contained a trundle bed. He said the appellant came into his room and asked him if he wished to have sex and he then described an episode which led to the appellant removing his pants and lying on his stomach on the trundle bed and then allowing the complainant to have anal sex with him. In a record of interview with the police on 9 November, 1998, the appellant admitted that he had anal sexual intercourse with the complainant on four occasions, one of those occasions being in the complainant’s bedroom. He said that before Christmas 1997 he and the complainant were a bit drunk and the complainant gave him methadone, which the complainant had stolen from his mother, to the appellant. The other evidence supporting this count came from a tape recording of a conversation between the appellant, the complainant and the complainant’s mother which was brought into existence apparently by the appellant and the complainant’s mother about six months after the record of interview. There was a dispute as to whether or not the complainant knew this tape was being made. It was tendered by the defence and part of the conversation on the tape was the appellant saying “It was only the four times it happened. It was once in your bedroom, that was the first time” and the complainant is recorded as saying “Yeah”.  
      
       
     5 The defence to the first count was evidence given by the appellant at his trial that he was anally penetrated by the complainant on four occasions, three of which were without his knowledge. On those three occasions he said he woke up either in his bed or in the lounge room feeling that his “backside was sore”. The appellant said that prior to these occasions the complainant had put methadone in his drink and this had knocked him out and made him go to sleep. He denied that to his knowledge anything of a sexual nature had occurred between him and the complainant in the trundle bed in the bedroom. He asserted the complainant had asked him to lie about the incidents because he did not want his father to find out what the complainant was doing. He said he agreed to do this and his assertion was the misrepresentation he agreed to was that he had consented to the acts of the complainant, whereas in reality the complainant had committed the acts without consent. When he was cross-examined about the taped conversation which he had been partly responsible for bringing into existence, and it was pointed out to him that the conversation indicated he was aware of what the complainant was doing to him, and there was no mention of his being drugged and asleep, the appellant’s answer was “I’ve just forgotten to say it, that’s all.” 
      
       
     6 The appeal in respect of count three has been abandoned and is therefore dismissed. In respect of count five, the appeal has also been abandoned and is therefore dismissed.  
      
       
     7 The evidence in support of the sixth charge comes from the evidence of the complainant who in evidence when asked when was the last time something of a sexual nature happened, said “That was out in my lounge room of my house and that was on the lounge of the house and it was when he asked me if I wanted a head job and I said ‘No I don’t’ … I said ‘No’ about two or three times but then he did it … put my penis in his mouth.” The appellant both in his record of interview to the police and in his evidence before the jury denied that this or any other act of fellatio had occurred. In his summing up to the jury on this count, the trial judge pointed out that the evidence in support of the prosecution case “… comes from the complainant.” He went on to say “There was no admission in relation to the accused as to that happening and I do not think there is anything - that comes I think, evidence solely from the complainant most of that last matter.” The Crown submits there is some other material in this case which might support the evidence of the complainant on this charge. It is submitted the appellant made an admission to the complainant’s mother relating to this and in terms where what was said to the mother distinguished this event from the second charge (on which the appellant was acquitted) which involved an allegation of an act of fellatio committed between 25 December, 1997 and 31 January, 1998. The complainant’s mother was cross-examined about paragraph 7 of a statement she made on 9 November, 1998. In that statement she detailed how the appellant came to her to tell her about what had occurred between himself and her son, including the words “Your son Guy approached me and asked me to go down on him. We were both intoxicated at the time and I did.” She was cross-examined to establish that the conversation with the appellant had occurred just a few days prior to 9 November and although at first she agreed with that proposition she subsequently made it plain she could not remember when the conversation occurred and ultimately said “Well I don’t know if it was a year before or I am not sure when this took place, how long it was, you know I really can’t. I have no idea, sorry.” The trial judge in dealing with the evidence of the complainant’s mother pointed out to the jury that she had told them she was in remission from cancer and that the cancer had affected her memory. It is clear this witness was far from a satisfactory witness and in particular her evidence as to an admission by the appellant of having engaged in oral sex could have referred to either count two or count six in the indictment which events were said to be one year apart. 
      
       
     8 A second piece of evidence suggested as providing some support for the complainant’s evidence on count 6 is the evidence of a conversation in the taped recording, where the appellant is recorded as saying “… once here on the lounge in the living room and there was once in the garage in the car and that was the one where it was hurting me and I asked you to stop.” The complainant replies “Yeah”. The appellant then says “But you kept going” and the complainant said “But after all that then it was just a head job like” and the appellant responded “Yeah I remember that.” 
      
       
     9 In relation to count 6 it is argued by the appellant that the verdict of guilty is inconsistent with the verdict of not guilty in respect of count 2 and it is also argued the trial judge should have given a warning to the jury alerting them to the dangers of convicting on the evidence of the complainant in respect of that count. It is of some significance therefore to determine if the verdict of guilty on count 6 does rely entirely on the evidence of the complainant. In my view it does. There is nothing in the evidence of the complainant’s mother which points to the fact that there was any confession by the appellant to an act of oral sex towards the end of 1998 as opposed to the act of oral sex towards the end of 1997. She was an unsatisfactory witness and she could not even remember within twelve months as to when the appellant discussed this matter with her. I note that in its address the Crown relies on this evidence of the mother to support both counts 2 and 6. The material from the taped conversation again is not clear enough to draw any clear inferences as to when any suggested act of oral sex occurred and it has to be remembered that the complainant in his evidence clearly contradicted some of the things he is recorded as saying in the taped conversation. Moreover, the trial judge appears to have identified to the jury that the evidence in relation to this count did come entirely from the plaintiff. He certainly did not identify any other material which the jury could find supported the complainant’s version. 
      
       
     10 In R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 it was said that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness should be scrutinised with great care before convicting. That statement of principle has been consistently supported in this Court most recently in R v McNamara [2002] NSWCCA 248 on 21 June, 2002. The appropriate warning was one which drew the attention of the jury to the danger of convicting on the evidence of one witness alone. This witness contradicted what he had said in the taped conversation in relation to significant matters. He also said at first there were a couple of other times apart from the three he gave evidence about but he couldn’t quite remember what had happened and subsequently he said the three occasions were the only three. The lack of consistency in the evidence of this witness is a good example of why this rule exists. 
      
       
     11 These same factual considerations must also give rise to a consideration as to whether or not the verdict on count 6 is inconsistent with the verdict on count 2. Both for the reason that the trial judge failed to give an appropriate warning to the jury in respect of count 6 and for the reasons given, in my view the verdict in respect of count 6 is inconsistent with the jury’s verdict on count 2, I would allow the appeal on this ground. I would quash the conviction and I would enter a verdict of acquittal. I would also propose in this case that leave to appeal against sentence be allowed. 
      
       
     12 The appellant was sentenced originally to a period of twelve months imprisonment on count 6 by way of fixed term, and then was sentenced to a period of two years with a non-parole period of one year and three months to commence at the end of that sentence, namely 1 June, 2001. The non-parole period fixed was thus one of one year and three months. His Honour ordered the sentence to be served by way of periodic detention.  
      
       
     13 Apparently the appellant did not commence the periodic detention sentence immediately, and it was not commenced until 3 January, 2001, and the appellant then served the twelve months sentence by way of full-time custody, partly at least because of another sentence of four months he was given in respect of a driving offence. 
      
       
     14 In any event he was released from full-time custody on 22 December, 2001. He has since been serving the periodic detention order although we are advised that six weeks of the periodic detention sentence has been served by way of full-time custody arising out of some mistake. The appellant therefore has served a period of twelve months full-time custody, and he has now served an extra period of almost six months by way of full-time custody and periodic detention. 
      
       
     15 In my view the amount of time the appellant has served in prison is sufficient time to be served in relation to the three counts on which he remains convicted. The very experienced trial judge in this matter assessed this as a case that was suitable for periodic detention. That is unusual in respect of a case of this kind involving a minor. However, I agree entirely with the assessment of the trial judge.  
      
       
     16 The order that I propose to give effect to that view is that the sentences imposed by the trial judge be quashed and that on each count the appellant be sentenced to twelve months fixed term of imprisonment to date from 1 June, 2001, each of those sentences to be served concurrently, and I would order that those sentences be served by way of periodic detention. I note that the sentence has already expired and the appellant would not be required to attend prison for any further purpose in respect of the sentence. 
      
       
     17 HEYDON JA: I agree with Blanch AJ. 
      
       
     18 HIDDEN J: I also agree.

      REGINA v EDWARD CHARLES DURANT 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 O'KEEFE J: Edward Charles Durant (the applicant) who is now aged 53 years and is a citizen of the United Kingdom, was sentenced by Judge Freeman (the judge) in the District Court on 7 May 2001 on two counts of importing a prohibited substance, in one case consisting of 3.4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, or MDMA, and in the other consisting of cannabis resin. 
      
       
     2 The sentence imposed by the judge in respect of the first offence was seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and three months, that is in respect of the charge concerning the ecstasy, and 18 months to be served concurrently in respect of the cannabis resin. 
      
       
     3 The maximum penalty fixed by law for the importation of the ecstasy was 25 years with the possibility of a fine of up to $100,000. The maximum penalty fixed by law in respect of the importation of the cannabis resin was two years imprisonment with a fine of up to $2,000. 
      
       
     4 The facts of the matter are that on 25 December 2000 the applicant, who was travelling with his partner, arrived at Kingsford Smith airport from London having travelled via Rome and Taipei. Whilst awaiting immigration clearance, a drug detection (or sniffer) dog reacted to the applicant who was then in company with his partner. He was asked to recover luggage from the baggage carousel. 
      
       
     5 Examination of the applicant's luggage revealed a pair of women's leather platform-soled sandals, in the compartment in the sole of each of which was a quantity of narcotics, consisting of some 1,800 ecstasy tablets. He admitted to having secreted the narcotics in the sandals and further admitted that he had an additional quantity of ecstasy tablets and other narcotics concealed within his body. These were in a condom which was in his rectum and, when recovered, the package was found to contain additional ecstasy tablets together with a quantity of cannabis resin. When questioned the applicant claimed that his partner had no knowledge of the presence of the narcotics and that the ecstasy tablets had been checked in a laboratory in Holland to ensure that they were not toxic. 
      
       
     6 The total number of ecstasy tablets involved in the importation was 2,213, having a gross weight of a little over half a kilogram. On analysis these were found to contain 166 grams of pure MDMA. This is in excess of a trafficable quantity. The cannabis resin weighed 10.9 grams and was thus below a trafficable quantity. 
      
       
     7 The evidence before the trial judge showed that the street value of the two narcotics lay somewhere between $45,000 and $100,000 which as the judge said, ""Whilst not a huge importation...it could not be said that the drugs of the value in question were trivial amounts"". 
      
       
     8 The applicant was represented at his sentence hearing by experienced counsel. He did not give evidence on the sentence. Before this Court, but not in the notice of appeal, a claim was made that counsel appearing for him was incompetent. As I have said, this is not in the notice of appeal and although referred to in additional material which was placed before the court, there is no evidence that this is so and indeed, the experience of the counsel named in the transcript is inconsistent with such an allegation. 
      
       
     9 Furthermore, there is no indication in the course of the proceedings before the judge that anything done or not done by counsel for the then accused resulted in the sentence which was imposed by the judge, being different from what may have been the case had the applicant had the services of other counsel. 
      
       
     10 The applicant submitted through his counsel that he should be regarded as a mere courier. However, with ample basis for so doing, the judge rejected this submission and was of the view that there was no evidence from which the applicant or otherwise which would militate against the view that he was responsible in a serious and significant way for the importation. Although there was no evidence before the judge as to the amount received by the applicant, in the additional material put before the court on this appeal there is a clear statement that an amount of £10,000 was received by the applicant in respect of his criminal acts. 
      
       
     11 The documentation further revealed that as part of the transaction in which the applicant was involved, he actually purchased the drugs in question and was then going to be paid an additional amount in this country when the drugs were picked up by some other person. 
      
       
     12 The nature of his involvement in the criminal enterprise, which resulted ultimately in the importation of the narcotics into Australia, remains virtually as obscure before this Court as it was before the judge in the court below. 
      
       
     13 In an interview conducted with the applicant at the time of his arrest he claimed that he had been approached in a London bar about carrying the drugs into Australia. However he declined to name the persons involved, either at the London end of the transaction or at the Australian end of the importation. 
      
       
     14 The material before the judge to which I have just adverted suggests a casual encounter and a spur of the moment decision. However, before this Court the applicant has referred to an association with the persons who made the drugs available to him extending for a period of some two years. No mention was made of a mere casual encounter in an hotel. 
      
       
     15 Moreover, at his interview he made no allegation of that kind and there is no evidence of the matters to which reference is made in his additional submissions either before the judge or before this Court. 
      
       
     16 The applicant conceded that he was aware that his behaviour was illegal and it appears quite clear from the material before the judge and before this Court that he did what he did knowing that it was illegal, because of the money that he was going to get for committing the offences. 
      
       
     17 Although this material was included in a probation report which was before the court, the applicant did not verify it, as was his entitlement. This left the judge properly sceptical about the weight to be given to the self-serving statements made by the applicant and included in the probation report. When determining the culpability of the applicant the judge took into account the way in which the applicant had secreted the major part of the narcotics, namely in the sandals, that he had secreted the rest within his body and that before this was done he was aware that the tablets had been checked in a laboratory in Holland to ensure that they were not toxic. The findings by the judge, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         ""This is not a dumb mule, this is not a courier. This is a man who, at least in part, is responsible for the organisation and performance of this importation and the fact is that he would have needed contacts at this end of the journey in order to effect a distribution and make such profit as he was entitled to"" 
         
        
        
       are supported by the evidence before the sentencing judge. 
        
       
     18 Furthermore, the judge's finding he would accept the role of the applicant ""in the scale of culpability as somewhat more than halfway up"" such scale is unexceptional. Indeed, on the evidence in my opinion it is very fair as far as the applicant is concerned. 
      
       
     19 In fixing the sentence the judge took into account the quantity of drugs involved, the elements referred to in s 16 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 and the question of general deterrence. He took into account the plea of guilty and despite the fact that it had been proffered against the background of an extremely strong Crown case, he nonetheless gave a discount of in excess of 10 per cent in respect of the sentence which he would otherwise have imposed. 
      
       
     20 Having regard to the fact that this is a sentence for Commonwealth prosecution imposed under the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that the applicant did not, on any view of the matter, really proffer any assistance to the authorities other than the plea of guilty, I am of the opinion that the fixing of that discount involved no error. 
      
       
     21 The judge also gave a discount on the head sentence because of the absence of remissions in prison sentences imposed and served in New South Wales. This was proper so to do. He further discounted the sentence because the drugs involved, although narcotics and at least in one case quite dangerous, were not as bad in their effects as heroin. He noted, however, that there had been no assistance to the authorities and that the applicant had no family ties in England which would result in a sentence being served in Australia being more impactive upon him and his family than would be the case with another offender. The judge then imposed the sentences referred to above. 
      
       
     22 In my opinion the judge made adequate and well supported findings of fact, applied the appropriate principles and did so correctly. He then imposed sentences which were well within the range which, in the past and over a period, have been imposed in respect of the importation of narcotics into Australia. An examination of the 32 cases included in the schedule to the respondent's outline of submissions shows that the sentence imposed was within the parameters of sentences imposed for mid range drug importations. 
      
       
     23 At the hearing of the appeal before this Court, the applicant sought to rely upon a document entitled ""Appeal Statement."" Although not verified, I am of the opinion that it would be appropriate, having regard to the fact that the applicant is representing himself and he is unversed in the conduct of appeals, to allow that matter to be taken into account in the hearing of this appeal. However, when that is done there is nothing in it, in my opinion, which would give rise to any additional exculpation of the applicant or do anything to reduce the high criminality involved in the actions in which he was involved. Indeed, on one view it puts him a little further up the chain of responsibility than the judge fixed. However, I do not take that into account adversely to the applicant. 
      
       
     24 It is important in my view to bear in mind, in relation to offences of the kind presently before the court, that general deterrence is an important element of the sentencing process. If it is known that heavy penalties will necessarily result from the importation of narcotics into this country, that will undoubtedly have a deterrent effect upon many in the drug importation trade. The sentence fixed by Judge Freeman is one which is capable of such an effect and is appropriate to the seriousness of the offence involved. 
      
       
     25 I would propose that leave to appeal should be granted, but that the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     26 JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
     27 CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree 
      
       
     28 O'KEEFE J: The order of the Court will be that leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: These are two appeals from convictions following two trials of the appellant, each before Acting Judge Wall QC and a jury, and concluding respectively on 11th September 2000 and 16th November 2000.  
      
       
     2 The first trial concerned four charges of indecent assault upon CPS, a male person, pursuant to s.81 of the Crimes Act 1900. The first three charges were of assaults allegedly committed at Parramatta; and the fourth was of an assault allegedly committed at Mosman between about 1st January and 31st December 1977. The dates on the first three counts when the appellant was indicted on 28th August 2000 were “between about 1st October 1976 and 30th April 1977”; but during the trial, on 5th September 2000, these dates were amended to “between 1st January 1977 and 30th June 1977”. The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. On 11th September 2000, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to each count. On 10th April 2001, the appellant was sentenced as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         On each count, to imprisonment for three years and six months to be served concurrently with each other and to commence on 11th September 2000 and expire on 10th March 2004, with a non-parole period of two years and four months to commence on 11th September 2000 and expire on 10th January 2003. 
         
        
       
     3 The second trial concerned seven charges of indecent assault upon TEL, a male person, pursuant to s.81 of the Crimes Act 1900. The respective dates and places were as follows: 
      
       
       Count 1: On or about 18th February 1978 at Cremorne. 
        
       Count 2: Between about 20th and 24th February 1978 at Mosman. 
        
       Count 3: On 17th June 1978 at Randwick. 
        
       Count 4: Between about 18th February and 30th April 1978 at Balgowlah. 
        
       Count 5: Between about 18th February and 30th April 1978 at Parramatta. 
        
       Count 6: Between about 18th February and 30th December 1978 at or near Dural. 
        
       Count 7: Between 10th January and 28th January 1979 at Mosman. 
        
       
     4 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. On 16th November 2000, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to each count. On 10th April 2001, the appellant was sentenced as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         On each count, to imprisonment for four years and six months to be served concurrently with each other and consecutively to the sentences imposed for the offences for CPS, to commence on 11th January 2003 and expire on 10th July 2007, with a non-parole period of three years to commence on 11th January 2003 and expire on 10th January 2006.  
         
        
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     5 It is common ground that the appellant taught Year 3 at Mosman Preparatory School in 1974, 1976, 1977 and 1978. He joined the Army Reserve in 1965 and retired in 1989 when he was 47. In 1977 and 1978, he was a Lieutenant and reserve Quartermaster at the Lancer Barracks at Parramatta. 
      
       
     6 CPS was born on 27th August 1968. The appellant was his teacher at Mosman Preparatory School in 1977. The appellant took CPS to the barracks at Parramatta on at least three occasions.  
      
       
     7 TEL was born on 10th March 1969. The appellant was his teacher at Mosman Preparatory School in 1978. The appellant took TEL to the barracks at Parramatta on about two occasions. 
      
       
     8 There is no doubt that a complaint was made by TEL about alleged sexual assault by the appellant about one week after the last alleged assault on him, and that complaint was conveyed to the headmaster of Mosman Preparatory School. The complaint was then denied by the appellant, but, without there being any determination as to the truth of the complaint, the appellant resigned from the school.  
      
       
     9 Apart from that complaint, no complaint was made by either CPS or TEL until some years later. Following those later complaints, the appellant was interviewed by police in March 1997, and was subsequently arrested.  
      
       
        
       VOIR DIRE HEARING 
       
     10 Trials of the appellant on four separate indictments charging multiple offences of indecent assault on four male persons were listed to commence and proceed “back to back” before Acting Judge Wall with different juries. Prior to the commencement of these trials, there was a substantial voir dire hearing in which the trial judge considered the admissibility of the evidence of each complainant in the trial of charges concerning the other complainants. So far as these appeals are concerned, the relevant matter determined on this voir dire hearing was the admissibility of evidence from TEL in the trial of charges in relation to CPS, and the admissibility of evidence of CPS in the trial of charges relating to TEL.  
      
       
     11 This voir dire hearing required consideration of the effect of ss.95, 97-101, 135, 137 and 192 of the Evidence Act 1995, and also cl.6 of the Evidence Regulation 2000. The Evidence Act sections are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         95(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.  
          
         (2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
          
         (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or  
          
         (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         (2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
          
         (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
          
         (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.  
          
          
         98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:  
          
         (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or  
          
         (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.  
          
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if:  
          
         (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and  
          
         (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.  
          
         (3) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
          
         (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or  
          
         (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.  
          
          
         99 Notices given under section 97 or 98 are to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section.  
          
          
         100(1) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the tendency rule is not to apply to particular tendency evidence despite the party's failure to give notice under section 97.  
          
         (2) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the coincidence rule is not to apply to particular coincidence evidence despite the party's failure to give notice under section 98.  
          
         (3) The application may be made either before or after the time by which the party would, apart from this section, be required to give, or to have given, the notice.  
          
         (4) In a civil proceeding, the party's application may be made without notice of it having been given to one or more of the other parties.  
          
         (5) The direction:  
          
         (a) is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and  
          
         (b) may be given either at or before the hearing.  
          
         (6) Without limiting the court's power to impose conditions under this section, those conditions may include one or more of the following:  
          
         (a) a condition that the party give notice of its intention to adduce the evidence to a specified party, or to each other party other than a specified party,  
          
         (b) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified tendency evidence, or all tendency evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified tendency evidence,  
          
         (c) a condition that the party give such notice only in respect of specified coincidence evidence, or all coincidence evidence that the party intends to adduce other than specified coincidence evidence.  
          
          
         101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.  
          
         (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  
          
         (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.  
          
         (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         135 The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:  
          
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or  
          
         (b) be misleading or confusing, or  
          
         (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         137 In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
          
          
         … 
          
          
         192(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.  
          
         (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
          
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and  
          
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and  
          
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
          
         (d) the nature of the proceeding, and  
          
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.  
         
        
       
     12 The Evidence Regulation clause is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         6(1) This clause is made for the purpose of section 99 of the Act.  
          
         (2) A notice given under section 97 (1) (a) of the Act (relating to the tendency rule) must state:  
          
         (a) the substance of the evidence of the kind referred to in that subsection that the party giving the notice intends to adduce, and  
          
         (b) if that evidence consists of, or includes, evidence of the conduct of a person, particulars of:  
          
           
           (i) the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which the conduct occurred, and  
            
           (ii) the name of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the conduct, and  
            
           (iii) in a civil proceeding - the address of each person so named, so far as they are known to the notifying party.  
           
          
         (3) A notice given under section 98 (1) (a) of the Act (relating to the coincidence rule) must state:  
          
         (a) the substance of the evidence of the occurrence of two or more related events that the party giving the notice intends to adduce, and  
          
         (b) particulars of:  
          
           
           (i) the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which each of those events occurred, and  
            
           (ii) the name of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived each of those events, and  
            
           (iii) in a civil proceeding - he address of each person so named, so far as they are known to the notifying party.  
           
          
         (4) On the application of a party in a criminal proceeding, the court may make an order directing the notifying party to disclose the address of any person named in a notice given under this clause who saw, heard or otherwise perceived conduct or events referred to in the notice.  
          
         (5) The direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.  
         
        
       
     13 In his decision given on 24th July 2000, the trial judge outlined the matters alleged in relation to CPS and TEL, and then considered in turn questions concerning tendency evidence, coincidence evidence, and relationship evidence. 
      
       
     14 In relation to tendency evidence, the trial judge said this: 
      
       
        
         
         As explained by Hunt CJ in CL in R. v Lock (S.C.25 March 1997) – 
          
           
           Section 56 of the Evidence Act provides that evidence, which is relevant in a proceeding, is admissible unless otherwise provided in the Act. It is relevant where, if accepted, it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in that proceeding (S55). Tendency evidence which is otherwise relevant in that sense is nevertheless made inadmissible to prove that a person acts in a particular way if the Court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced, have significant probative value (S97). Where the evidence is to be led by the prosecution about the accused person, it cannot be used against the accused unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused (S101). Alternatively, the accused person may persuade the Court that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to him, in which case the Court must exclude the evidence (S137). As the Crown must first satisfy the requirements of S101, there would appear to be effectively no room for S137 to operate in relation to tendency evidence unless S101(3) applies. 
           
          
          
         S101(3) has no application on the question to be determined by me, as the Crown does not seek to adduce the tendency evidence to explain or contradict tendency evidence to be ""adduced"" by the accused. For evidence from three complainant's of the accused's sexual conduct and tendency towards them to be admitted as tendency evidence in support of the allegations of the fourth, the Crown must establish to my satisfaction that this evidence has first, significant probative value (S97) and secondly, the probative value substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect it would have on the accused. 
          
          
         The first question to be determined by me is whether the evidence sought to be adduced has the quality of significant probative value. In  
         Pfennig v The Queen  
         (1995) 182 CLR 461, propensity (or tendency) evidence was referred to by the High Court as being circumstantial in nature, and as such raising the objective improbability of some event having occurred other than as asserted by the Crown - in other words there must be no reasonable view of the evidence available which is consistent with the innocence of the accused. Put another way, in determining whether the evidence has the quality of being tendency evidence with a significant probative value which substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect the question to be addressed by me is to ask whether there is available a rational (or reasonable) view of the tendency evidence which is consistent with the innocence of the accused; it is only if there is not such view available that a conclusion can safely be reached that the probative force of the evidence is significant and outweighs its prejudicial effect  
         (Pfennig  
         at 482 - 483, 528). As was remarked in  
         Pfennig,  
         the prejudicial effect of propensity (tendency) evidence is that the ordinary person naturally thinks that a person who has an established propensity whenever a particular opportunity arises will therefore have yielded to that propensity in the circumstances of the particular case. 
          
          
         If I were to admit this evidence as tendency evidence it would be my duty to direct the Jury that they must not treat the evidence as establishing an inference of guilt because, if accepted, it shows the accused has or had a tendency or propensity to commit offences of this kind. I would be bound to direct the Jury that they could only use this evidence, either by itself or with other evidence adduced, against the accused if they were satisfied that there must be no reasonable view of the evidence which is consistent with the innocence of the accused. Again in Pfennig p.529 McHugh J. expressed the view; 
          
           
           ""If the risk of an unfair trial is very high the probative value of evidence disclosing criminal propensity may need to be so cogent that it makes the guilt of the accused a virtual certainty"". 
           
          
          
         Counsel for both parties have provided written submissions. The written submissions provide a useful and comprehensive outline of the relevant principles and authorities. In pp. 6 to 8 of his written submissions Counsel for the accused set out a detailed analysis of similarities and differences in the accounts of the four complainants in relation to the physical aspects of the assaults, the reported attitude of the accused after the assaults and the places where the assaults took place. He submitted that an examination of this evidence disclosed that the similarities of the accounts are far outweighed by the differences and that in consequence the complaints lack the requisite ""signature"" elements that must be common for the evidence to be admitted as tendency evidence. 
          
          
         In pp. 2 to 3 in her written submissions Counsel for the Crown gave a comprehensive analysis of points of similarity (15 in all). She submitted that the points of similarity in the accounts given by the four complainants are so strikingly similar that the evidence has the quality of having significant probative value, which substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect on the accused. 
          
          
         I have given careful consideration to the content of the evidence sought to be admitted as tendency evidence including the evidence relied upon by the Crown as disclosing ""guilty passion"" and to the arguments of Counsel on the point in issue under s.97 of the Evidence Act. 
          
          
         In my view, although there are many points of similarity as argued by the Crown in the accounts given by the four complainants, the content of their evidence, taking it large and fine, does not demonstrate the high degree of similarity, an underlying signature or an identifiable hallmark, as it is sometimes put, which is required for admission as tendency evidence. 
          
          
         Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the tendency evidence sought to be adduced has that quality of ""significant probative value"" i.e., circumstantial evidence alone or with other evidence in the case clearly pointing to the guilt of the accused and allowing for no other rational conclusion other than that the accused is guilty. However, if I be wrong in this conclusion, I am nonetheless satisfied that if it were to be admitted there would be a high risk that the Jury would treat the evidence by itself as establishing the guilt of the accused i.e., that because of a propensity to commit offences of this kind he yielded to his sexual desires when the opportunity arose. This danger of prejudicial effect in my view is not substantially outweighed by any significant probative value the evidence may have. 
         
        
       
     15 In relation to coincidence evidence, the trial judge said this: 
      
       
        
         
         S.98(1) relevantly provides that evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act if the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced, have significant probative value. Sub-sec. 2 provides that 2 or more events are to be taken to be related events if and only if they are substantially and relevantly similar and the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. Sec.101(2) provides that coincidence evidence cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
          
          
         At common law evidence of similar acts committed by the accused against different persons was admissible to prove the improbability of the same story being told by a number of persons provided that the trial judge was satisfied that there was no reasonable possibility of concoction. See Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292 where it was held that the possibility of concoction was a matter which had to be considered by the trial judge when determining to admit such evidence. At p.300 Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment of Lord Wilberforce in Reg. v. Boardman (1975) A.C .421, at p.444: 
          
           
           ""This probative force is derived, if at all, from the circumstance that the facts testified to by the several witnesses bear to each other such a striking similarity that they must, when judged by experience and common sense, all be true, or have arisen from a cause common to the witnesses or from pure coincidence. The jury may, therefore, properly be asked to judge whether the right conclusion is that all are true, so that each story is supported by the other(s). 
            
            
           I use the words ""a cause common to the witnesses"" not only .... the possibility that the witnesses may have invented a story in concert but also the possibility that a similar story may have arisen by process of infection from media of publicity or simply from fashion. In the sexual field, and in others, this may be a real possibility: something much more than mere similarity and absence of proved conspiracy is needed if this evidence is to be allowed. This is well illustrated by Reg. v. Kilbourne (1973) A.C. 729 where the judge excluded ""intra group"" evidence because of the possibility  
           as it appeared to him 
           , of collaboration between boys who knew each other well. This is, in my respectful opinion, the right course rather than to admit the evidence unless a case of collaboration or concoction is made out. 
            
            
           If this test is to be applied fairly, much depends in the first place upon the experience and common sense of the judge."" (Original emphasis.) 
           
          
          
         Although the coincidence rule does not contain any such test of admissibility, I am satisfied the legal position is that before the evidence can meet the test of admissibility under the Act, there must be no reasonable possibility of concoction or contamination before the evidence can be admitted. 
          
          
         In R v Colby (CCA (NSW) 26 August 1999) unreported, it was held that before evidence led by the Crown to rebut coincidence can be admitted the judge has to be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence is the result of a concoction on the part of the witnesses giving the evidence ... the chance of concoction must be a real one and not merely speculative. It was held that the trial judge would have regard to the relationship of the persons, their motivations and opportunities for concoction. 
          
          
         An Issue of Concoction and or Contamination 
          
         Counsel for the accused submitted that there was a real possibility of concoction and or contamination in relation to the allegations made to the Police by …, [TEL] and … in their police statements. The basis for this submission is the publication on the front page of a local newspaper, The Mosman Daily on 31st October 1996, of allegations made by [CPS] in civil proceedings instituted by him against [WRC] for indecent assaults committed in a 4 wheel drive motor vehicle at army barracks and in a stenciling (sic) room at the Mormon Prep School. There was a further publication in the Sydney Morning Herald on 1 November 1996 and again in The Mormon (sic) Daily in March 1997 of the allegations against the accused made by [CPS]. 
          
          
         Counsel for the accused also 
           
         submitted that a possibility of concoction and or contamination stemmed from the contact of the three complainants with Mr. and Mrs. Dale who conducted support group meetings, … and the contact between [TEL] and [CPS's] solicitor who later became [TEL's] solicitor. 
          
          
         In the voire dire examination I carried out an extensive enquiry on this issue which included the examination and cross examination of all four complainants, family members of …, [CPS] and …, Mr. and Mrs. Dale and finally the investigating Police Case Officer. 
          
          
         All these witnesses impressed as credible witnesses. I accept them to be honest witnesses who did their best to tell the truth, as they knew it. They were subjected to a searching cross-examination, which left them unshaken in relation to their assertions given in chief. 
          
          
         I have closely examined the evidence and given careful attention to the arguments of Counsel for the parties on this issue. 
          
          
         It does appear to me that there is no reasonable possibility that …, [TEL] and … have concocted the substance of their allegations of sexual abuse by [WRC] as a result of learning of the [CPS] allegations in the newspapers or through a common cause. [TEL], through his mother, complained to the school authorities in February 1979 that he had been masturbated on more than one occasion by the accused at army barracks at Parramatta. This assertion is corroborated in notes made by the head of the school council who interviewed [TEL] in February 1979 in relation to his allegations. 
          
          
         On my review of the evidence it does not appear to me that there is any ground for asserting that the allegations made by [TEL] in his police statement, which are sought to be admitted by the Crown as coincidence evidence, stem from him becoming aware of the [CPS] allegations. There is no evidence he read the newspaper articles. His evidence is that he did not. There is no evidence that he came in contact with [CPS] before he made his police statement. There is evidence that he did not. There is no evidence that he was made aware of the [CPS] allegations by [CPS's] solicitor. There is evidence he was not. There is no evidence that he came in contact with Mr. and Mrs. Dale and their support group before he made his police statement. There is evidence that he did not. 
          
          
         On the evidence the Crown has satisfied me that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence of [TEL] and [CPS] has been concocted or has arisen from a cause common to them both. 
          
          
         I have given careful attention to the submissions made by Counsel for the parties on the question whether the coincidence evidence sought to be admitted satisfies the tests under s.98 and s.101. In my view, the account given by [CPS] of his experiences with the accused in the stenciling (sic) room event and the army barracks event when compared with the account given by [TEL] of his experiences with the accused at these locations, provide striking similarities of patterns of behaviour by the accused towards both. The detail of the similarities is set out in the written and oral submissions of the Crown. 
          
          
         I am satisfied that the coincidence evidence sought to be adduced from [TEL] and [CPS] as outlined above is strongly probative and has such cogency that the evidence satisfies the tests set out in s.98 and s.101 of the Evidence Act. 
          
          
         Accordingly I rule that this evidence is admissible. 
          
         
        
       
     16 In relation to relationship evidence, the trial judge said this: 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown seeks to have evidence admitted in each trial on an indictment of conduct by the accused not charged in the indictment but similar in relation to an indecent assault charged in order to rebut any suggestion of the offences being committed in isolation and to give the true and proper context to the allegations made by a particular complainant. Counsel for the accused opposes the admission of the relationship evidence and seeks to have it excluded under the discretions empowering the Court to exclude this evidence under s.135 or s.137. 
          
          
         I am satisfied if the mandatory directions to the Jury are given in relation to the use of this evidence the probative value of the relationship evidence would not be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under s.137 or that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused or be misleading or confusing (to the Jury) under s.135. 
          
          
         I am empowered under s.136 to limit the use to be made of this evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused. 
          
          
         I can foresee that if the Crown were to question a complainant in detail about similar misconduct to that charged in the indictment i.e. to go into chapter and verse of when where and how the similar misconduct occurred the accused would be unfairly prejudiced. He would not only have to meet the cases charged in the indictment but a host of other similar allegations of a substantive nature. 
          
          
         The proper course for the admission of this evidence is to limit the Crown to asking a complainant in effect: ""Apart from these matters charged in the indictment were there other occasions when you were dealt with by the accused in a similar way in relation to touching your genitalia?"" and then go no further than that; then upon receiving an affirmative ask: ""If asked, could you give evidence of those occasions?"" 
         
        
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
     17 The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal in relation to the charges concerning CPS: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the witness TL 
          
         2. The directions given by the learned trial judge on the use the jury may make of the evidence of TL were inadequate and erroneous. 
          
         3. The directions given by the learned trial judge on the impact of the delay in bringing the complaints were inadequate. 
         
        
       
     18 He relied on the same grounds in relation to the charges concerning TEL, substituting “CS” for “TL”.  
      
       
     19 I will deal in turn with the three grounds, concerning both cases. In considering the third ground, I will also deal with an application by the applicant to add two further grounds of appeal in the CPS case.  
      
       
        
       ADMISSIBILITY OF COINCIDENCE AND RELATIONSHIP EVIDENCE 
       
     20 The appellant relied on three separate arguments:  
      
       
       1. The trial judge’s failure to have regard to the notice requirements of s.99 of the Evidence Act.  
        
       2. Inconsistency between the trial judge’s findings concerning tendency evidence and those concerning coincidence evidence, and associated with this, error by the trial judge in finding that there were striking similarities of patterns of behaviour justifying admission of the evidence as coincidence evidence.  
        
       3. Error by the trial judge in not finding a reasonable possibility of contamination. 
        
        
       Notice 
       
     21 In written submissions, Mr. Byrne SC for the appellant submitted that the notice given for the purposes of s.98 did not comply with s.99 and cl.6 of the Evidence Regulations. However, Mr. Smith for the Crown pointed out that on 5th July 2000 the trial judge made an order under s.100(1) dispensing with notice, pursuant to s.192(1); and that in any event, prior to the trial judge’s judgment on 24th July 2000, the Crown had served a further notice which did comply. There was no oral submission on this aspect made by Mr. Byrne, and in my opinion the Crown’s response does dispose of this aspect.  
      
       
        
       Probative Value and Prejudice 
       
     22 Mr. Byrne referred to Pfennig v. The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461, and submitted that, just as the evidence in question did not demonstrate the high degree of similarity required for admission of tendency evidence having regard to ss.97 and 101 of the Evidence Act, it did not demonstrate sufficient similarity to justify admission as coincidence evidence having regard to ss.98 and 101 of the Evidence Act. The alleged similarities were merely that both were young pupils of the appellant, both alleged sexual assault by masturbation by the appellant, and both identified the same places where assaults occurred (a stencil room at the school and army barracks at Parramatta). Both were places known to be visited by the appellant, and were neither secret or unexpected.  
      
       
     23 Mr. Byrne also submitted that the trial judge was in error in admitting relationship evidence by the corroborating witness in each case.  
      
       
     24 Mr. Smith submitted that Pfennig did not apply, because the matter was governed by the Evidence Act: cf. R v. OGD (No.2) (2000) 50 NSWLR 433.  
      
       
     25 In my opinion, Pfennig is highly relevant to the effect of ss.97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act, in that the principles there stated concerning circumstances in which the probative force of similar fact evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect are directly applicable to questions raised for decision by ss.101 and 137 of the Evidence Act: R v. AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702. OGD does not suggest the contrary.  
      
       
     26 The essence of the approach to similar fact evidence, such as propensity evidence, established by Pfennig appears in the following passage from the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane J and Dawson J at 482-3:  
      
       
        
         
         Because propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence, its probative force is to be gauged in the light of its character as such. But because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused. (Hoch (1988) 165 CLR at 296 (where Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ expressed agreement with the remarks of Dawson J in Sutton (1984) 152 CLR at 564). See also Harriman (1989) 167 CLR at 602). Here ""rational"" must be taken to mean ""reasonable"" (See Peacock v. The King (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; Plomp v. The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234) and the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context of the prosecution case; that is to say, he or she must regard the evidence as a step in the proof of that case. Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. And, unless the tension between probative force and prejudicial effect is governed by such a principle, striking the balance will continue to resemble the exercise of a discretion rather than the application of a principle. 
         
        
       
     27 Plainly, that passage does not mean that the judge must look at the propensity evidence in isolation, and not admit it unless there is no reasonable view of the evidence so considered that is consistent with the innocence of the accused of the offence with which the accused stands charged. That approach would be quite inconsistent with the correct approach for considering circumstantial evidence, as explained in Shepherd v. The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573; and the quoted passage proceeds by reference to the character of propensity evidence as circumstantial evidence. 
      
       
     28 On the other hand, nor can it mean that the judge must look at all the evidence in the case, including the propensity evidence, and admit the propensity evidence if and only if there is no reasonable view of all the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused: that approach would disregard altogether the need for some special probative value of the propensity evidence.  
      
       
     29 In my opinion, what it must mean is that, if it first be assumed that all the other evidence in the case left the jury with a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, the propensity evidence must be such that, when it is considered along with the other evidence, there will then be no reasonable view that is consistent with the innocence of the accused. That is, the propensity evidence must be such that, when it is added to the other evidence, it would eliminate any reasonable doubt which might be left by the other evidence.  
      
       
     30 In the present case, evidence was not admitted as tendency evidence under s.97, but as coincidence evidence under s.98. In order to consider its admissibility in accordance with s.98, and also to consider whether the requirements of s.101 were satisfied, it is necessary to be clear as to precisely what gave the coincidence evidence in this case its probative value.  
      
       
     31 In some cases, the probative value of coincidence evidence arises entirely from some striking similarity or peculiarity of the related events themselves, which supports an inference that the same person was involved in them. In such cases, if it is shown that the accused was involved in one such event or was the only person who could have been involved in both or all such events, an inference may be drawn that it was the accused who was involved in both or all of them.  
      
       
     32 In other cases, the probative value of the coincidence evidence arises not merely from the related events, but also, and especially, from the circumstance that two or more persons independently give evidence of the related events, where it is improbable that they would have given accounts with such similarity unless both or all accounts had foundation in fact. In such cases, in my view, the related events need not necessarily have such striking similarity as is required where it is only the events themselves that are said to have probative value. However, in such cases, the exclusion of any reasonable possibility of joint concoction or contamination is absolutely crucial to the probative value of the coincidence evidence: cf. Ananthanarayanan (1994) 98 Cr.App.R. 1, R. v. Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261. 
      
       
     33 In each of the present cases, the coincidence evidence was plainly of the latter kind. The crucial question at issue was not whether, given that certain events occurred, it was WRC who was responsible: rather, it was whether or not the events themselves occurred. What could strongly support the probability that the events occurred is that two persons independently gave such similar accounts. Leaving to one side for the moment the possibility of concoction or contamination, there is very high improbability of two persons independently coming forward with such similar stories, unless those stories had a factual basis. In my opinion, that is one reason why, accepting that the material was not sufficient for tendency evidence, which must depend only upon objective fact, rather than upon two or more persons giving similar stories, the material may be sufficient for coincidence evidence.  
      
       
     34 Viewed in that way, in my opinion the evidence is of significant probative value, as required by s.98. The question then is whether that probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect (s.101), or whether the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs its probative value (s.137). There may also be a question whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial (s.135). Despite the variations in wording, in my opinion if the evidence satisfies s.101, it will necessarily satisfy s.137 and not be liable to discretionary rejection under s.135.  
      
       
     35 In order to decide whether the s.101 test is satisfied, it is necessary to consider whether the criterion laid down in Pfennig is met, at this stage leaving to one side the question of concoction or contamination, a matter subject to separate submissions. Let us suppose that a jury had a reasonable doubt, in the case of CPS, in the absence of the evidence of TEL. Would the evidence of TEL then leave no reasonable view consistent with the innocence of the appellant? In my opinion, the answer is yes. In my opinion, assuming there is no reasonable possibility of concoction or contamination, it is not reasonably possible that two persons could come forward with stories with the similarities of the stories of CPS and TEL unless they had foundation in fact.  
      
       
     36 This approach could raise a question which was not the subject of submissions either below or in this Court. Since the coincidence is not merely the similarity of objective circumstances related by the two witnesses, but also and primarily the fact that two witnesses should independently relate such similar circumstances, the improbability that gives the evidence its probative force is not so much the improbability of the related events themselves occurring coincidentally, as contemplated by s.98(1), as the improbability of two witnesses independently coming forward with evidence of related events unless their evidence had foundation in fact. One view could be that s.98 is a section that excludes evidence in certain circumstances so that if its terms do not precisely refer to certain evidence, then it does not apply to that evidence, and accordingly s.101 also does not apply. However, on that view there would be nothing in the Evidence Act to exclude application of the Pfennig approach, so the same result would follow. 
      
       
     37 As regards the relationship evidence, I see no error in the decision of the trial judge to allow relationship evidence in relation to the corroborating witness in each case, to the limited extent indicated by his Honour’s judgment. There is force in the considerations discussed in the judgment of Greg James J, but in my opinion the course taken by the trial judge was a reasonable compromise. On the one hand, it avoided the complainants presenting a misleading picture of what they claimed to be their relationship with the appellant; and on the other, it avoided going into extraneous details. It was not prejudicial to the appellant, because the complainants’ assertions that there were other occasions of abuse had no greater credibility than their assertions about the events the subject of the charges. 
      
       
        
       Contamination 
       
     38 Mr. Byrne submitted that the evidence should have been excluded in each case because a “reasonable possibility” of contamination had not been excluded: Hoch v. The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292, BRS v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 301. 
      
       
     39 In order to assess this submission, it is necessary to set out briefly some history concerning the accounts given by the two complainants.  
      
       
     40 In February 1979, TEL made allegations to the school, recorded in contemporary notes, that WRC “had stroked [his] penis” “on two separate Saturdays” when WRC and TEL “had gone by themselves to army barracks at Parramatta”.  
      
       
     41 TEL and CPS were in different years at the school, and on the evidence did not know each other at school and had no contact in the years between their time at the school and 1997.  
      
       
     42 Prior to 31st October 1996, CPS consulted a solicitor, giving rise to civil proceedings against WRC and Mosman Preparatory School. He made a statement to his solicitor Mr. Zacharatos which alleged, inter alia, that in 1976 WRC took him to army barracks on a Sunday and there masturbated him, and that this was repeated five or six times in 1976 to 1977. The statement also alleged an incident when TEL went with WRC at the school to “a small room where stencils were printed” and WRC masturbated him there. A copy of this statement was given to the Mosman Daily newspaper, which on 31st October 1996 published an article, reporting that proceedings had been commenced in the Supreme Court by CES, and setting out the following quotation from the statement of claim and description of its contents: 
      
       
        
         
         “The (teacher) took the plaintiff into a small room where stencils were printed at the school, placed the plaintiff on his lap, undid the plaintiff’s pants and masturbated him.” The statement tells of similar incidents at an army barracks. 
         
        
       
     43 An article was published about the matter in the Sydney Morning Herald on 1st November 1996, including the following paragraph: 
      
       
        
         
         In his Statement of Claim filed in the court [CPS] alleges a number of incidents, including one when the teacher masturbated him in a room at the school and a similar experience at an Army barracks.  
         
        
       
     44 In January 1997, CPS gave a statement to the police, which identified the army barracks at which an assault took place as Holsworthy. WRC was subsequently arrested and charged, and in March 1997, the Mosman Daily newspaper reported the arrest, and in that article gave the name of CPS’s solicitors.  
      
       
     45 TEL’s mother then contacted TEL, and TEL contacted those solicitors. According to TEL, he did not read any of the articles and did not know their content. TEL attended at the solicitor’s offices, and there spoke to Mr. Zacharatos, who prepared a typed statement. TEL then went to the police and made a statement on 2nd April 1997. This statement referred to a number of assaults occurring in “the stencilling room” at the school, and also assaults at Holsworthy Army Base.  
      
       
     46 Later, TEL went to see Sue Dale, who had established a support group for victims of child sexual abuse, and who had also seen CPS.  
      
       
     47 Subsequently, both CPS and TEL independently came to the view that the assaults did not take place at Holsworthy, and both independently went to army barracks at Parramatta, and asserted that the assaults took place there.  
      
       
     48 Mr. Byrne submitted that there was clear contamination in relation to the assertion that assaults occurred at Holsworthy Army Base, and that this showed the suggestibility, at least of TEL, if not also CPS. In relation to the reference to the stencilling room, in each case the same solicitor took the first statement, and there was also a reasonable possibility that, despite his denials, the reference to a stencilling room in TEL’s statement came directly or indirectly from the newspaper report.  
      
       
     49 In my opinion, there is no reasonable possibility of contamination in relation to the fact and nature of the assaults or the location of some of the assaults at Parramatta barracks. TEL had reported both the nature of the assaults and the occurrence of assaults at Parramatta barracks in February 1979. Parramatta barracks were the barracks with which WRC was associated. CPS in 1996 alleged the nature of the assaults and that assaults occurred at barracks, although in the original statement to police he identified the barracks as Holsworthy. When TEL later identified the barracks as Holsworthy, it may well be that this was due to his contact with CPS’s solicitor, but this would not amount to contamination affecting the essential facts stated earlier. Both CPS and TEL independently corrected the identification of the barracks after they visited the Parramatta barracks. 
      
       
     50 As regards the stencilling room, the position is not so clear. Although TEL denied on oath that he had read or become aware of the contents of the newspaper reports, and although he was accepted as a witness of truth by the trial judge, the existence of a report which made public an allegation concerning a stencilling room and TEL’s contact with CPS’s solicitor, at a time before TEL had apparently mentioned a stencilling room to anyone else, could raise a reasonable possibility of contamination. If the reference to a stencilling room had been the sole, or even the primary, similarity of the stories, I may not have been satisfied that a reasonable possibility of contamination had been excluded. Having regard to the very powerful effect of the evidence, the very existence of a public source from which the sole or primary similarity could have been derived could in my view have been enough to exclude it. 
      
       
     51 However, the reference to the stencilling room is only one aspect of the two stories, having only an incremental effect on the force of the evidence. In my opinion, even without any reference to the stencilling room, the other similarities in the evidence about which there is no reasonable possibility of contamination are sufficient to pass the Pfennig test. Where there has been no contamination in relation to the substance of the evidence, a small possibility of contamination concerning one incremental aspect of the evidence does not mean that the s.101 criteria have not been satisfied. There may be cases where it is appropriate to edit the evidence in order to minimise the danger of prejudice. I do not think that would have been appropriate here: the reference to the stencilling room was integral to the accounts of the assaults, and did not in my opinion significantly increase the danger of prejudice. 
      
       
        
       DIRECTIONS ON COINCIDENCE EVIDENCE 
       
     52 The trial judge gave the following direction in the case of CPS: 
      
       
        
         
         In this trial the Crown has led evidence from TEL that the accused indecently assaulted him at the Parramatta Army Barracks in 1978 when he was a pupil in a class taught by the accused. The Crown is permitted to lead this evidence in relation to counts one, two and three in proof of the offences charged in those counts but on a strictly limited basis. 
          
          
         I shall explain to you the use you may make of this evidence and, most importantly, the use you must not make of this evidence. And I emphasis: The use you must not make of this evidence. 
          
          
         The Crown has also led evidence from TEL that he was indecently assaulted at the Mosman Preparatory School in 1978 in a room in which there was stencilling/copying equipment. The Crown was permitted to lead this evidence from TEL in relation to count four as proof of the offences charged in that count. That again is on the same strictly limited basis. 
          
          
         I shall explain to you the use you may make of this evidence and, most importantly, the use you must not make of this evidence. And again I emphasis: The use you must not make of this evidence. 
          
          
         First, before you may consider this evidence of TEL in support of the Crown case in counts one, two and three you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of his evidence that he was indecently assaulted by the accused at the barracks. 
          
          
         The Crown bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt he is a witness of truth on this disputed issue. If the Crown fails to so satisfy you then you must, I emphasize, you must entirely disregard the evidence of TEL that he was indecently assaulted at the barracks. You must not use it in any way in support of the Crown case that CPS has given truthful evidence of the indecent assaults charged. Secondly, if the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the evidence of TEL that the accused indecently assaulted him at the barracks you must not treat his evidence as establishing an inference of guilt of the offences charged in counts one, two and three by reasoning that he had a tendency or a propensity to commit offences of this kind. This is a false and irrational reasoning as I said at an earlier time in the trial when I explained it to you. The law does not allow the evidence of TEL to be used in this way. The way and the only way the Crown may legitimately use the evidence of TEL that he was indecently assaulted at the Lancer Barracks is this; the Crown submits to you that the circumstances that CPS and TEL have testified to you about the way in which the accused indecently assaulted them at the barracks by acts of masturbation to their penis bare to each other such a striking similarity that they must, when judged by experience and common sense (a) both be true or (b) have arisen from a cause common to both, that is collaboration, that they got together and invented a common story or their similar stories have arisen by each being exposed to a process of suggestion or contamination from an outside source or finally, (c) have resulted from pure coincidence. 
          
          
         Now exactly the same principles apply in relation to the question whether the Crown is permitted by law and if permitted that its legitimate use of the evidence of TEL that the was indecently assaulted at the Mosman Prep School in support of proof of the offence charged in count four of the indictment. The Crown relies on the evidence of TEL to persuade you that his evidence supports CPS's evidence; that it points to it being true and argues its case in this way. The Crown submits to you that TEL's account of the circumstances of how he was indecently assaulted on occasions whilst seated on the accused's lap at the barracks and in a room at the school is not merely a similar account to that given by CPS but has such a high degree of similarity as to be an identical description of the circumstances in which the accounts of indecency constituting the indecent assaults charged were committed. 
          
          
         If you accept this to be the case the Crown submits to you that it is impossible TEL's evidence of indecent assaults can be the result of coincidence. I direct you that on this question whether TEL's evidence leads to a conclusion that his account of being indecently assaulted cannot reasonably be explained by coincidence that the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the account of indecent assault given by TEL when compared to the acts of indecent assaults given by CPS have such a striking similarity, such a close similarity, such a clear underlying unity between both accounts as to make coincidence an improbable explanation for what they each say happened to them at the hand of the accused. 
          
          
         Mere similarity of account which raises or deepens a submission that the accused committed the offences charged is not sufficient. When considering the evidence of TEL and the use sought to be made by the Crown you should also consider the submission put to you by counsel for the accused that on the evidence you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of his evidence of indecent assaults and the matters raised with you by him in support of that submission. 
          
          
         You should also consider his submission that the Crown has not demonstrated that TEL's account of indecent assaults is strikingly similar with that given by CPS. Counsel asked you to consider both accounts where alleged acts of masturbation took place and that by the nature of the act it can only be described in one way, therefore he argued no significance can be attached or could be attached to the fact that TEL described the act of masturbation in a similar way to CPS. 
          
          
         The Crown submits to you that the evidence in the Crown case that there had been no contact between CPS and TEL whilst they were pupils at the school or thereafter has not been challenged by the accused. The Crown submits that there is no evidence that CPS and TEL have collaborated in giving their accounts of being indecently assaulted by the accused and there is no evidence that their account could have arisen from a cause common to them both. 
          
          
         Counsel for the accused has told you that it is not part of the defence case that CPS and TEL have put their heads together so as to contaminate their accounts of a sexual abuse. He told you the issues of suggestion goes only to the effect of CPS's earlier reference to Holsworthy and TEL's early reference to Holsworthy as to where they say the assaults took place. The Crown submits to you that in these circumstances the only rational explanation left for what it says is a striking degree of similarity if not an identical case of indecent assault, is that they are both true. It is in this way the Crown relies on the evidence of TEL to support the evidence of CPS that the offences charged were committed. Whether in the light of these directions as to the permissible use of the evidence of TEL and the argument of both counsel on the point you are persuaded that evidence supports the evidence of CPS that he was indecently assaulted by the accused is entirely a matter for you to decide. 
         
        
       
     53 Mr. Byrne submitted that there were a number of errors in these directions. 
      
       
     54 In the passage where his Honour said that “the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that” the two versions “have such a close similarity … as to make coincidence an improbable explanation”, the trial judge, Mr. Byrne submitted, erroneously mixed the concepts of “beyond reasonable doubt” and “improbable”, and also set the standard too low. What had to be shown was that the coincidence was so improbable that there was no other reasonable explanation. 
      
       
     55 Next, Mr. Byrne submitted, there were error in the references to the question of whether the versions were strikingly similar or whether there was the possibility of contamination, in that this was confusing to the jury and also re-visited matters dealt with on the voir dire. Mr. Byrne submitted that it was not fair to the appellant to put that the evidence of no contact between CPS and TEL was not challenged, or that it was not part of the defence case that CPS and TEL had put their heads together to contaminate evidence. 
      
       
     56 Next, Mr. Byrne submitted that the reference to the common error in relation to Holsworthy gave no assistance to the jury as to how they might use it.  
      
       
     57 Finally, Mr. Byrne submitted that, in directing the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of TEL before they could consider it as evidence supporting the case of CPS, the trial judge did not explain that in deciding this matter they could not take into account the evidence of CPS.  
      
       
     58 In my opinion, dealing first with the last submission, this submission proceeds on a false assumption. In my opinion, it is plainly not necessary that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of TEL, considered alone, before they could take it into account as evidence supporting the case of CPS. That is contrary to the law concerning circumstantial evidence, as explained in Shepherd. The whole force of coincidence evidence is the co-existence of two or more pieces of evidence, so that satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt might come from this co-existence, whereas it could not come from any single piece of evidence considered on its own. Accordingly, any error in this direction was favourable to the appellant.  
      
       
     59 In so far as complaint is made concerning the direction about the Holsworthy error, that complaint must fail, in my opinion, because on no reasonable view could the mistake in relation to Holsworthy show contamination on the crucial similarities of assault at an army barracks and the location of that army barracks at Parramatta. 
      
       
     60 As regard the other two complaints, there is force in the submission that the directions are confusing. However, this is partly because the area is a difficult one, and partly in my opinion because of the way the case was conducted, in particular on behalf of the appellant. 
      
       
     61 As mentioned before, the coincidence in this case was not merely that there were alleged assaults by a teacher on a young pupil, of the same kind and at the same places, but also that two people independently gave evidence of such similar assaults. I have already expressed the view that the improbability of a coincidence on this matter is such that the only reasonable possibility is that both accounts have foundation in fact, or that both are the product of some other cause which they have in common, such as joint concoction or contamination.  
      
       
     62 However, while the particular requirements of ss.98 and 101 must be satisfied in the mind of the judge before such evidence can be admitted in a trial, those requirements do not have to be presented to the jury as something they must be concerned about. The jury can be permitted to use the evidence simply on the basis of the improbability of coincidence. However, by reason of s.95, they cannot use the evidence to suggest that an accused person has a tendency to act in a particular way, unless the judge has determined that the requirements of s.97 are satisfied. In this case, the judge did direct the jury that they could not use the evidence in question as propensity evidence. But even though the jury does not have to reconsider the questions arising under ss.98 and 101, in order for the jury to determine for itself the rational force of the evidence, the jury must both assess how improbable the relevant coincidence is, and assess the extent to which any other common cause (such as concoction or contamination) is excluded. The jury must do these things, in order to be able to properly use the evidence in coming to the ultimate conclusion as to whether the offence is proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     63 Because the jury must make an assessment of the extent to which some other common cause, such as concoction or contamination, is excluded, it would in my opinion be open to the Crown to lead before the jury the whole history of the generation of the two accounts, to the same extent as occurred in this case in the voir dire hearing. However, an accused might prefer that this not be done, because of the possible prejudicial effect of the detailed history, and of there being produced before the jury successive written statements prepared by relevant witnesses and notes taken by persons to whom they gave their accounts of the matter. (These documents, being admissible to rebut concoction or contamination, would also be admissible to prove facts intended to be asserted, unless an order to the contrary was made: see Evidence Act ss.60, 136.) So I think it is permissible for the Crown to do as it did in this case, that is, just call the witnesses to give their sworn accounts of the events, and to assert that they did not meet until after they made their first statements to the police, and leave it to the accused to explore the details of the generation of the stories, with the assistance of the material given in the voir dire hearing. In this case, the appellant did not in fact choose to go in detail in cross-examination to the evidence given on the voir dire concerning the generation of the stories. 
      
       
     64 Indeed, it is a striking feature of both these cases that the most powerful evidence rebutting concoction and contamination was not placed before the jury, namely the notes made in 1979 of TEL’s complaint to the school and CPS’s first statement to his solicitor made in 1996. (In TEL’s case, but not CPS’s case, there was evidence of a complaint made, in vaguer terms, by TEL to TEL’s brother at about the same time.) In my opinion, that documentary evidence was admissible in both cases; and although there was a danger of that evidence having prejudicial effect, its probative value greatly outweighed that danger. The objective records of complaints made respectively in February 1979 and in 1996, by two different persons with no contact with each other, both recording similar assaults on weekend visits to an army barracks with which the appellant was associated, were extremely probative of the absence of joint concoction or contamination. In my opinion, there was a considerable tactical advantage to the appellant in not having this material before the jury. 
      
       
     65 Because the question of how the history of the generation of the stories is to be dealt with before the jury is a matter very much bound up with the tactics of the trial, I consider it particularly significant to consider whether any complaint was made at the time concerning the way this aspect was left to the jury. There was in fact no complaint, and it was not suggested that the trial judge misrepresented the attitude of counsel for the accused in the directions which he gave. In my opinion, this both suggests that, having regard to the way the case was conducted, there was no substantial error unfavourable to the accused in the way the case was left to the jury, and it also raises the hurdle of r.4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules which would need to be overcome if the appellant was to succeed on this point. I am certainly not satisfied that there was injustice to the appellant arising from the way this matter was left to the jury, so that, even if I had thought there was error unfavourable to the accused in the directions, I would not grant leave for the appellant to rely on this ground.  
      
       
     66 I have been referring so far in my reasons on this point to the case of CPS. The same answer is arrived at, for the same reasons, in relation to the case of TEL.  
      
       
        
       LONGMAN DIRECTIONS 
       
     67 Mr. Byrne submitted that at the trial the appellant placed considerable reliance on his position of disadvantage, because of the delay in excess of twenty years before the time of the events the subject of the charges and the time when those charges were first levelled against the appellant. The only directions given by the trial judge in the trial concerning CPS were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         There is also one other matter that I bring to your attention, in which the law requires me to bring to your attention and it is a matter that has been also referred to you by counsel for the accused. And this is: that because of the delay between the time when these events are alleged to have occurred - that is in 1977 in relation to [CPS] and 1978 in relation to [TEL] - and the time of the allegations were brought to police notice, which occurred in 1998, following the police being brought into the matter with the police statement - do you recall the evidence of the police statements being made in January 1997? - following that delay of what is twenty-two or twenty-three years, or thereabouts, the accused has necessarily had difficulties in meeting those allegations. 
          
          
         The examples of the difficulties that were brought to your attention during the course of the trial and the closing addresses are, in a sense, the accused has had to conduct his defence in relation the allegations that he indecently assaulted [CPS] and [TEL] at the army barracks in 1977 and 1978. And now, after a period of years, they have been changes made in some respects to the barracks. An example, of course, is after twenty-two years there is a disputed issue as to what type of floor was on the drill hall; a dispute about what kind of windows were in the drill hall (painted or frosted); what was the situation in relation to an occasion, was it a parade day when the squadron was being presented to 100 to 150 people milling around; or was it an occasion when the squadrons were not there and there was only a skeleton staff, perhaps a dozen, or in some cases perhaps two or three. 
          
          
         I am just drawing your attention to these issues which have arisen in this trial, and the fact that you, the jury, are asked to reflect on and consider findings in relation to disputed issues that deal with matters that are some twenty-two or twenty-three years in the past. 
         
        
       
     68 The directions given in the trial concerning TEL were to somewhat similar effect, and are set out in the judgment of Greg James J. 
      
       
     69 Mr. Byrne submitted that these directions fell short in a number of respects: firstly, they were put as summarising points made by counsel for the accused, whereas the judge should have invested them with his own authority, and directed the jury firmly that these were matters they were bound to take into account; secondly, in that they failed to do justice to the difficulties facing the appellant, referring only to the relatively minor matter of changes that might have been made to such things as the physical features of the army barracks; and thirdly, in that they made no reference to the need for extreme caution before acting on the recollection of events that occurred in early childhood. Mr. Byrne submitted that the jury should have been warned that experience has shown that human recollection, and particularly recollection of events occurring in childhood, is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors, and that the likelihood of error increases with delay: cf. Longman v. The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 108. Mr. Byrne also relied on Crampton v. The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133 at par.45 and Doggett v. The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1290 at pars.41-55 and 131-142.  
      
       
     70 As mentioned earlier, in the case of CPS leave was sought to add two further grounds of appeal, first that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to amend the dates in one count of the indictment, and secondly in permitting further cross-examination of the appellant after a view of the army barracks at Parramatta. Mr. Byrne submitted that amendment of the indictment to alter the dates between which the offence was permitted could in the circumstances result in the alteration of the conduct of the evidence and deprive the appellant of a real chance of acquittal: Westerman v. The Queen (1991) 55 ACrimR 353, Regina v. VHP, NSWCCA, 7/7/97. As regards the other matter, the appellant was cross-examined after the view with a suggestion that a particular room observed in the view had been deliberately omitted from plans drawn by the appellant, and Mr. Byrne submitted that this was unfair.  
      
       
     71 In relation to the Longman ground, Mr. Smith submitted that this was a case where, no further direction having been sought, leave should not be granted to the appellant to rely on this matter. Mr. Smith relied on r.4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the omission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal. 
         
        
       
     72 In my opinion, this rule is relevant to the appeal on the Longman ground. As noted in Crampton at par.56, that rule was made under the power conferred by s.28 of the Criminal Appeal Act, and there is no suggestion that it is not properly made in exercise of that power. In Crampton itself, a New South Wales case, counsel for the appellant had submitted to the trial judge that her directions fell short of what was required by Longman, so that on this aspect there was no occasion to apply the rule. In Doggett, which was a Queensland case, it was noted by Kirby J at par.147 that this procedural hurdle did not exist. 
      
       
     73 On this matter also, it is significant that the notes of TEL’s 1979 complaint and CPS’s first statement were not before the jury in either case. Because of r.4, there is an onus on the appellant to satisfy this Court that justice requires leave to rely on matters not raised below; and this in turn generally requires the appellant to satisfy this Court that it was not by reason of tactical decisions reasonably made in the conduct of the trial that the matters were not raised below. 
      
       
     74 However, I accept that, leaving aside the point that no objection was taken and the associated need for leave under rule 4, the directions did not satisfy the requirements of Longman as amplified in Crampton and Doggett. I agree with Greg James J and Kirby J that the decision of the majority in Doggett leaves little room for exercise of discretion as to whether or not to give a Longman direction or as to its content. However, although I too found the analysis of Sully J in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60 extremely helpful, I do not agree that Longman directions must always comply with all six of the requirements that Sully J specified. That will be the case where a jury is being asked to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone, or where there is a reasonable possibility that they might do so. However, where as here there is substantial corroboration, it could be misleading to stress the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence alone.  
      
       
     75 This point was made by Gleeson CJ and McHugh J in their dissenting judgments in Doggett. The majority decision means that this consideration does not obviate the requirement of a Longman direction, but in my opinion it does not eliminate all discretion as to the form of the direction, in those cases where there is in fact substantial corroboration. In each of the present cases, for reasons I have given, the independent generation of two such similar stories was very substantial corroboration of each of them; and in my opinion the jury in each case was not being asked to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone, and there was no reasonable likelihood that they would do so.  
      
       
     76 In each of the present cases, in my opinion the Longman direction that was called for was a warning to the effect that the evidence of the complainant and the principal supporting witness had to be considered with great care, and with the appreciation that this evidence may give a misleading appearance of plausibility, because of the lapse of time and because of the consequential disadvantages faced by the appellant in testing it and meeting it. The disadvantages should have been explained as including the difficulty of testing the evidence of the witnesses where the details could not be effectively explored, whether because of understandable lack of detail in the appellant’s instructions, understandable lack of detail in the witnesses’ answers, inability to test those answers against circumstances that could have been the subject of effective independent checking, or all of these matters; and as also including the difficulties of bringing forward independent evidence which could contradict the account given by the Crown witnesses and support the account given by the appellant.  
      
       
     77 Perhaps also there should have been reference to the capacity of human beings to misremember events that occurred long ago, particularly events in childhood, and to be honestly convinced that something had happened when it did not.  
      
       
     78 I do not think there needed to be any reference to the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence alone; and in so far as any such reference had been made, it could properly have been combined with a reminder to the jury that they were not being asked to do that, and that they could properly take into account any improbability they saw in two persons independently coming forward with two similar accounts of assault by the appellant. In my opinion, there was no error in not referring to this danger; and even if there had been, leave under rule 4 should not be given, because plainly there were tactical reasons not to request such reference.  
      
       
     79 As regards the other matters the question is more difficult. I am not satisfied that the absence of a warning about the capacity to misremember was unrelated to the absence from evidence of the record of TEL’s 1979 complaint to the school. It is true, as pointed out by Greg James J, that if this direction had been sought, the Crown could not then have re-opened its case to tender this material; and it would seem that, unless the Crown pointed to some agreement based on the withholding of that material, the trial judge would have been obliged to give the direction. But just as this Court does not necessarily disregard material that was not before the jury because of an error by an accused’s counsel, I do not think it should necessarily disregard evidence available to the prosecution and admitted on the voir dire before the judge, which was not before the jury because of a tactical coup by the accused’s counsel or possibly an error by the prosecution. The question is one of substantial justice, in which, at least in cases where rule 4 or the proviso is concerned, this Court is not entirely limited to the application of technical rules. If one can take account of the evidence that was not before the jury, it can be said that such a direction, if unqualified, would have been misleading and unfair to the Crown, and unduly favourable to the appellant. I am not satisfied that the absence of a request for this direction was not a tactical matter associated with the absence of the evidence, and I would not grant rule 4 leave on this matter.  
      
       
     80 This leaves the deficiency in explaining the care with which the evidence needed to be considered, and the reasons for this. Had further directions to this effect been sought at the trial and not given, I think the appeal should have been allowed. However, further directions were not sought. Even in relation to this aspect, tactical considerations might have been involved. Additional directions on this matter could have produced further directions on the way in which the two main witnesses supported each other, which may in turn have detracted from the directions favourable to the appellant already given on this matter. I accept that Longman directions are extremely important, and that, as pointed out by Heydon JA in GPP at [60], leave under rule 4 is customarily given in such cases. But in my opinion this must be because in each case where leave is given the court is satisfied there has been a miscarriage of justice, at least in the sense that the appellant has been deprived of a reasonable chance of acquittal. And in my opinion, the reasonable chance that has been lost must be one which the appellant would have had in an acceptably fair trial. Perfection in directions is unattainable, and perfect fairness of trials is unattainable, by our system or any other system. What can be attained and what is required is a process and a result that is acceptably fair. On that standard, I am not satisfied that the appellant lost a reasonable chance of acquittal, and I would not give leave under rule 4.  
      
       
     81 In the case of CPS, in my opinion the decisions of the trial judge to permit the amendment of dates, and to allow further cross-examination after the view, were well within the discretion of the judge; and no appealable error is shown. 
      
       
        
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     82 For those reasons, in my opinion both appeals should be dismissed. 
      
       
     83 GREG JAMES J: I regret that I am unable to agree with Hodgson, JA. that the appeals should be dismissed. Generally, I agree with his Honour's views except in respect of the complaint concerning the effect of the delay (the ""Longman direction""). In my view the directions were critically inadequate and, having regard to the present state of the law, the appeals should be allowed, the sentences quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
     84 I also wish to add some observations of my own concerning the admission of the relationship evidence. 
      
       
        
       Relationship evidence 
       
     85 Hodgson JA. has set out in his judgment the background to the matters raised on appeal. There had been provided to the trial judge during the voir dire at the commencement of the trials, an extensive table referring, in the case of both boys, to many incidents sought to be admitted in evidence as tendency, coincidence or relationship evidence. The relationship evidence sought to be admitted was described by the trial judge as:- 
      
       
        
         
         … conduct by the accused not charged in the indictment but similar in relation to an indecent assault charged in order to rebut any suggestion of the offences being committed in isolation and to give the true and proper context to the allegations made by a particular complainant. 
         
        
       
     86 His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         I am satisfied if the mandatory directions to the jury are given in relation to the use of this evidence the probative value of the relationship evidence would not be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under s.137 or that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused or be misleading or confusing (to the jury) under s.135. 
          
          
         I am empowered under s.136 to limit the use to be made of this evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused. 
          
          
         I can foresee that if the Crown were to question a complainant in detail about similar misconduct to that charged in the indictment ie., to go into chapter and verse of when, where and how the similar misconduct occurred the accused would be unfairly prejudiced. He would not only have to meet the cases charged in the indictment but a host of other similar allegations of a substantive nature. 
          
          
         The proper course for the admission of this evidence is to limit the Crown to asking a complainant in effect: 'Apart from these matters charged in the indictment were there other occasions when you were dealt with by the accused in a similar way in relation to touching your genitalia?' and then go no further than that; then upon receiving an affirmative ask: 'If asked, could you give evidence of those occasions?' 
         
        
       
     87 There is a plenitude of authority both before and after the Evidence Act 1995 that such evidence as was sought to be admitted here is, for such purposes as the trial judge referred to, admissible, subject to the exercise of a discretion to exclude or limit the use of it. 
      
       
     88 By ruling as he did, the trial judge excluded explicit reference to the facts and detail of the evidence. For my part, I might not have permitted the second question, ""if asked, could you give evidence of those occasions"", even had I permitted the first, considering the matters I will turn to shortly. Also, for those considerations, I might have decided that, if all that could be allowed was the first question and an affirmative answer to it, the evidence would not have had such probative value, as to warrant admission, considering the possible prejudice, particularly in a trial such as this where a number of acts against different complainants were admitted either as directly probative of the charge or as coincidence evidence. 
      
       
     89 However, considering both questions and the answers to them, leads me to reflect that such answers to such questions either invite collateral disputes arising on any challenge to the allegation or, if left alone, suggest the truth of the general allegation is conceded even where the number, nature and extent of the activities to which the answers relate remain unspecified. The mandatory direction to which his Honour referred is of limited utility to protect against prejudice. In this case, his Honour sought to achieve that object by directing the jury as follows in the first trial:- 
      
       
        
         
         Apart from the three matters that are the subject of the charges in counts one, two and three at Parramatta, he gave evidence there were other occasions when he was indecently assaulted in like manner at the Parramatta Army Barracks. And in relation to count four, apart from the matter charged in the indictment, he gave evidence that there were other occasions when he was assaulted in that room where the stencilling equipment was in this like manner. 
          
          
         Now, I repeat what I said to you when that evidence was led: the accused is charged with the three offences that are set out in the indictment relating to the Parramatta Army Barracks, and it is your responsibility as a jury to decide whether the Crown case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the counts charging that offence at the army barracks, that the law in cases of this kind allows evidence to be given of what is described as relationship evidence in order to provide what the Crown contends to be the true context in which the offences were committed, to provide the true background in which it is alleged the offences were committed. 
          
          
         The background of the Crown case put to you is that these three offences at Parramatta and the offence at Mosman were not committed in isolation. They did not occur out of the blue as it were. If there was a background of similar incidents taking place so that the three incidents that you have to consider at Parramatta and the incident charged in relation to Mosman are not matters that occurred without any rhyme or reason, that occurred out of the blue sky, so to speak, with no rain about. Because the Crown submits that from the evidence of CPS, there was an ongoing relationship between the accused and CPS throughout the 1977 period as teacher and pupil at the school with daily contact form Monday to Friday, and the family were contacted at home and there is this background evidence of the person, such as the accused, and CPS having that relationship. 
          
          
         And it is only on that very limited basis, members of the jury, that this evidence is admissible. It is to provide the context or background that the Crown says these four offences were committed. And I emphasis (sic), as I told you at the time the evidence was given, it would be very wrong for you to reason; 'Oh, well, because CPS says other occasions occurred then that supports his evidence that these four matters charged in the indictment occurred'. You cannot use the evidence in this way. You cannot reason in that way. The evidence has only been led to remove any speculation in your mind about why it happened on those occasions and not others. 
          
          
         Members of the jury, I want to now take up with you a direction that I have already given to you in relation to the evidence of TEL and I gave it, you may recall very early in the trial when this evidence was led from TEL: namely that apart from the matters charged in the indictment, his evidence was that he had been indecently assaulted on other occasions than those charged. You will remember, members of the jury, that I told you by way of a warning that this evidence was only admitted on a very limited basis. It was limited on the basis of showing what the Crown contended was the true background, the true context in relation to the charges in the indictment; in other words to in the crown case avoid any speculation that might arise from the mind of the jury that well, in the background of an on going relationship of some 12 months in 1978 why did it happen so to speak out of the blue that on a particular occasion an assault was committed that would be a matter that could cast a shadow or a doubt over the reliability or credibility of TEL. It was only on that basis, members of the jury, that that evidence was admitted and I warned you at the time that it could only be used for that purpose. I also warned you at the time that it could not be used for the purpose of reasoning, 'Oh well, I might have a reasonable doubt about a particular charge in the indictment, but in view of the background that has been put to me that there were other occasions that I will find him guilty'. You will remember that I told you that that was a false and illogical process of reasoning. I told you that I would take the matter up again with you in my summing up as I am now doing because it is a most important matter for you to bear in mind and keep in the forefront of your mind. What you have to focus your attention on is whether or not the Crown has proved that these offences that are charged in the indictment were committed. You cannot substitute evidence that on other occasions TEL was alleging that he was indecently assaulted by TEL as proof of the matters charged in the indictment. You cannot do that. You must not do that nor can you. As I say, you cannot substitute that evidence for the evidence that relates to a particular charge nor can you use it to reason, 'Well, he is a person that on TEL's account has been doing it on other occasions. Then he has a tendency or propensity to commit offences of his kind. He is the kind of person that commits offences of this kind'. As I explained to you when I first gave you that direction: that is false and impermissible reasoning. You must not use that evidence in that way. It is a matter where it is led on the very limited basis that the Crown puts to you that this was the context, the background in which the Crown says these offences were committed in order to avoid any speculation in your mind as to why did they happen on those occasions and came out of the blue so to speak. So, then, members of the jury, your duty would be then, to take that on board for that limited reason but avoid any speculation on your part in that regard and you then confine and focus your attention on the evidence that bears on each particular charge and make up your minds in relation to that evidence whether or not you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt or not. 
         
        
       
     90 Notwithstanding those directions, in the form in which the evidence was given it showed little of the relationship as might have assisted the resolution of the matters left by his Honour to the jury but was capable of causing a deal of prejudice. It is hard to see how the jury could have applied these directions to evidence in this form. Should the evidence have been given in more detail there may have been even more prejudice, but if there was probative value it would probably have been higher. Other directions would then be appropriate 
      
       
     91 The problem becomes one of deciding what can be admitted, having regard to the directions that will have to be given. In any given case, the touchstone to be applied to decide to admit the evidence will be what the evidence reveals of the nature of the relationship as is necessary in the particular circumstances for a proper understanding of the context of the specific allegations so that those allegations themselves can be properly understood, when without the relationship evidence there is a real risk they might not. Where, as here, the relationship evidence is not tendency or coincidence evidence and is not directly probative of the acts founding the charges, the appropriateness of using it to prove a relationship which, although relevant, is hardly illustrated any more than it is by the other evidence, considering the form in which the relationship evidence is given, is doubtful. Since the directions need to show in a meaningful way how the evidence might be used and how it must not be used, the form of the evidence may make the task of so properly directing most difficult. Evidence in too general form, whether of tendency or relationship, is of limited if any use. 
      
       
     92 In Regina v. AN [2001] NSWCCA 372, Kirby, J. at 36 reviewed the purposes for which such evidence is properly admissible. In particular, at paragraphs 48 to 51, his Honour says:- 
      
       
        
         
         Further, some form of balance needs to be maintained between evidence relevant to the offence charged, and evidence introduced either as relationship evidence, or evidence of guilty passion (cf. Hunt, CJ. at CL. in  
         Beserick 
          (supra) at 522. In  
         Regina v. Bradley 
          (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 297, Shepherdson, J. said this (at 302):- 
          
           
           It is in my view not necessary that in every case the whole history of sexual activity between an accused person and the complainant be admitted in evidence. In some cases a trial judge may have to take care to limit that history to what is sufficient to enable the jury to set in its proper perspective and to understand the acts alleged to constitute a particular offence. In other words, in some cases the 'full story' … may have to be limited. … In a case such as the present where there are quite a large number of instances of carnal knowledge alleged against the appellant prior to the first of the acts of alleged indecent dealing the prejudice to an accused person may be so great that the sheer number and weight of those instances may well overbear the jury in its consideration of the evidence in each of the three charges and prevent the jury from considering that evidence impartially. 
           
          
          
         Finally, the generality of evidence concerning relationship, on one view, may render it inadmissible. In  
         Gipp v. The Queen 
          (supra) Gaudron, J. said this (at 112/113):- 
          
           
           General evidence of sexual abuse on occasions other than those charged does not have that special probative value which renders evidence admissible as 'similar fact' or 'propensity' evidence. And in this case, there was no feature of the kind present in  
           Regina v. Ball 
            [1911] AC 47 that made it directly relevant to the question whether the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. Thus, unless there was some subsidiary issue in the trial to which it was relevant, the evidence of general sexual abuse was not admissible.' 
           
          
          
         Callinan, J. was of a similar view (at 168/169). However, McHugh and Hayne, JJ. saw such evidence as unexceptional, often reflecting choices made by the advocate appearing for the accused. They said this (at 132):0- 
          
           
           The evidence tendered was general in its nature and, as the above passage, makes clear, was admitted for the limited purpose of making the circumstances of the specific offences more intelligible. It was admissible because it was evidence 'as to acts so closely and inextricably mixed up with history of the guilty act itself as to form part of one chain of relevant circumstances ( 
           Regina v. Bond 
            [1906] 2 KB 389 at 400; see  
           Wilson v. The Queen 
            (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 338, 343). Counsel might have objected to the generality of the evidence and insisted that the complainant should recite in detail, so far as she could, the times, places and manner of these sexual interferences. But he preferred – what seems to us to have been the better forensic choice – that the evidence of the sexual history should be given shortly and without prejudicial detail.' 
           
          
          
         Kirby, J. on this aspect, did not express a concluded view (cf. 73 ALJ 432 at 440-441). Powell, JA., in  
         Regina v. MM 
          [2000] NSWCCA 78, provided the following comment upon this decision (at para.46):- 
          
           
           Although in the course of their separate judgments in  
           Gipp v. The Queen 
            (1998) 194 CLR 106, Gaudron, J. at 111-113 and Callinan, J. at 168-169 expressed the view that general evidence of sexual abuse on occasions other than those charged is, in the absence of conduct on the pat of the defence which raises an issue to which prior abuse is relevant, not admissible unless it has a special probative value which renders to admissible as propensity evidence, that view does not appear yet to command a majority in the High Court.' 
           
          
         
        
       
     93 In that case, I said at paragraphs 4-7:- 
      
       
        
         
         The exception to which I have referred involves the question of the reception into evidence of the material of sexual activity extraneous to each particular charge as relationship evidence. 
          
          
         Whilst I consider his Honour's discussion of the questions involved most valuable, I find difficulty in accepting that in this case, if this material were to be admitted as relationship evidence and the jury to be directed to use it only as evidence of relationship in accordance with the direction required by application of the principles in  
         Regina v. MM 
          [2000] NSWCCA 78, they would be able in reality to act in accordance with that direction. 
          
          
         These considerations might merit reconsideration of the concepts of ""relationship"", ""context"", guilty passion"" and such like in the light of the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 as they might apply to cases similar to this one but such considerations should await a suitable case. 
          
          
         In my view, it is not necessary to decide this appeal that the evidence be analysed to consider its possible use as relationship evidence. The appeal should be upheld on the limited basis I have indicated."" 
         
        
       
     94 I have regard to what was said in AN (supra). For my part I see a real risk that evidence of this kind adduced in this way will be highly prejudicial, colouring the evidence directly probative of guilt, unable to be tested because of its generality and of little probative value in itself. A complainant, by giving such evidence, might merely support his or her own credibility (see s.102 of the Evidence Act 1995 and the judgment of Gaudron, J. in HG v. The Queen (1999) 160 ALR 554 at paragraph 71) rather than give evidence of substantial probative value (see s.103(1)). Further, there is the complication that where such evidence raises collateral issues an accused cannot be cross-examined on them without leave (s.104). 
      
       
     95 To challenge, at all, evidence led in such a general form would almost inevitably raise the details the party tendering the evidence has not led and refrained or been restrained from leading, as here, because of the inevitable prejudice. A challenge may have the effect of broadening or diverting the contest and obscuring any answer to the precise charges. 
      
       
     96 The admission of the evidence is supported on two bases, one, ""to rebut any suggestion of the offences being committed in isolation"" and, two, ""to give the true and proper context"". The first is often artificial, particularly where there are a number of charges, as no such challenge would be made and both are somewhat affected by an assumption productive of a possible circularity of reasoning that such a context supports the truthfulness and acceptability of the account of the directly probative material. 
      
       
     97 All of the above would mind me to consider that such evidence would more rarely than is often the case be admitted. But the decision in the instant case was a matter for the trial judge in his appreciation of the facts and although I might not have done as he did, I am unable to conclude he fell into legal error when I apply the appropriate test for appellant review of a trial judge's decision. I cannot detect such an effect on this trial in the upshot as would show a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
        
       The ""Longman"" directions 
       
     98 As to the Longman direction, Hodgson, JA. has set out the direction given in the first trial. That given in the second trial was as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         There is one further direction that I give you in relation to this matter and that is this, that because of the delay between the time when these events are alleged to have occurred, that is in 1978, and the time when these allegations were brought to this notice, it necessarily had difficulty in meeting these allegations. 
          
          
         That is a matter, members of the jury, that I am bound under the law to bring to your attention and to remind you of those difficulties. 
          
          
         It is a matter that you should take into consideration, that is the prejudice that has been suffered by the accused in meeting these claims, meeting these allegations, that his ability to recall and gather evidence pointing to his innocence has been adversely affected. 
          
          
         That is a matter for you to consider. It is a matter for you to take into account, as I say, that he has been placed in a difficult situation, now having to answer allegations relating to 1978. 
          
          
         Now the words that the accused has been placed in a situation of hardship in adequately and properly preparing his defence by reason of that delay by reason of the fact that the matters that might have been fresh in the memory in 1978 might well have faded from memory. And there may be other matters that could have been attended to but were not. 
          
          
         And in this case, you heard from Mr. Webb, counsel for the accused, refer to the difficulties in relation to a number of disputed issues such as was there a stencilling room in the Mosman Prep School in 1978 on the first floor. 
          
          
         And the difficulty in the year 2000 of ascertaining what the position was. Did he have a mustardy coloured four door sedan in 1978, or did he not. Was the school playing cricket on Saturday at Primrose Park or not. And there are other matters that you have been told about, and they are matters, members of the jury, that you should reflect on and consider in relation to the fact that there has been an absence of complaints. 
         
        
       
     99 Both directions require the jury to consider the accused's difficulty in answering the allegations by way of adequately and properly preparing his defence. In each case reference is made, as far as that difficulty is concerned, to the effect of delay on the accused's ability to ascertain or recall what at the time of the allegations were the surrounding circumstances such as the condition of the stencilling room at the school or the barrack's geography. 
      
       
     100 In neither case did the trial judge make reference to the effect of the delay on the accused's ability to test and challenge the evidence in the Crown case by cross-examination such as to reveal any deficits that might relate to the credibility of the complainants. It is this inability which, having regard to the onus and standard of proof in a criminal trial, is probably the most important effect of the delay. So far as the usual formulation of a Longman direction goes, which requires scrutiny of the Crown evidence with caution (sometimes extreme caution), it reflects the necessity for the jury to be given instruction concerning the special consideration with which it must treat the evidence in cases delayed so long in the context of the discharge of their function, to determine guilt having regard to the onus and standard of proof.101 In Hodgson, JA.'s view, the applicant is precluded by Rule 4 from complaint about the inadequacies of these directions unless it is shown that the failure to complain at trial was not due to a tactical decision, particularly since the notes of TEL's 1979 complaint and CPS' first statement were not before the jury. On the material before us, I am unable to see that the failure to seek a re-direction might relate to the absence from the evidence of those documents or bear some tactical relationship to their absence. The evidence had closed and could hardly have been re-opened because of an application for a re-direction to properly comply with the law applicable to the evidence as it stood. 
      
       
     102 In my view, both directions were inadequate as failing to require the jury to consider the effects of the delay on the ability to test the Crown case, particularly having regard to the application of the principles in Regina v. Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79; Regina v. Crampton (2000) 75 ALJR 133; Regina v. Doggett (2001) 75 ALJR 1290; by this court in Regina v. GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493 and Regina v. BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60. In these cases the purpose, history and case law concerning the various forms of direction in the case of delay and the consequences of the omission of an appropriate direction are discussed. 
      
       
     103 In these decisions, it is noted that the law and practice in criminal matters on this topic is presently the subject of much difficulty and disagreement. It may well be that the topic is in need of re-consideration to ensure that any necessity for warning or direction accords with established fundamental principles. I will therefore turn to the extensive discussion in those latter two cases. 
      
       
     104 In GPP (supra), Wood, CJ. at CL. and Carruthers, AJ. agreed with Heydon, JA., who concluded that a direction which merely referred to a delay in complaint and the effect of time on memory was inadequate to deal with the loss of the means of testing the complainant's allegations. At paragraphs 49-51 he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         It follows from the majority opinions in  
         Doggett v. R. 
          that delay coupled with forensic disadvantage is sufficient to create an obligation to give a  
         Longman 
          warning, and it follows from the majority opinions in  
         Crampton v. R. 
          together with that if Kirby, J. in  
         Doggett v. R. 
         , that delay capable of creating the phenomena described by Deane and McHugh, JJ. in  
         Longman v. R. 
          is also sufficient. 
          
          
         Gleeson, CJ. and McHugh, J. dissented in  
         Doggett v. R. 
          on the ground that the accused's counsel had not asked for any warning, and that to have done so would have caused the jury to concentrate on the existence of the corroboration in a manner injurious to the accused's interests. (There is nothing far-fetched about this suggestion: it was for that very reason that counsel asked for the warning not to be given in  
         R. v. Arundell 
          [1999] 2 VR 228.) Further, Gleeson, CJ. said that to warn about the lack of safety in convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant would have been pointless since it was corroborated. McHugh, J. also said that it was crucial to  
         Longman v. R. 
          that the jury were being asked to convict on uncorroborated evidence of events 20 or 25 years earlier while the complainant, then a young child, was asleep or waking from sleep. The majority statement in  
         Longman v. R. 
          about the lost forensic opportunities available to the accused had to be read in the light of the general circumstances of the case and in any event were obvious to juries.  
         Crampton v. R. 
          was in the same category. 
          
          
         It is obvious that there are sharp divisions within the High Court about  
         Longman 
          warnings. Whatever the merits of the opinions of Gleeson, CJ. and McHugh, J., they are dissenting opinions. 
         
        
       
     105 At paragraph 57 he said:- 
      
       
        
         
         However, it is impossible to escape from the conclusion that if delay causes either forensic prejudice to the accused in the particular circumstances, or risks of the type described by Deane and McHugh, JJ. in  
         Longman v. R. 
         , a warning must be given. The passages which support that conclusion cannot be read down or evaded. 
         
        
       
     106 The absence of an application for re-direction was referred to at paragraph 60:- 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown's first point in answer was that counsel for the appellant did not seek at the trial the direction which it is now said should have been given, and that leave is required under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to advance these grounds. Counsel's failure is regrettable, but if the appellant's criticisms are sound, they are, in the light of the High Court authorities, sufficiently important for leave to be given, as it customarily is by this court in cases concerning  
         Longman  
         directions. 
         
        
       
     107 As to the content of the warning, his Honour said at paragraph 70:- 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown submitted that the trial judge emphasised the weakness in the complainant's evidence more substantially than the appellant had submitted. That is true. But what the  
         Longman-Crampton-Doggett 
          line of cases requires is not only a warning about the inherent weakness of the complainant's evidence, but also a warning about the difficulty which delay has caused the accused in trying to deal with the allegations. 
         
        
       
     108 Further, at paragraph 76:- 
      
       
        
         
         The trial judge in the present case said nothing specific about the difficulties which delay might have caused to the defence as distinct from the impact of delay on recollection. He said less than the trial judge did in  
         Crampton v. R. 
          The upholding of the relevant grounds of appeal in that appeal has the consequence that so far as there was a warning here, it was inadequate. 
         
        
       
     109 As to the application of the proviso, his Honour held:- 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown contended that the proviso to s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied, that is, that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that 'no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred'. 
          
          
         The application of the proviso depends on the error not being one which is so fundamental as to have caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all, and on the conviction being 'inevitable', so that the appellant can be said not to have lost a chance which was fairly open to him to have been acquitted. See  
         Glennon v. R. 
          (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712. This error is not fundamental in the sense just described. Attention must therefore be directed to the strength of the Crown case. The Crown submitted that it was high. The victim's story was inherently credible and coherent. Her failure to complain until she complained to her husband was understandable. The fact that she complained to him when she did was understandable. There was some evidence confirming the complainant's evidence, though not strongly. Though the defence called witnesses, their performance may have strengthened the Crown case partly because they were seen to be trying too hard and partly because they contradicted each other. 
          
          
         The appellant's submission that the Crown case was weak is baseless. But once it is assumed, as it must be, that the prejudicial effect of delay on the forensic position of the appellant was not obvious to the jury, unless it had been explained to them, the warning which was not given could have caused them to experience a reasonable doubt. 
          
          
         Hence the proviso cannot be applied. 
         
        
       
     110 A new trial was ordered. 
      
       
     111 I share the disquiet expressed by the members of the bench in BWT (supra) as to what should be said by way of an appropriate direction. In BWT (supra), Sully, J., with whom Wood, CJ. at CL. and Dowd, J. agreed said:- 
      
       
        
         
         I have come, based upon the foregoing survey of curial authority, to the following conclusions:- 
          
         [1] The proposition advanced by Gleeson CJ in  
         Doggett v The Queen 
          to the effect that the decision in  
         Longman 
          “is not authority for the proposition that, in any case where there has been substantial delay in complaining of a sexual offence, it is, on that account alone, imperative to give a warning that it would be ‘dangerous’ of ‘unsafe’ to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant”, is, as I respectfully think, plainly correct on a fair reading of what was actually said in the joint judgment in  
         Longman 
          itself.  
          
          
           
           Notwithstanding that some support is given to Gleeson CJ’s proposition by the relevant parts of the judgment of McHugh J in Doggett, I think that the conclusion is unavoidable that, as matters currently stand, all five of the remaining Justices of the High Court do not accept the Chief Justice’s proposition.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [2] It seems to be a fair inference from the various statements of principle of those five Justices of the Court that they would all accept, at least to some extent, a measure of discretionary flexibility on the part of a trial Judge who is required to give a  
         Longman 
          direction.  
         
        
        
         
          It seems to me, however, that the majority Justices regard that margin of discretion as being a very narrow one. It seems to be their Honours’ position that such a residual discretion is available for the purpose of strengthening what I might describe as the basic  
         Longman  
          direction; but that it is not available so as to water the basic direction down in any way. 
         
        
        
         
         [3] It seems to me to be a reasonable inference from what their Honours have said that all the current Justices of the High Court, excepting the Chief Justice and McHugh J, take the basic position that in any criminal trial a feature of which is substantial delay in complaint of alleged sexual offences then charged against the particular accused, a  
         Longman  
         direction  
         must  
         be given. Not only  
         must  
         the direction be given; but it  
         must 
          be cast in a form that manifests, and is seen plainly to manifest, certain characteristics which one can draw, as follows, from the various statements of principle in  
         Longman 
          itself and in the subsequent decisions in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
         : 
          
          (a) The direction must be cast in the form of a  
         warning 
         . Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
         comment 
         , or even of a  
         caution 
          will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law.  
         
        
        
         
          It seems to me to follow that any trial Judge who is framing a  
         Longman 
          direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
         warning 
         .  
         
        
        
         
          (b) That which is to be warned against is, to return to the majority judgment in  
         Longman 
          itself: “that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of [the particular period relevant in the particular trial], it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, was satisfied of its truth and accuracy”. 
         
        
        
         
          The approach of the majority Justices in both  
         Crampton 
          and  
         Doggett 
          seems to me to entail that a trial Judge who is framing a  
         Longman 
          direction must ensure that the final form of the direction to the jury covers in terms the following propositions:  
         first 
         , that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested;  
         secondly 
         , that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone;  
         thirdly 
         , that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy;  
         fourthly 
         , that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care;  
         fifthly 
         , that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant’s evidence; and  
         sixthly 
         , that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction. 
         
        
        
         
          (c) Not only must the substance of the warning be carefully and correctly focused, but the form of the warning, also, must be carefully and correctly framed.  
         
        
        
         
          The form of the warning must be such as bears unmistakably the imprint of the Court’s own authority. It must be made clear that the foundation of that authoritative warning of the Court itself is the accumulated experience of the Courts in dealing with cases characterised by substantial delay in the making of complaint about alleged sexual offences. It will be unwise, and more probably than not will be held upon appellate review to have been erroneous, to frame the warning in a way which suggests that what is being said conveys in essence nothing more than the common sense of the jurors would in any event have indicated. A ready example of that will be found in the trial directions in  
         Crampton 
         .  
         
        
        
         
          (d) In framing the substance of a  
         Longman 
          direction, a Judge must keep in mind not only the guidance given by the joint judgment in  
         Longman 
          itself, but also the additional considerations to which reference was made in their respective judgments by Deane J and McHugh J.  
         
        
        
         
          (e) The decision in  
         Doggett 
          will mean, in practical terms, that the framing of a satisfactory  
         Longman 
          direction will be a much more fraught and difficult experience in a case where the particular complainant’s evidence does not stand entirely alone, but is supported, whether patchily or not, by some other evidence that is capable of being regarded reasonably as corroborative evidence. 
         
        
        
         
          Those additional difficulties are pointed out clearly and compellingly, if I may respectfully say so, in the following portion of the judgment of Gleeson CJ in  
         Doggett 
         , (see paragraph [9]): 
          
           
            
             
              
               
               If, by a Longman warning is meant a warning that it was unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant, in the circumstances of this case such a warning, to be of practical assistance to the jury, would have required the trial judge to go into the matter of corroboration, to direct the attention of the jury to the evidence capable of being regarded as corroborative and to explain its possible significance. Why would defence counsel invite that? As far as he was concerned, the less said about corroboration the better. 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          The majority Justices, that is to say Gaudron and Callinan JJ in their Honours’ joint judgment and Kirby J in his Honour’s separate judgment, do not go so far as to say that a  
         Longman  
         direction will always be required notwithstanding that there is evidence capable of corroborating, whether in whole or in part, the particular complainant’s own evidence. What their Honours do make plain, is that the availability of such corroborative evidence cannot,  
         of itself 
         , obviate the need for a proper  
         Longman  
          direction. What their Honours appear to be saying is that the availability of such corroborative evidence will require the particular trial Judge to make a painstaking analysis of the way in which, of the extent to which, and of the particular points in connection with which, the corroborative material is effective; and then to decide whether the resulting state of affairs leaves open, notwithstanding the corroboration, such forensic disadvantage as to call for the giving of a  
         Longman 
          direction. 
         
        
        
         
          (f) The initial trigger for any  
         Longman 
          direction is the passage of time between the alleged offence and first complaint. No doubt, and as Kirby J observes in  
         Doggett 
         ,  
         “(t)he criterion for the provision of a warning as stated in  
         Longman 
          is not mathematically precise” 
         . His Honour goes on to say that  
         “in a case involving a comparatively short interval between the alleged offence and a subsequent complaint to family members or to authorities, a warning  
         might not be 
          necessary” 
         . (emphasis added) His Honour refers in a footnote to  
         Crofts 
         , where the delay between the first alleged offence and complaint was about six years, although there had been offences allegedly continuing until about six months before complaint; and  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439, where there was a delay in the order of four years between offence and complaint. 
         
        
        
         
          On these particular points, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in the judgments variously delivered by their Honours in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
         , are not, I think, as precise as is Kirby J. I think, nevertheless, that the prudent inference to be drawn from what their Honours have variously said in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
          is that they would support, at least generally, the propositions advanced by Kirby J. 
         
        
        
         
          It is, I think, clear enough that a delay in the order of 20 years would require, imperatively in the view of the current majority opinion in the High Court, a  
         Longman 
          direction, and a strong one at that. What is not clear is whether there is any, and if so what, time lapse that would be generally regarded by current majority opinion in the High Court as not calling for the giving of a  
         Longman  
          direction. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             While that state of affairs continues, it seems to me that the only prudent approach of a trial Judge is one that regards any delay between offence and complaint as sufficient to raise for consideration the need for a  
             Longman 
              direction. That consideration should concentrate upon two related factors, namely, the actual lapse of time involved in the particular case; and the actual risk of relevant forensic disadvantage in the particular case. It seems to me that, as matters stand, a trial Judge would be well advised to give a  
             Longman 
              direction unless it is possible to conclude reasonably:  
             first 
             , that the particular time lapse is so small that any reasonable mind would regard it as, in context, trifling;  
             and 
               
             secondly 
             , that the risk of relevant forensic disadvantage would be seen by any reasonable mind as, (to borrow from Mason J in  
             Wyong Shire Council v Shirt  
             1980) 
               
             146 CLR 40 at 47),  
             “far-fetched or fanciful”.  
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [4] It is a nice question of academic jurisprudence whether the substantive effect of the judgments in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
          overrules the propositions articulated by Spigelman CJ in  
         Johnston 
         . The two High Court decisions do not themselves shed any direct light on that question. It is, I think, sufficient to say that, as I respectfully think, Spigelman CJ’s propositions in  
         Johnston 
          should be approached and applied with some caution, in as much as those propositions seem to me, with respect, to entail a degree, (and, I might add, in my opinion a wholly justifiable and desirable degree), of judicial flexibility which does not sit comfortably with what seems to have become the settled majority view in the High Court.  
         
        
        
         
         In endeavouring to apply the foregoing discussion, and the principles which are in my opinion correctly to be derived from it, to the directions actually given in the present case by the learned trial Judge, I have kept in mind the practical realities that confronted his Honour on the relevant occasion. His Honour was sitting in a country circuit town, with all that is thereby entailed in terms of limited resources. His Honour was trying a matter, the basic allegations in which were clear and straightforward. His Honour got virtually no assistance from the Bar table in connection with the need for any, and if so what,  
         Longman 
          direction. His Honour was burdened, of course, with the advice given over many years, and both by the High Court and by variously constituted Benches of this Court, to the effect that trial Judges should not be unduly technical or complicated in charging a jury, but should prefer always to express themselves simply and clearly. The directions given in fact by his Honour to the jury seem to me, if I may respectfully say so, to have been both practical and sensible, having regard to the way in which the comparatively short trial had been conducted both by the Crown and by the defence; and to the way in which the issues for trial had been crystallised as between the Crown and the defence.  
         
        
        
         
         I find it, if I may presume to say so frankly, unpalatable to have to say in such a context that the directions given to the jury do not meet the requirements of the current law in connection with the so-called  
         Longman 
          direction. But, unpalatable or not, I have come to the conclusion that there is no way in which the brief and temperate directions given by his Honour to the particular jury can be accommodated to the requirements established, not only by  
         Longman 
          itself, but by the subsequent decisions in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
         . 
         
        
       
     112 Although he noted:- 
      
       
        
         
         … it cannot be denied that the jury was given a clear warning of the need to scrutinise with care the evidence of the complainant before accepting it as, not only honest, but also reliable. The jury must be presumed both to have understood, and to have given effect to those directions. 
         
        
       
     113 His Honour reached the following view on the facts of that case, a view which might well be applied to this:- 
      
       
        
         
         In those circumstances, I do not see any present justification for this Court’s now setting aside the verdict of the jury upon the basis that this Court is convinced that the jury, acting reasonably, ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt as charged of the appellant. 
         
        
       
     114 But, his Honour concluded, having regard to the law as it stands requiring a Longman direction, the appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
     115 His Honour then made, in an addendum to his judgment, a number of observations with which I agree:- 
      
       
        
         
         In  
         CSR Limited & Anor v Bouwhuis  
         (unreported; Court of Appeal; 23 August 1991), Samuels JA observed: 
          
           
           The role of the judicial dissenter, after the initial protest has been made, is necessarily to maintain a silent vigil in the wings of jurisprudential history. It may remain solitary, or it may culminate in a summons to centre stage. But it does not involve denigrating the current script or booing the players. 
           
          
          
         I do not intend in what follows either to denigrate the current script or to boo the players. I wish, rather and simply, and speaking as one who is called upon to preside regularly over criminal trials with a jury, to draw attention to some practical results for trial Judges of the matters which it has been necessary to discuss in the context of the present particular appeal.  
          
          
         In this State a Judge who is presiding at a criminal trial comes to the summing-up burdened with a great deal of appellate judicial advice as to how the summing-up should be framed. Three particular examples will make the point. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         It seems to me, if I may say so with unfeigned respect, that the combined effect of the decisions in  
         Longman 
         , in  
         Crampton  
          and in  
         Doggett 
          makes it, if not quite impossible, at least extremely and unnecessarily difficult for a conscientious trial Judge when directing a jury, to give dutiful effect, as of course he must do, to the requirements of those decisions, while simultaneously giving effect to the requirement that he be succinct, simple and clear. 
          
          
         Suppose that the case is one like  
         Doggett 
          itself, that is to say, a case in which there is some, albeit perhaps patchy, corroboration of at least some parts of the complainant’s own evidence. Suppose that counsel for the accused is alive to the forensic problems that are described by Gleeson CJ in paragraph [9] of his Honour’s judgment in  
         Doggett 
         . Suppose that counsel for the accused, mindful of that forensic minefield, does not ask for a  
         Longman  
         direction; or, indeed, asks that no such direction be given. Where, it might reasonably be asked, does that leave the trial Judge? There are, obviously I should have thought, only two practical choices. One is to accede to the request that there be no  
         Longman 
          direction. The other is to over-ride that request in the spirit of  
         Pemble v The Queen 
          (1971) 124 CLR 107. If the Judge takes the former course, the current state of the law makes it overwhelmingly probable that any resulting conviction will be upset on appeal. If the Judge takes the  
         Pemble  
         approach, then he will find himself mired inevitably in the very problems of which Gleeson CJ gives warning in the paragraph [9] to which I have earlier referred; and there is raised thereby the prospect that a requirement intended to protect the accused turns out to have in fact exactly the opposite practical result. 
          
          
         Suppose, to take another practical possibility, that the trial Judge gives a  
         Longman 
          direction. Suppose that the jury, after retirement to consider its verdict, sends in a note asking the trial Judge whether there is any, and if so what, evidence indicative of any practical difficulty or difficulties in fact encountered by the particular accused by reason of the effluxion of time between the time of the alleged offence and the time of complaint. And suppose that, as in the present particular case, there is in truth not a scintilla of evidence of any such practical forensic disadvantage having been suffered by the particular accused. What, then, is the trial Judge to do? If he tells the jury the simple truth, it is likely to be held that he has thereby destroyed the efficacy of the  
         Longman 
          warning. If he tells the jury that it is no concern of theirs to enquire whether or not there is any such particular evidence; but that they are to proceed upon the simple basis that the experience of the Courts suggests that there has been some such forensic disadvantage, whether or not the particular accused has claimed it, or given evidence of it, the practical likelihood is that the jury will reason that, since it is not possible to see in any concrete way evidence of actual forensic disadvantage, there is no good reason why, as a matter of fact, it should be found that there has been any. In which event the apparent lack in the particular case of any discernible factual underpinning for the  
         Longman 
          direction produces, once again, the result that an intended protection for the accused ceases to afford the accused any protection, and tends rather to have the opposite effect in practice. 
          
          
         And, quite apart from the matters raised in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, what guidance, it might fairly be asked by a trial Judge, does the current state of the law give as to the practical definition of the sort of time lapse which justifies, in a real sense, the giving at all of a  
         Longman 
          direction. It is, I should think, simple enough for any trial Judge to grasp the concept, articulated by Kirby J in  
         Doggett 
         , that:  
         “(t)he criterion for the provision of a warning as stated in  
         Longman 
          is not mathematically precise” 
         . But what exactly, the trial Judge might find himself wondering, is meant by the proposition that  
         “in a case involving a comparatively short interval between the alleged offence and a subsequent complaint to family members or to authorities, a warning  
         might not be 
          necessary” 
          (emphasis added)? Even after some definition has been given to the fluid concept of  
         “a comparatively short interval” 
         , it remains necessary to consider, granted that there has been such a short interval, not whether a  
         Longman 
          direction might or might not be required, but whether such a direction is or is not required. If the Judge approaches that conundrum upon the basis that the determining consideration is the presence of an unacceptable risk of unfairly prejudicial forensic disadvantage, then either the Judge assumes as a matter of law, and notwithstanding the complete absence of relevant evidence, that there has been some such forensic disadvantage; or the Judge refuses to give the direction unless there is in hand at least some credible evidence from which there may be drawn a reasonable inference that there has been, in a sense that is not far-fetched or fanciful, relevant forensic disadvantage. Either way, the answer gives rise, as I have attempted to demonstrate in the preceding paragraphs, to yet further practical problems. 
          
          
         There is one additional matter worthy of present consideration. A commonsense understanding of the real world suggests that a jury which is given a  
         Longman 
          direction in the form now apparently required, is likely to reason that the trial judge, although he has stressed repeatedly that it is not for him to tell the jury how the facts should be found, is in fact sending a none-too-subtly coded indication to the jury that the dangers of convicting are such that the jury ought to return a verdict of not guilty. 
         
        
       
     116 Wood, CJ. at CL. added some observations of his own and said, dealing with passages in Longman (supra), Doggett (supra) and Crampton (supra):- 
      
       
        
         
         These passages have been taken up, so it seems to me, as requiring that an instruction in equally positive terms, be given in every case involving a substantial delay, irrespective of whether or not there is any evidence, or basis beyond suspicion, that the absence of contemporaneity between the alleged offence and complaint, or trial has  
         in fact 
          (not ‘might have’) denied to the accused a proper opportunity to meet the charge or charges brought: see for example  
         R v Roddom  
          (2001) NSWCCA 168,  
         R v GJH 
          (2001) NSWCCA 128 and  
         R v Roberts 
          (2001) NSWCCA 163. 
          
          
         Put another way, the effect of these decisions has been to give rise to an irrebuttable presumption that the delay  
         has 
          prevented the accused from adequately testing and meeting the complainant’s evidence; and that, as a consequence, the jury must be given a warning to that effect irrespective of whether or not the accused was in fact prejudiced in this way. 
         
        
       
     117 His Honour identified the reasoning in those decisions as deriving the direction from the onus and standard of proof when he reflected on the form of the direction usually given and called for a re-consideration of the form of the warning:- 
      
       
        
         
         The difficulty which I have with this proposition is that it elevates the presumption of innocence, which must be preserved at all costs, to an assumption that the accused was  
         in fact 
          innocent, and that he or she might have called relevant evidence, or cross examined the complainant in a way that would have rebutted the prosecution case, had there been a contemporaneity between the alleged offence and the complaint or charge. That consideration loses all of its force if, in fact, the accused  
         did commit 
          the offence. In that event there would have been no evidence available of a positive kind, relating for example to the existence or ownership of the premises, or of a motor vehicle or other item, associated with the offence charged, or going to establish an alibi for the relevant occasion, no matter how contemporaneous the complaint or charge was with the offence. 
          
          
         I do not seek by these observations to question the common sense considerations that delay can, and in many cases will, occasion difficulty to an accused who may have lost an opportunity to investigate whether a complaint of sexual misconduct could, or could not, have occurred at those places, or within the time frames alleged and, even more importantly, to gather physical evidence in the form of records, or evidence from other witnesses that would support such a proposition. The simple fact is that records can be lost or mislaid, and the memory of potential witnesses may dim, or they may not be capable of being found. 
          
          
         For these reasons, as Spigelman CJ noted in  
         R v Johnston 
          (1998) 45 NSWLR 362, in sexual assault cases which commonly turn upon a direct conflict or word against word, between a complainant and an accused, and where there is no independent verification of whether the event occurred, or of whether it was consensual, the contextual details of the alleged conduct will often prove to be ” 
         of definitive significance 
         ” (at p 370). 
          
          
         These are matters which can and should properly be placed before a jury, as relevant to its assessment of the prosecution case. My concern lies more with the unequivocal nature of a  
         warning 
         , which must be given by a trial judge who does not himself or herself know where the truth lies, that the accused  
         was unable 
          to adequately test and meet the prosecution case.  
          
          
         If in fact the accused did commit the offence charged, any such warning or direction would be misleading if not positively untrue. A similar consideration would apply if, in fact, the accused was not prejudiced, being able, in the particular circumstances of the case, for example to call positive and objective evidence in rebuttal, or where the absence of contemporaneity did not in any way deprive him or her of such an opportunity. 
          
          
         The latter circumstance might arise, for example, where the complaint related to a time and place where the accused was in fact living alone with the complainant, and in circumstances where, no matter what inquiries were made, the case became one of word against word, such that rebuttal evidence could never have been obtained. 
          
          
         I have no difficulty with the decision in  
         Longman 
         , or with the subsequent decisions, if understood as decisions on their own facts, that is, as cases where the delay was of such an inordinate degree that it was impossible for an accused even to begin to investigate the circumstances alleged. Nor do I have any problems with the warning now required, where there is evidence, or good reason to suppose positively, that the accused  
         has been 
          prejudiced. 
          
          
         Otherwise, I would respectfully raise for consideration, whether some modification should be made to the warning which, it seems to me, must now be given, in invariable and emphatic terms, of the fact of prejudice. In that regard I do not consider it unimportant that, in the various passages cited, the reasons given for the warning have at times spoken in terms of the possibility, rather than the fact, of prejudice, as underpinning it (see also in this regard the observations of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 454 to 455.  
          
          
         Nor do I consider it irrelevant that the impact of delay is double edged, since it is just as likely to occasion practical difficulty for the prosecution in pinning down times and places, and in gathering relevant witnesses. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         For the reasons identified in  
         Regina v GPP  
         ([2001] NSWCCA 493), and by Sully J in this appeal, notwithstanding the number of times that the  
         Longman  
         direction has been considered, there still is a sharp division in the High Court (following  
         Doggett v The Queen 
         ) as to the circumstances when, and the terms in which, the necessary warning should be given. Additionally, there is the concern upon which I have focused concerning whether or not the warning should be given in terms that the appellant  
         has been 
          forensically disadvantaged on the one hand, or  
         might have been 
          so disadvantaged, on the other hand.  
          
          
         It needs to be borne in mind that the direction presently under consideration is but one of a multitude of directions which now fall to be considered by a trial judge faced with the task of summing up to a jury in a sexual assault case. They include:- 
          
         (a) the  
         Murray 
          direction ( 
         R v Murray 
          (1987) 11 NSWLR 12) to the effect that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness “ 
         must be scrutinized with great care 
         ” before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; 
          
         (b) The  
         Longman 
           
         direction 
          (as reinforced in  
         Crampton  
         and  
          Doggett 
         ), that by reason of delay, it would be “ 
         unsafe or dangerous 
         ” to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant alone, unless the jury scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. 
          
         (c) The  
         Crofts 
          direction ( 
         Crofts v The Queen 
          (1996) 186 CLR 427), if a jury is to be informed, in accordance with s 107 of the  
         Criminal Procedure Act 
         , that a delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false, and that there may be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in complaining about it,  
         then 
          it should also be informed that the absence of a complaint or a delay in the making of it may be taken into account in evaluating the evidence of the complainant, and in determining whether to believe him or her (but not in terms reviving the stereotyped view that complainants in sexual assault cases are unreliable or that delay is invariably a sign of the falsity of the complaint:  
         Crofts 
          at 451). 
          
         (d) The  
         KRM 
          direction ( 
         KRM v The Queen 
          (2001) 75 ALJR 550) to the effect that, except where the evidence relating to one count charging sexual assault is admissible, in relation to another count or counts alleging a separate occasion of such an assault, the jury must consider each count separately, and only by reference to the evidence which applies to it; balancing that direction, where appropriate, by a reminder that if the jury has a reasonable doubt concerning the credibility of the complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, they can take that into account when assessing his or her reliability on the other counts (see  
         Regina v Markuleski 
          [2001] NSWCCA 290 at paras 259-263). 
          
         (e) Any warning which may be required by reason of a ruling that limits the use of evidence concerning a complaint, or delay in complaint, to the question of credibility (eg under s 108(3) of the  
         Evidence Act  
         as an exception to the credibility rule), or alternatively that allows it to be taken into account (under s 66 of the  
         Evidence Act 
          as an exception to the hearsay rule) as evidence of the facts asserted. 
          
         (f) The  
         Gipp 
           
         warning 
          (conveniently so called, although there was divided reasoning in  
         Gipp v the Queen 
          (1998) 194 CLR 106) concerning the way in which evidence of uncharged sexual conduct between an accused and a complainant can be taken into account as showing the nature of the relationship between them, but not so as to substitute satisfaction of the occurrence of such conduct for proof of the act charged; 
          
         (g) Any warning that may be necessary in relation to the use of coincidence evidence (under s 98  
         Evidence Act 
         ) where the accused is charged in the one indictment with sexual assault against two or more complainants, requiring the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt first of the offences alleged in respect of one complainant, and then of the existence of such a substantial and relevant similarity between the two sets of acts as to exclude any acceptable explanation other than that the accused committed the offences against both complainants; 
          
         (h) A  
         BRS 
          direction ( 
         BRS v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 275) that where evidence revealing criminal or reprehensible propensity is admitted, but its use is limited to non propensity or tendency purposes, for example those considered proper in that case, then it is to be used only for those purposes and not as proof of the accused’s guilt. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         In all of these circumstances, bearing in mind also the desirability of containing a summing up to an acceptable length; of ensuring its immediate relevance to the actual trial ( 
         Regina v Zorad 
          (1991) 19 NSWLR at 91,  
         Regina v Williams 
          NSWCCA 10 October 1990,  
         KRM v The Queen,  
         and R v Chai 
          [2002] HCA 12 at 18 
         ); of avoiding unnecessary judicial input into the fact finding process ( 
         Azzopardi v The Queen 
          [2001] HCA 24 ); and of paying due respect to the tactical considerations which are best judged by trial counsel in the actual atmosphere of the trial, I consider it timely for there to be a further review of the evidentiary, and other requirements of procedural law that apply to cases of sexual assault, particularly those involving children. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         In summary, in relation to this specific aspect of this appeal, I repeat my concern that the direction currently required amounts to a warning that, in fact, the accused  
         was 
          unable by reason of the delay to test or to meet the prosecution case. Two problems emerge:- 
          
         (a) the giving of such a direction involves a finding of fact that this  
         was 
          the case, whereas it might not be so – indeed it may be positively incorrect; and 
          
         (b) so far as it involves a finding of fact then it intrudes into the proper role of the jury. 
         
        
       
     118 Although these passages cited from both cases are extensive, their importance is such as to warrant reiteration. With the observations of all of their Honours I have cited, I agree. I further observe that where the warning, as here, neglects to draw to the jury's attention that the delay has or may have prevented the testing of the Crown case, there is another side to the commonsense observation of Sully, J. which also involves a judicial intrusion into the jury's function, where such direction as has been given focuses upon the effect of delay on the accused's case rather than the Crown case. In such a case the Crown case may be too readily accepted by the jury, and because the accused is or may be unable to meet it (as the jury have been judicially informed is the case) the conclusion of guilt might be more easily drawn. The absence of an appropriate warning may cause a jury to apply a lesser standard of satisfaction. In my view, an appropriate warning will refer to the possible effects on both the Crown and defence cases and will refer to the difficulty of testing the Crown case and the assessment of the weight to be given to it. 
      
       
     119 The warning is intended to ensure trials are fair which might otherwise have been stayed as abuses for delay. Analysed in this way, an appropriate warning is a legal necessity for a fair trial. The absence of an adequate direction will result in the trial not being a fair trial according to law (see Mraz v. Regina (1955) 93 CLR 493). In such circumstances, it is hard to see room for the application of Rule 4 or the proviso. 
      
       
     120 Heydon, JA. in GPP (supra) regarded the absence of an appropriate direction as not ""fundamental"" in the sense referred to in Regina v. Wilde (1988) 164 CLR 365 and Regina v. Glennon (1994) 179 CLR 1 but as reflecting on whether a conviction might be regarded as inevitable that is, whether the direction would found a basis for the possible experiencing of a reasonable doubt. Such a view relates the necessity for a Longman direction to the onus and standard of proof. Whether its absence would cause such a fundamental defect in the trial as is referred to in those cases need not be resolved since nonetheless its absence would result in a trial which was not a fair trial according to law. Thus unless, postulating a proper direction, the appellate court would have no reasonable doubt of guilt on the evidence at trial, the appeal should be upheld (see Festa v. The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 291). 
      
       
     121 In my view, even though no application for a proper direction is made (unless perhaps, the lack of application was established as proceeding from a tactical consideration), even where, as here, conviction on all or most of the counts in both trials would be inevitable or nearly inevitable, the present state of the law requires that unless there is a direction which approaches nearly enough to the Longman requirements so that the jury could be seen to have the requisite understanding the appeal should be allowed. 
      
       
     122 It is for these reasons I have concluded the appeals should succeed. The evidence is, however, such that there should be new trials. I therefore agree with the orders proposed by Kirby, J. 
      
       
     123 KIRBY J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hodgson JA in draft. There were two broad areas of complaint in respect of each trial. They were:· First, the admission of evidence, either upon the basis of relationship or coincidence, and the directions given in respect of such evidence.· Secondly, the directions given in respect of delay; the so-called Longman Direction. 
      
       
     124 I agree with Hodgson JA, and for the reasons he states, that there was no error in respect of the first issue in either trial. I do not, however, share his Honour's view on the second issue. I shall, therefore, deal with that issue. 
      
       
        
       The  
       Longman 
        Direction 
       
     125 Both trials involved significant delay. It is necessary to look at what was said on the question of delay in each trial. 
      
       
     126 The first trial concerned the allegations of CPS. The appellant (WRC) was indicted on 28 August 2000 upon four counts. The offences were alleged to have been committed at various times between 1 October 1976 and 30 June 1977. CPS was born on 27 August 1968. The appellant was his teacher in Year 3. The proceedings, therefore, were based upon the recollection of CPS, now an adult, of incidents which occurred when he was a child aged approximately eight years. The complaint was first made to the police in 1997, more than 20 years after the events described. The trial, in August 2000, was more than 23 years after the alleged offences. 
      
       
     127 His Honour's directions on this issue, in the first trial, were brief. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         There is also one other matter that I bring to your attention, in which the law requires me to bring to your attention and it is a matter that has been also referred to you by counsel for the accused. And this is: that because of the delay between the time when these events are alleged to have occurred - that is in 1977 in relation to [CPS] and 1978 in relation to [TEL] - and the time of the allegations were brought to police notice, which occurred in 1998, following the police being brought into the matter with the police statement - do you recall the evidence of the police statements being made in January 1997? - following that delay of which is twenty-two or twenty-three years, or thereabouts, the accused has necessarily had difficulties in meeting those allegations. 
          
          
         The examples of the difficulties that were brought to your attention during the course of the trial and the closing addresses are, in a sense, the accused has had to conduct his defence in relation to the allegations that he indecently assaulted [CPS] and [TEL] at the army barracks in 1977 and 1978. And now, after a period of years, [there] have been changes made in some respects to the barracks. An example, of course, is after twenty-two years there is a disputed issue as to what type of floor was on the drill hall; a dispute about what kind of windows were in the drill hall (painted or frosted); what was the situation in relation to an occasion, was it a parade day when the squadron was being presented to 100 to 150 people milling around; or was it an occasion when the squadrons were not there and there was only a skeleton staff, perhaps a dozen, or in some cases perhaps two or three. 
          
          
         I am just drawing your attention to these issues which have arisen in this trial, and the fact that you, the jury, are asked to reflect on and consider findings in relation to disputed issues that deal with matters that are some twenty-two or twenty-three years in the past. 
         
        
       
     128 The second trial was the consequence of allegations by TEL. The appellant was indicted on 30 October 2000 upon seven counts. The offences were said to have taken place at various times between 18 February 1978 and 28 January 1979. The complainant was born on 10 March 1969. He went to the same school as CPS. The appellant was his teacher. The complainant first made a complaint in 1979 to the school authorities. He made a statement to the police in 1997. TEL was, at the time of the alleged offences, about nine years old. The trial took place more than 21 years after the events described. 
      
       
     129 In the second trial, his Honour summed up on this issue in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         There is one further direction that I give you in relation to this matter and that is this, that because of the delay between the time when these events are alleged to have occurred, that is in 1978, and the time when these allegations were brought to ... notice, it (sic) necessarily had difficulty in meeting these allegations. 
          
          
         That is a matter, members of the jury, that I am bound under the law to bring to your attention and to remind you of those difficulties. 
          
          
         It is a matter that you should take into consideration, that is the prejudice that has been suffered by the accused in meeting these claims, meeting these allegations, that his ability to recall and gather evidence pointing to his innocence has been adversely affected. 
          
          
         That is a matter for you to consider. It is a matter for you to take into account, as I say, that he has been placed in a difficult situation, now having to answer allegations relating to 1978. 
          
          
         Now ... the accused has been placed in a situation of hardship in adequately and properly preparing his defence by reason of that delay by reason of the fact that the matters that might have been fresh in the memory in 1978 might well have faded from memory. And there may be other matters that could have been attended to but were not. 
          
          
         And in this case, you heard from Mr Webb, counsel for the accused, refer to the difficulties in relation to a number of disputed issues such as was there a stencilling room in the ... Prep School in 1978 on the first floor. 
          
          
         And the difficulty in the year 2000 of ascertaining what the position was. Did he have a mustardy coloured four door sedan in 1978, or did he not. Was the school playing cricket on Saturday at Primrose Park or not. And there are other matters that you have been told about, and they are matters, members of the jury, that you should reflect on and consider in relation to the fact that there has been an absence of complaints. 
         
        
       
     130 Each case, therefore, concerned allegations of sexual molestation of a young child. One, at least, involved delay in making any complaint. Both cases involved significant delay in prosecution. A Longman warning was called for in each case. The Crown did not suggest otherwise. 
      
       
     131 The appellant complains that, in neither trial, did the directions conform with the requirements of Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79. The deficiencies asserted by the appellant, common to both trials, were as follows:· First, the direction was not given with the firm voice and authority of the Judge administering a warning, identifying matters which the jury was bound to take into account. Rather, the issues were put in a way which suggested they were a summary of points made by counsel.· Secondly, the appellant's difficulties, caused by delay, were not adequately identified. The only matter identified, namely, the physical changes to the army barracks, was an aspect which was relatively minor.· Thirdly, no reference was made to the need for extreme caution before acting upon the recollection of events that occurred in early childhood. 
      
       
     132 A number of issues arise:· First, what is required by a Longman warning?· Secondly, were those requirements met, or substantially met, in the directions given in each trial?· Thirdly, if they were not, is there any room for the application of Rule 4, or the proviso? 
      
       
        
       The Requirements of  
       Longman 
       
     133 The statement of principle in respect of the obligation to warn juries comes, of course, from the joint judgment of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Longman v The Queen (supra), where their Honours said this: (at 91) 
      
       
        
         
         But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning be given to them: see  
         Reg v Spencer  
         [1987] AC 141. That factor was the applicant's loss of those means of testing the complainant's allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant's story or confirming the applicant's denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant's recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see  
         Jago v District Court (NSW) 
          (1989) 168 CLR 23) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient."" 
         
        
       
     134 The need for such a warning can be traced to two matters (cf Kirby J, Doggett v The Queen (2001) 182 ALR 1 at 26). They are matters known to the Courts through experience, but unlikely to be known to juries, unless the subject of a warning. The first matter was described by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Crampton v The Queen (2000) 176 ALR 369, in these words: (at 379) 
      
       
        
         
         ... the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. 
         
        
       
     135 Their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. 
         
        
       
     136 In Doggett v The Queen (2001) 182 ALR 1, Gaudron and Callinan JJ elaborated in these words: (at 11) 
      
       
        
         
         ... the problems with which  
         Longman 
          is intended to deal are not confined to difficulties of recollection that the passage of time might cause for an accused. Of equal, and in some cases of which this might be one, of more importance is the denial by the effluxion of time, to an accused of the forensic weapons that a timely complaint might allow an accused to assemble, such as evidence as to where he was or what he was doing, or what other potential witnesses were doing when the offences were alleged to have occurred."" 
         
        
       
     137 The second matter emerges from the judgments of Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman. McHugh J said this: (at 107) 
      
       
        
         
         The fallibility of human recollection and the effect of imagination, emotion, prejudice and suggestion on the capacity to 'remember' is well documented. 
         
        
       
     138 His Honour added: (at 107/108) 
      
       
        
         
         Recollection of events which occurred in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and is also subject to the possibility that it may not even be genuine. 
         
        
       
     139 The first of these matters has been questioned by this Court in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60 (Wood CJ at CL, Sully and Dowd JJ). In that case the trial Judge gave a warning which was framed in terms of the accused possibly having difficulties occasioned by delay (""it may have resulted in some difficulties for the accused in defending himself""), rather than the accused in fact having such difficulties. Applying Longman, the Court of Criminal Appeal felt obliged to uphold the appeal. Had Longman (and the cases after it), been expressed less emphatically, as their Honours clearly believed appropriate, then the appeal would have been dismissed. Wood CJ at CL said this: (para 13/15) 
      
       
        
         
         13. These passages have been taken up, so it seems to me, as requiring that an instruction in equally positive terms, be given in every case involving a substantial delay, irrespective of whether or not there is any evidence, or basis beyond suspicion, that the absence of contemporaneity between the alleged offence and the complaint, or trial has  
         in fact 
          (not 'might have') denied to the accused a proper opportunity to meet the charge or charges brought: see for example  
         R v Roddom 
          [2001] NSWCCA 168,  
         R v GJH 
          [2001]NSWCCA 128 and  
         R v Roberts  
         [2001] NSWCCA 163. 
          
          
         14. Put another way, the effect of these decisions has been to give rise to an irrebuttable presumption that the delay  
         has 
          prevented the accused from adequately testing and meeting the complainant's evidence; and that, as a consequence, the jury must be given a warning to that effect irrespective of whether or not the accused was in fact prejudiced in this way. 
          
          
         15. The difficulty which I have with this proposition is that it elevates the presumption of innocence, which must be preserved at all costs, to an assumption that the accused was  
         in fact 
          innocent, and that he or she might have called relevant evidence, or cross examined the complainant in a way that would have rebutted the prosecution case, had there been a contemporaneity between the alleged offence and the complaint or charge. That consideration loses all of its force if, in fact, the accused  
         did commit 
          the offence. In that event there would have been no evidence available of a positive kind, relating for example to the existence or ownership of the premises, or of a motor vehicle or other item, associated with the offence charged, or going to establish an alibi for the relevant occasion, no matter how contemporaneous the complaint or charge was with the offence. (emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     140 His Honour recognised that, as a matter of common sense, delay can, and in many cases will, occasion difficulties to an accused. However, Wood CJ at CL identified his difficulty with Longman, as it has been interpreted, in these words: (para 18) 
      
       
        
         
         These are matters which can and should properly be placed before a jury, as relevant to its assessment of the prosecution case. My concern lies more with the unequivocal nature of a  
         warning 
         , which must be given by a trial judge who does not himself or herself know where the truth lies, that the accused  
         was  
         unable 
          to adequately test and meet the prosecution case"" (emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     141 However, with respect, I disagree. Significant delay does create disadvantage, guilty or innocent. Our system of criminal justice seeks to fireproof each conviction against error. It does so through the combined operation of the fundamental principles of criminal justice (the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt) and the adversarial system. The accused may cross examine and call evidence. The proof offered by the Crown must be sufficiently robust to withstand the assault upon it even of the guilty. 
      
       
     142 The potency of cross examination as a means of exposing unreliable evidence diminishes significantly with time. In State v Saporen (1939) 205 Minn 358 (quoted in McCormick on Evidence, 2nd Ed (1972), page 602), the following was said: 
      
       
        
         
         The chief merit of cross-examination is not that at some future time it gives the party opponent the right to dissect adverse testimony. Its principal virtue is the immediate application of the testing process. Its strokes fall while the iron is hot. False testimony is apt to harden and become unyielding to the blows of truth in proportion as the witness has opportunity for reconsideration and influence by the suggestions of others. ... 
         
        
       
     143 The method of cross examination is an attack upon detail, exposing contradictions and unreliability. If the trial is undertaken within a reasonable time, the excuse for unreliability of fading memory is unlikely to be persuasive. However, where the trial is delayed, the accused is disadvantaged in two ways. First, the testimony is likely to be more vague, bereft of the detail which may be used to expose unreliability. Secondly, that absence of detail, and any contradiction that may happen to emerge, can the more easily be explained by reference to the passage of time. The jury therefore is more likely to be forgiving of shortcomings in the complainant's evidence, especially in the context of charges which arouse strong feelings of prejudice or revulsion (cf Kirby J Doggett (supra) at 25, para 118). 
      
       
     144 Returning to the requirements of Longman, Sully J in R v BWT (supra) provided a helpful analysis of matters which must be included to conform with the authorities. His Honour said this: (para 95) 
      
       
        
         
         95[3] ... Not only  
         must 
          the direction be given; but it  
         must 
          be cast in a form that manifests, and is seen plainly to manifest, certain characteristics which one can draw, as follows, from the various statements of principle in  
         Longman 
          itself and in the subsequent decisions in  
         Crampton 
          and in  
         Doggett 
         : 
          
         (a) The direction must be cast in the form of a  
         warning 
         . 
          Any form of expression which is thought to have the character of a  
         comment 
         , 
          or even of a  
         caution 
          will not sufficiently comply with what is required by law. 
          
          
         It seems to me to follow that any trial Judge who is framing a  
         Longman 
          direction ought to ensure that the direction is framed, in terms, as a  
         warning 
         . 
          
          
         (b) That which is to be warned against is, to return to the majority judgment in  
         Longman 
          itself:  
         'that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of [the particular period relevant in the particular trial], it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, was satisfied of its truth and accuracy’ 
         . 
          (emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     145 His Honour then distilled six matters which a Longman direction should include. He said this: (para 95) 
      
       
        
         
         95[3] ... a trial Judge who is framing a Longman direction must ensure that the final form of the direction to the jury covers in terms the following propositions: first, that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested; secondly, that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone; thirdly, that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy; fourthly, that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care; fifthly, that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing 
           
         upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant's evidence; and sixthly, that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant's evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction 
         . 
         
        
        
       The Directions in these Cases 
       
     146 The directions given in the first trial, in my view, plainly did not conform, or substantially conform, to these requirements. The direction was not framed as a warning. Arguably, the direction adequately dealt with the difficulties which the accused experienced in presenting his own case. The jury was told that the accused necessarily had difficulties in meeting the allegations by reason of the delay. An illustration was provided concerning the appearance of the army barracks, which had changed. However, the jury was not told that the complainant could not be adequately tested by reason of the delay. Nor was reference made to many of the other issues identified by Sully J. 
      
       
     147 The direction given by the learned trial Judge in the first trial, it will be noticed, was significantly less detailed, and covered fewer of the issues catalogued by Sully J, than the Longman direction in R v BWT (supra), which was found by the Court of Criminal Appeal not to be adequate. 
      
       
     148 Further, having regard to the age of the complainant, when the events which he was describing occurred, it was important that his Honour warn the jury of the fragility of recollection in one so young. 
      
       
     149 The directions in the second trial were more detailed. However, I believe that they also plainly failed to conform to the requirements of Longman, for many of the same reasons. 
      
       
     150 Although, in the context of the warning, it would have been appropriate to refer to matters which may be regarded as confirmation of the complainant's account (including the striking similarity of the evidence given by the other boy), that did not, in my view, remove the need for such warning. The disadvantage to the appellant arising from delay remained, whether there was corroboration or not. The jury needed to be told about it, so that its assessment of the complainant's evidence (and that of the other boy) could be made with an appreciation of the appellant's position. 
      
       
     151 In both trials, therefore, I believe that error has been established. 
      
       
        
       Rule 4 and the Proviso 
       
     152 No objection was taken at either trial to the directions which are now impugned. Rule 4 therefore applies. 
      
       
     153 In R v GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493, Heydon JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ agreed) made the following remarks on the availability of Rule 4, in the context of a failure to conform with Longman: (para 60) 
      
       
        
         
         60. The Crown's first point in answer was that counsel for the appellant did not seek at the trial the direction which it is now said should have been given, and that leave is required under r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to advance these grounds. Counsel's failure is regrettable, but if the appellant's criticisms are sound, they are, in the light of the High Court authorities, sufficiently important for leave to be given, as it customarily is by this Court in cases concerning  
         Longman 
          directions. 
         
        
       
     154 In the same case, Heydon JA made the following comment upon the proviso: (para 111) 
      
       
        
         
         111. The application of the proviso depends on the error not being one which is so fundamental as to have caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all, and on the conviction being 'inevitable', so that the appellant can be said not to have lost a chance which was fairly open to him to have been acquitted. See  
         Glennon v R 
          (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712. This error is not fundamental in the sense just described. Attention must therefore be directed to the strength of the Crown case. 
         
        
       
     155 Here, unquestionably, the Crown case against the appellant in both trials was strong. However, I do not believe in either case it can be said that conviction was inevitable (Doggett v The Queen (supra) Gaudron and Callinan (para 55) (182 ALR 1 at 12); Kirby J (para 151) (182 ALR 1 at 33)). Again, the comment of Heydon JA in R v GPP (supra) is apposite: (para 112) 
      
       
        
         
         112. The appellant's submission that the Crown case was weak is baseless. But once it is assumed, as it must be, that the prejudicial effect of delay on the forensic position of the appellant was not obvious to the jury, unless it had been explained to them, the warning which was not given could have caused them to experience a reasonable doubt. 
         
        
       
     156 Therefore, I believe the appropriate order is as follows: 
      
       
       1. The appeal in respect of each trial is upheld. 
        
       2. The conviction recorded as a result of each trial is quashed and the sentences set aside. 
        
       3. There should in each case be a new trial.

      REGINA v. BENJAMIN BRUCE ANDREW 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender has pleaded guilty in this Court to one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That offence is punishable by a maximum sentence of imprisonment of five years. The essential facts are not in contest. 
     
      
    2 The offence was committed on 19 May 1990 when the offender was then aged 16 and was a boarding school student. Shortly prior to that date the deceased, a teacher had, as far as I can ascertain from the agreed facts and the material provided on the plea, using alcoholic liquor, seduced the offender into homosexual acts and infected the offender with a venereal disease. 
     
      
    3 Disturbed about that infection and the deceased’s acts with him the offender had complained to his best friend. The two of them went to the deceased’s premises. The offender had prior to doing so discussed with his friend that he might hit the deceased with a small baseball bat that they took with them to the premises. 
     
      
    4 However, on arrival at the premises he did not do that. He sought to speak to the deceased who was a teacher and an older man, concerning his feelings about what had occurred. He was under considerable distress. The deceased did not wish to talk to him but instead suggested they watch a video. The offender understandably, having regard to what had occurred on the previous occasion, conceived the idea that the video was likely to be a pornographic video and that he might be the subject of a further homosexual approach. 
     
      
    5 In a mixed emotional state involving on his part some degree of fear, some degree of anger, some degree of frustration, he struck the deceased to the head with the baseball bat splitting his scalp and causing some bruising. He also struck the deceased a couple of times to the back. The evidence does not permit me to conclude that the blows to the back occasioned the deceased any injury. 
     
      
    6 Thereafter the offender's friend did the acts which killed the deceased. 
     
      
    7 In consequence in due course they were both charged with murder. After a trial the offender was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter, the jury making a recommendation for leniency. 
     
      
    8 He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a minimum term of four years. His companion was convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years. 
     
      
    9 The offender successfully appealed that conviction and following the appeal being upheld was acquitted at a further trial of the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    10 Both at his murder trial and his manslaughter trial he gave evidence of the facts of the offence. I have been provided with a summary of that evidence by the Crown which is exhibit A and short extracts from the offender’s evidence. It is on that evidence that the Crown relies to make out the offence. 
     
      
    11 The involvement of the offender and his companion in the events did not come to light until some seven years after the occasion of the killing. It occurred in consequence of the co-offender having split from his wife and she informed the police. 
     
      
    12 The offender when first interviewed did not admit his role but has admitted his role, as I have set it out, in his evidence in the two sets of proceedings and by his plea before me. 
     
      
    13 Some moths after acquittal on the manslaughter charge, notice was given by the Director of Public Prosecutions of an intent to lay an ex officio indictment charging the offender with malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and malicious wounding, the latter charge in the alternative to the former. 
     
      
    14 On arraignment, the offender pleaded not guilty to those two charges. Thereafter, the matter came before me to determine pre-trial issues including the availability of a plea raising a res judicata or a plea in bar or whether the proceedings should be stayed. This last was said to arise in consequence of evidence put before me concerning the effects of the proceedings upon the offender where he had not been charged with the charges contained in the ex officio indictment in the earlier proceedings so as to permit one or other of the two juries to have considered those charges as possible alternatives to murder or manslaughter. 
     
      
    15 I was provided with an affidavit of 22 May 2002 by Christopher John Hammond, solicitor, which sets out the chronology to which I make summary reference by consent of both parties for the purposes of this sentence. 
     
      
    16 The offender following his arrest spent some days in custody and then was released on bail until 28 April 1999. He thereafter was detained in custody until 19 April 2000 when he was released to conditional bail with a condition involving some reporting until his acquittal on the manslaughter charge. He was, of course, unconditionally at liberty following that acquittal until the ex officio indictment was presented. 
     
      
    17 Following the presentation of the ex officio indictment he was placed on unconditional bail. That bail, however, as do all bails, required him to be of good behaviour. 
     
      
    18 Prior to being taken into custody on 28 April 1999 and after his apprehension on 16 May 1997 he was on conditional bail which not only required that condition but also required him to report daily. 
     
      
    19 During the argument concerning the application to stay or otherwise to determine the appropriateness of the indictment for malicious wounding questions arose concerning the ambit of the facts to which regard might be had in the light of the prior acquittals and which might support the allegation of malice contained in both charges in that indictment. 
     
      
    20 In consequence of that debate, the Director of Public Prosecutions determined to proceed no further with the indictment in that form and a nolle prosequi was entered. 
     
      
    21 A new indictment was preferred containing the present charge and it is to that charge in that indictment the offender has pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    22 There has been tendered on his behalf, without objection or challenge by the Crown, the report of Dr. Skinner dated 21 May 2002 and the two reports of Dr. Susan Hayes dated 28 March 2002 and 29 April 2002. 
     
      
    23 There have also been tendered, similarly without objection or challenge, three statements from persons who had known the offender for most of their and his lives. Those statements testify to the anguish the events have caused to him and the support of his family to him. They testify to his being an asset to society. Not only do they refer to the pain and suffering the unfortunate events caused to him but to his present commitment to embark upon an occupation designed to relieve the pain and suffering of others. 
     
      
    24 I have also been provided with his affidavit sworn 17 April 2002. The Crown has not sought to cross examine him on that affidavit, its contents are unchallenged. 
     
      
    25 In particular in paragraph four it refers to matters which had been the subject of statements made by him to the psychiatrists and on which they have relied as history, that is, that he had suffered immensely from depression and had attempted suicide but had been talked out of it by a police officer and then removed to a psychiatric hospital. 
     
      
    26 It refers to him as being appalled by and feeling guilty because of the conviction and sentence of his friend. It refers to the experience he underwent when in gaol while he watched the violence and barbaric behaviour of certain of the inmates, in particular when he was placed, notwithstanding his age, in a secure gaol and for some time with a person whom he believed was likely sexually to assault him and where he was placed in the same gaol as a person he witnessed being killed by other inmates using sardine can lids. 
     
      
    27 He refers to his inability to live an independent life and to study. He refers to the difficulties he has had obtaining employment when the circumstances of his outstanding charges have come to the knowledge of employers. 
     
      
    28 All of what he says accords with the observations of him made by the psychiatrists. Because of his involvement in this matter and because of the two trial, he has been the subject of wide publicity which has contributed to his depression. He has attempted suicide on other occasions to that to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    29 The psychiatric reports refer to the consequences to him of the venereal disease with which he had been infected by the deceased. The medical consequences of that matter have been grave to him primarily because in the context of what had happened to the deceased and in the context of his own embarrassment he was unable to disclose that the disease affected him for some years during which time its consequences for his health were most severe eventuality requiring surgical intervention. He has from time to time of necessity had to resort to anti depressant medication. 
     
      
    30 It is apparent that an important aspect of his life physically and emotionally has gone as a consequence of what had happened to him and the conduct in which he participated. 
     
      
    31 Both psychiatrists shared the view that for him to go to trial again was to invite not only a suicide attempt but the real prospect of a completed suicide. 
     
      
    32 He has, it is clear, suffered severe emotional and psychological scarring but that is not all that I must take into account. If that were all I took into account I would be falling into error. I must have regard also to the objective culpability of what he did in assaulting the victim and I do so. 
     
      
    33 The fact that he took the baseball bat with him clearly evidences some degree of planning if on a contingency for the infliction of violence to the victim. It was a planned assault in that sense. Having regard to the acquittals and the principle in The Queen v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383) I do not regard it as appropriate for me to take into account that he and his friend additionally took to the premises duct tape. 
     
      
    34 Similarly, I do not regard it as appropriate to take into account against him the other consequences of their attendance at the premises. He has been acquitted of an involvement in the killing and necessarily I must not aggravate his sentence by finding facts reflecting any complicity in it. It would be contrary to legal principle to regard his culpability as in any way aggravated by what occurred in the premises other than that encompassed in this charge and to which I have referred, since so to do would be to have regard to matters associating him with the co-offender’s crime.  
     
      
    35 Taking those matters into account I also must have regard to the fact that at the time had he been dealt with in a children’s court for this offence the regime then applicable in that court might have allowed him to be dealt with according to law but it is unlikely. 
     
      
    36 Indeed, it is probable having regard to the regime as it then was, to which I must have regard in the light of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in MJR v. The Queen [2002] NSWCCA 129 that there would have been a finding that the facts made out the offence but there would not have been a consequential conviction having regard to his lack of prior record. 
     
      
    37 It is highly likely that in the circumstances a court then dealing with this charge would have imposed no other sanction other than possibly a reprimand. 
     
      
    38 Such as I understand it is recognised by the Crown Prosecutor who, having regard to the custody in which the offender has been placed over the years and the terms and conditions of bail, has submitted that no further custodial sanction need be imposed. When senior counsel for the offender informed the Court that he sought that s.10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 be applied the Crown Prosecutor informed me that on the Crown’s behalf no submissions were made in opposition to that course being taken and that I would not be falling into appellable error were I minded to exercise in these circumstances the discretion conferred upon me by that section. 
     
      
    39 In addition, the Crown has conceded, having regard to the fact that the offender has not again come under notice notwithstanding the stringency of his conditional liberty during this long period, that it would be inappropriate to impose any further restrictions by way of bond on the offender for the future. 
     
      
    40 It is necessary then that I give consideration to whether without proceeding to conviction I should make an order under s.10(1)(a) directing that the relevant charge be dismissed. I am, in that regard, referred by s.10(3), to the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, the trivial nature of the offence, the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed and any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider. 
     
      
    41 I do not consider that this offence was of a trivial nature. I do consider that there were highly extenuating circumstances, and I particularly have regard to the offender’s age, health, mental condition, his lack of any prior adverse record whether at school or otherwise, and the good character he has enjoyed prior to and since the offence. 
     
      
    42 It is not only in the circumstance that the offence is a trivial one that s.10 might operate. The width of the discretion to make an order under s.10 is wide. 
     
      
    43 I have concluded, having regard to the effects on the offender, having regard to the contrition, remorse and guilt that he has expressed, particularly to the psychiatrists and evidenced so clearly over the years, having regard to the extenuating circumstances to which I have referred and those other matters to which s.10 speaks, that this is a proper case in all the circumstances for the making of an order under s.10. 
     
      
    44 Benjamin Bruce Andrew, without proceeding to conviction, you having been found guilty on your plea, I make an order directing that the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm referred to in the indictment be dismissed under s.10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999.

      BERECRY & 2 ORS 
     On 6 October 1995, Mr D K Berecry was injured while on the premises of North Sydney Leagues Club Ltd (“the Club”). He sustained head injuries and resultant brain damage after being struck by a blow from Mr C N Lambeth, a security officer. Mr Berecry brought proceedings in the District Court against the Club, Mr Lambeth, and Venue Security (NSW) Pty Ltd (“Venue”), Mr Lambeth’s employer. McGuire DCJ entered a verdict in the sum of $376,923 in favour of Mr Berecry. His Honour also found that the Club was entitled to contribution from Mr Lambeth and Venue each as to 25% respectively of the verdict.The Club appeals from the verdict and also maintains its cross-claim for full indemnification from Venue for breach of contract. The Club’s appeal raises essentially three issues. First, whether the Club delegated its duty of care by delegating to Venue the tasks of security and control of patrons. Secondly, whether the Club was in breach of its duty of care. Finally, there is a challenge to the quantum of the damages. Mr Lambeth also brought a cross-appeal in which he claims that he is not liable in negligence to Mr Berecry because the blow he delivered was struck in self-defence or in defence of another security officer. He also challenges the quantum of the damages.Held:On the appeal, per Pearlman AJA, Meagher JA and Stein JA agreeing:1 It was open to the trial judge to conclude that the role of Venue was to assist the Club in carrying out its security functions. There was no evidence of a delegation to an independent contractor of the Club’s duty of care.2 The Club could, but did not, intervene in what was a potentially dangerous situation. It was reasonably foreseeable that injury might occur to Mr Berecry but despite ample and observable warning, the Club’s officials took no action to prevent that injury and accordingly the trial judge’s finding of breach of duty of care should not be disturbed. 
      
       
     3 Mr Lambeth was at all relevant times acting within the scope of his authority (cf Deatons Pty Ltd v Flew (1949) 79 CLR 370). 
      
       
     4 It was open to the trial judge to conclude that it was not possible to find that Venue was in breach of any contractual term, or that the Club was entitled to indemnification, due to the lack of evidence as to the terms and conditions of the contract. 
      
       
     5 It was open to his Honour to accept the evidence of other witnesses over the evidence of Mr Lambeth so as to find that Mr Lambeth’s blow was intentional and unnecessary and was not delivered in self-defence or in defence of another security officer.

     3 PEARLMAN AJA: IntroductionOn 6 October 1995, Mr David Kenneth Berecry was injured while on the premises of North Sydney Leagues Club Ltd (“the Club”). He sustained head injuries and resultant brain damage after being struck by a blow from a security officer which caused him to fall onto tiles inside the entrance to the Club. 
      
       
     4 Mr Berecry took proceedings in the District Court against the Club, the security officer, Mr Craig Noel Lambeth, and Venue Security (NSW) Pty Ltd, the employer of Mr Lambeth. His Honour Judge McGuire entered a verdict in the sum of $376,923 in favour of Mr Berecry. The trial judge found that the Club was entitled to contribution from Mr Lambeth and Venue Security (NSW) Pty Ltd (“Venue”) each as to 25% respectively of the verdict.5 The Club now appeals from the verdict, and Mr Lambeth has brought a cross-appeal. Venue is now in liquidation, and did not appear on the appeal. 
      
       
     6 The Club has appealed on numerous grounds, but essentially they raise the following issues: 
      
       
     (1) Delegation of duty of care; 
      
       
     (2) Breach of duty of care, including causation and foreseeability;  
      
       
     (3) Volenti non fit injuria;  
      
       
     (4) Contributory negligence; and  
      
       
     (5) Quantum. 
      
       
       In addition, the Club maintains its cross-claim for indemnification from Venue. 
        
       
     7 Mr Lambeth’s cross-appeal was also based on numerous grounds, but essentially he claims that he is not liable in negligence to Mr Berecry, because the blow he delivered was struck in self-defence or in defence of another security officer. He also raises quantum as a ground of appeal. 
      
       
     8 I deal with all of these grounds (although not in the order set out above), but first it is convenient to refer to the incident. 
      
       
        
       The Incident 
        
       
     9 McGuire DCJ made the following findings of fact in relation to what occurred on the Club’s premises at the relevant date: 
      
       
     (a) A group of persons, including Mr Berecry, were drinking, and they became loud and rowdy. They were asked to leave the premises, first by Ms T Bloomfield, one of the Club’s duty managers, and then by Mr Lambeth; 
      
       
     (b) Ultimately, Mr Berecry walked out of the Club with Mr Lambeth beside him, and Mr Lambeth was taunting and abusing Mr Berecry; 
      
       
     (c) Mr Berecry left the premises, and stood outside the glass entrance door. Mr Lambeth continued to taunt him, and Mr Berecry, who was agitated, went back inside through the glass doors. He was not rushing and his arms were at his side; 
      
       
     (d) When Mr Berecry re-entered through the glass door, he was struck by Mr Lambeth intentionally and unnecessarily. 
      
       
     10 These findings were based on the evidence of Messrs Baker, Carew and Cropper, who were friends of Mr Berecry and with him at the time. The trial judge noted that there were discrepancies in their respective accounts of the incident, but he found those persons to be “highly credible witnesses” (RAB p 63), and he accepted their accounts in preference to the account proffered by Mr Lambeth. I shall return to this aspect of the findings later. 
      
       
        
       The Club’s duty of care 
       
      
      
       
       Did the Club delegate its duty of care? 
       
     11 It is not in dispute that the Club owed a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of Mr Berecry whilst on its premises. The issue was whether the Club had, on the facts, delegated its duty of care to Venue by delegating the tasks of security and control of patrons. If it had done so, the issue would then arise as to whether it nevertheless owed a non-delegable duty of care to Mr Berecry so that the Club remained liable to him despite the appointment of Venue. 
      
       
     12 The only evidence at the trial about the contractual relationship between the Club and Venue were two documents both tendered on behalf of Mr Berecry. One was a letter dated 30 August 1995 (“the Venue letter”) from Venue to the operations manager of the Club. The other (“the job description”) was a document on the Club’s letterhead containing a description about a job entitled “Security Person”. No evidence was adduced by the Club or by Venue about the contractual relationship between them. 
      
       
     13 His Honour found that the Club had not delegated its security functions to Venue. That finding was clearly open to his Honour. The Venue letter, in rather puffed up language, asserted that Venue would provide to the Club experienced and licensed security personnel to handle all security and crowd control. The job description, however, stated that the objective of the security person would be to “assist in maintaining good order at all times and ensure that the security and safety of all staff and patrons … is maintained …” (emphasis added). The operational section of the job description stated that the security officer would take instructions from, and report to, the duty manager. It stated that such matters as “general misbehaviour” were the “primary role of the management” of the Club, and it repeated that the security officer would “assist management” in the restraint or removal of violent or abusive patrons. 
      
       
     14 The Venue letter and the job description provide some evidence of a relationship between the Club and Venue. It was a relationship in which Venue was to assist the Club in carrying out its security functions. Those documents do not provide evidence of a delegation to an independent contractor of the Club’s duty to provide security and safety on its premises. 
      
       
     15 That conclusion is supported by the roles which the Club’s duty managers and Mr Lambeth fulfilled at the relevant time (as I describe in par 18). They jointly participated in dealing with Mr Berecry and his companions whose behaviour was obstreperous. 
      
       
     16 The finding that the Club had not delegated its duty of care renders it unnecessary for the Court to determine whether or not the duty was delegable as contended for by the Club on the basis of Newcastle Entertainment Security Pty Ltd v Simpson & Ors (1999) Aust Tort Reports 81-528. 
      
       
       Was the Club in breach of its duty of care? 
       
     17 The Club asserts that the incident in which Mr Berecry was injured was solely a consequence of the actions of Mr Lambeth, and there was nothing that the Club could or should have done to have averted the injury. 
      
       
     18 As summarised in par 9 above, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Messrs Berecry, Carew, Baker and Cropper that Mr Lambeth was taunting and provoking Mr Berecry as he walked with Mr Berecry to the doors of the Club, and that Mr Lambeth continued to taunt and provoke Mr Berecry through the glass doors. His Honour found that Mr Lambeth’s provocative behaviour was plainly observable.19 But the facts demonstrate, and his Honour so found, that the Club could, but did not, intervene in what was a potentially dangerous situation. Some of those facts were derived from Ex 9 which was a transcript taken from the hearing in the Local Court of a prosecution against Mr Lambeth for assault. Mr Gee QC, appearing for the Club, claimed that Ex 9 was admitted at the trial only as against Venue and Mr Lambeth. The transcript of the trial reveals no such conditional admission, and the parties are at issue on this point. In these circumstances, I proceed on the basis of the transcript. 
      
       
     20 The situation was that Club personnel were standing nearby when Mr Berecry was struck. One such person was Ms Bloomfield, who had directed Mr Lambeth to ask Mr Berecry and his companions to leave. Another was Mr S Munroe, another of the Club’s duty managers, and a further person was the doorman, Mr Smith. As his Honour found, an obvious measure would have been for these Club officials to direct Mr Lambeth away from the door and to instruct him to cease his provocative conduct. It was reasonably foreseeable that injury might occur to Mr Berecry. But, despite ample and observable warning that the situation could become dangerous, the officials took no action. 
      
       
     21 Furthermore, this is not a case where Mr Lambeth committed an independent personal act which was not connected with or incidental in any manner to the work which he was expressly or implicitly authorised to perform (cf Deatons Pty Ltd v Flew (1949) 79 CLR 370). The scope of authority of security officers was described by Mr R W Jennings, an expert in security matters. His evidence was that, in carrying out their duties, they should use as little force as is necessary, and that was a matter of judgment. Mr Lambeth said his instructions were to use minimal force. Having regard to this evidence, I am of the opinion that Mr Lambeth was, at all relevant times, acting within the scope of his authority. 
      
       
     22 The inescapable conclusion is that the Club breached its duty of care to Mr Berecry, and the trial judge was not in error in so finding. 
      
       
       The Club’s cross-claim against Venue 
       
     23 The Club asserts that it was a term of the contract between it and Venue that Venue would provide to the Club experienced security personnel who were to “provide the highest level of professional security to a business community requiring totally dependable service …”. The Club claims that Mr Lambeth’s assault upon Mr Berecry was a breach of that term of the contract, and that, accordingly, the Club is entitled to be fully indemnified by Venue in respect of any damages and costs associated with defending Mr Berecry’s claim and pursuing its cross-claim against Venue.  
      
       
     24 The trial judge rejected this claim on the basis that he was not able to determine the true terms and conditions of the contract and that as a consequence he was not prepared to find that Venue breached any implied or express contractual obligation (RAB p 78). 
      
       
     25 In my opinion, this finding was open to his Honour. Neither the Club nor Venue adduced any evidence as to their contractual relationship. The only documents evidencing some sort of relationship were the Venue letter and the job description, but neither of those documents provides any evidence of the precise terms and conditions of the contract. The most that can be gleaned from those documents is that, on the one hand, Venue offered to provide qualified professional security personnel to assist the Club in carrying out security functions, and, on the other hand, the Club provided a description of the duties and responsibilities of a person who might so assist it. Whether the Club accepted Venue’s offer, and upon what terms and conditions, is simply not in evidence. It follows that the Club has not established that Venue was in breach of any contractual term, and the trial judge’s dismissal of its cross-claim should not be disturbed. 
      
       
       The Club’s further grounds of appeal 
       
     26 The Club claimed that it had raised the defence of volenti non fit injuria at the trial, but it was asserted on behalf of Mr Berecry that such a defence was neither pleaded by the Club nor raised in submissions at the trial. In any event, the trial judge found that Mr Berecry had his arms at his sides when he returned through the glass doors, and that he was not rushing. The suggestion that Mr Berecry was threatening to fight and perceived the danger of doing so cannot be sustained on the evidence accepted by his Honour. Accordingly, a defence of volenti non fit injuria has not been made out. 
      
       
     27 On a similar basis, the trial judge rejected a reduction in the verdict on the basis of contributory negligence. The trial judge accepted that Mr Berecry had orally abused Mr Lambeth, but his Honour did not accept that Mr Berecry re-entered the Club in a violent manner or that Mr Berecry would have expected to be assaulted by Mr Lambeth. The evidence of Messrs Baker, Carew and Cropper establishes that Mr Berecry was agitated and himself abusing Mr Lambeth on his way out of the Club and whilst outside the glass doors. The video photographs (to which I refer in par 32) reinforce this impression of Mr Berecry’s conduct, because they show him apparently shouting outside the glass doors and at one time pointing with his finger. But, as I have earlier set out, Mr Berecry returned through the glass doors with his arms at his side, and the video photographs support that finding. It was accordingly open to his Honour to find that Mr Berecry’s conduct did not contribute to the injury inflicted upon him.  
      
       
       Credibility and the cross-appeal 
       
     28 Mr Lambeth’s case is that the trial judge fell into error in accepting the account of the incident put forward by Messrs Berecry, Baker, Carew and Cropper. That account was inconsistent with the account put forward by Mr Lambeth and by Mr M The, another security officer. It was put that, in resolving that inconsistency, the trial judge failed to give proper weight to the evidence of Mr The, whose account corroborated that of Mr Lambeth. 
      
       
     29 Messrs Baker, Carew and Cropper were adamant in their testimony that Mr Berecry walked back through the glass doors with his arms at his side. They each denied, in various ways, that Mr Berecry had his arms raised or that he lunged towards Mr Lambeth or went to strike him. Mr Lambeth’s account, however, was that Mr Berecry came through the door towards him with one of his arms raised, and that he ducked his head to avoid being struck by Mr Berecry.  
      
       
     30 His Honour rejected the evidence of Mr Lambeth because the account Mr Lambeth gave at the trial was inconsistent in a material respect with prior statements he had made. At the trial, Mr Lambeth’s evidence was that he had struck Mr Berecry in self-defence, because he believed that Mr Berecry was coming back through the door to hit him. However, in earlier statements made to the Club and Venue respectively, Mr Lambeth described his blow to Mr Berecry as being a reaction to a rapid and hostile move made by Mr Berecry towards Mr The. Mr Lambeth made a similar statement in the course of giving evidence in the prosecution in the Local Court. These prior inconsistent statements, especially the contradictory account given on oath, led his Honour to doubt the veracity of Mr Lambeth. 
      
       
     31 A statement made by Mr The was admitted into evidence at the trial. It supported Mr Lambeth’s earlier accounts of the incident because it described Mr Berecry as lunging towards Mr The. However, Mr The could not be located and he was not called to give evidence. 
      
       
     32 A number of photographs taken from a video that recorded some of the events during the incident were in evidence at the trial. They are somewhat equivocal in their depiction of the incident; on balance, however, they seem to support the accounts given by Messrs Baker, Carew and Cropper. Whilst standing outside the doors, Mr Berecry appears agitated, and at one instance, has his finger raised and pointing. Mr Lambeth appears on the inside of the doors, sometimes facing Mr Berecry and at least at one instance with his back to the doors. But when the doors are shown as re-opening, Mr Berecry appears to be coming through, with his arms at his side, towards Mr Lambeth who appears to be standing at a slight angle to the opening doors. 
      
       
     33 The contradictory accounts given on oath by Mr Lambeth, the non-availability of Mr The, and the video photographs all provide a credible basis for his Honour to have rejected their respective accounts of the incident in favour of the accounts given by Messrs Baker, Carew and Cropper which were consistent in their respective descriptions of Mr Berecry’s behaviour as he came back through the doors. There is no basis for concluding that his Honour failed to use or palpably misused the advantage which he had of seeing and hearing the witnesses (Abalos v Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167 at 178 - 179). His Honour’s finding that Mr Lambeth’s blow was intentional and unnecessary should not be disturbed. 
      
       
       Damages 
       
     34 The trial judge made two significant assessments of damages. He allowed $110,000 for general damages, based upon his finding that Mr Berecry suffers a permanent disability, manifested by loss of memory, depression (particularly in social situations), loss of taste, change in personality, and tiredness. His Honour also found that Mr Berecry, a motor mechanic, had a continuing economic incapacity, and his Honour allowed an average of $200 per week net until aged 65. After applying appropriate discounts, his Honour allowed $210,800 for future economic loss. 
      
       
     35 Both the Club and Mr Lambeth claim that the assessment of general damages is excessive. They claim that Mr Berecry had performed well at TAFE, that he had been able to live by himself, travel overseas, operate his own bank accounts, and generally lead a normal life. The trial judge accepted, however, that Mr Berecry suffers a permanent disability, and that the injury that he sustained had a major impact upon his quality of life and his capacity to function normally, although he is not physically disabled. Having regard to his Honour’s findings, his assessment of $110,000 for general damages does not appear to me to be manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     36 As to the issue of the assessment of future economic loss, a submission was made on behalf of Mr Lambeth that, based on Mr Berecry’s actual earnings at the relevant date and the actual earnings of other mechanics at his place of work, the proper assessment should have been between about $124,000 and $135,000, whereas his Honour assessed the figure at $210,800. The Club’s damages schedule suggested an allowance of $50,000 in this respect. In making his assessment, his Honour took into account Mr Berecry’s diminished productivity rate of 80% in comparison with other mechanics, and found that, although Mr Berecry has been employed to date by “sympathetic” employers, he would find it longer to regain employment than if he was unimpaired. Furthermore, his Honour took into account Mr Berecry’s ongoing tiredness, and that Mr Berecry would be unable to conduct his own repair business.  
      
       
     37 These are important findings that were open to his Honour on the evidence, and they form the basis for concluding that his Honour’s assessment of $210,800 for economic loss is not manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     38 In accordance with the reasons I have set out, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal both with costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: The circumstances giving rise to these appeals, and the issues they involve, are set out in the judgment of Simpson J, with which I agree. In this judgment, I propose to deal with Ground 3 in Mr. Taylor’s appeal. That ground is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The learned trial judge erred in granting the Crown leave pursuant to s.38 Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine the witness Douglas Crombie (pp.425-426, judgment 15.4.99). 
         
        
        
       The same ground is relied on in Mr. Michaels’ appeal. 
        
       
     2 This ground relates to events that took place during the Crown case. The Crown called as a witness one Douglas Crombie, whom the Crown alleged to be a co-conspirator with the three appellants. Mr. Crombie had previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, and had been given a discount on his sentence in return for agreeing to give evidence in the trial of the appellants. His evidence was to the following effect. 
      
       
     3 Mr. Crombie said he knew Mr. Taylor, and that he was introduced by Mr. Taylor to Mr. Reardon in July/August 1997, as somebody who had contacts who could deliver cocaine in South America. Mr. Reardon put a proposal to Mr. Crombie involving the importation of cocaine from Chile, with the reward to Mr. Crombie for organising the delivery of the cocaine to be 5 kilograms of the cocaine or its monetary equivalent.  
      
       
     4 Mr. Crombie approached his wife’s friend Lilly Villegas, who said she could organise the delivery of 50 kilograms of cocaine in Chile at a price of $6,000.00 per kilo. In one meeting with Mr. Reardon, Mr. Crombie handed over a gram of cocaine as a sample of the material he could obtain. He arranged with Mr. Reardon to travel to Chile in October 1997 to facilitate delivery of the cocaine; and he travelled to Chile with his sister-in-law, Haydee Martinez-Diaz, who spoke Spanish. Mr. Reardon, Mr. Crombie and Ms. Martinez-Diaz met in Santiago, Chile, and commenced making arrangements to obtain and transport 50 kilograms of cocaine to be concealed in a container load of wine. Pursuant to these arrangements, Mr. Crombie and Ms. Martinez-Diaz travelled from Santiago to Bolivia. Mr. Crombie later assisted in making arrangements for Lilly Villegas to come to Santiago to assist in obtaining delivery of the cocaine. 
      
       
     5 Mr. Crombie in evidence identified voices heard in a number of telephone intercepts, including telephone conversations between himself and Mr. Taylor.  
      
       
     6 Mr. Crombie was cross-examined first by Mr. Williams appearing for Mr. Reardon, then by Mr. Galvin appearing for Mr. Michaels, and finally by Mr. Watson appearing for Mr. Taylor. In cross-examination by Mr. Watson, Mr. Crombie agreed that Mr. Taylor had not assisted in relation to Mr. Crombie’s travel expenses to Chile. Mr. Crombie also agreed with Mr. Taylor’s Counsel that before meeting Mr. Reardon for the first time at the Tollgate Hotel, Mr. Taylor had not mentioned Mr. Reardon’s proposal to him.  
      
       
     7 At the conclusion of the cross-examination by Mr. Watson, the following exchange occurred:  
      
       
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, this is an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act, to cross-examine the witness on particular aspects of a prior statement made by him. I thought it best to raise it before we start rather than in the middle. Pursuant to s 38 and 39 of the Evidence Act it is our submission your Honour has the ability to permit cross-examination in re-examination where a witness has done anything of the things in s 38 (1) a, b, or c. And we contend that some of the evidence, on two particular aspects, the evidence that this witness has given is inconsistent with a prior statement made by him. 
          
          
         (Crown continued his application with reference to two matters. One being inconsistency relating to evidence on page 404 of the trial transcript about 7 or 8 lines down with reference to MFI 161 regarding Mr Crombie's discussion with Mr Taylor regarding air fares. He suggested that Mr Crombie's evidence appeared to either be misleading or be diametrically opposed with a statement he made 5 November 1998, paragraph 48. 
          
          
         The second matter referred to by the Crown related to a number of questions and answers commencing at the bottom of page 412 of the trial transcript which he suggested conflicted with a statement made by Mr Crombie on 24/2/1998, tendered on sentencing, which he handed up.) 
          
          
         MFI #A OF THE APPLICATION: STATEMENT OF MR CROMBIE OF 24 FEBRUARY 1998 
          
          
         (Crown drew Her Honour's attention to paragraph 8 submitting that in light of the inconsistencies with the evidence given by Mr Crombie, leave should be given to cross-examine regarding the inconsistencies.) 
         
        
       
     8 The primary judge gave the following judgment on this: 
      
       
        
         
         HER HONOUR: This is an application by the Crown for leave to cross-examine the witness Mr Crombie in the Crown case. The basis of the application is that the witness, Mr Crombie has given evidence which is unfavorable to the party calling him, he has given evidence about a matter which was within his knowledge and indeed is encompassed in a statement made by him on 24 February 1998 and he has made a prior inconsistent statement to the evidence that he gave. I am satisfied this is a proper case where the Crown has leave to cross-examine the witness in the course of re-examination about this matter and I grant leave. 
         
        
       
     9 There ensued a further exchange, recorded as follows in the transcript: 
      
       
        
         
         (Crown advised his re-examination would not be confined to those matters on which Her Honour had given him leave. Mr. Watson said he would require leave to cross-examine after the Crown. Discussion followed on s 38 of the Evidence Act with Her Honour saying that she did not regard failure to seek her leave before the cross-examination to be fatal to the application. Mr. Watson said there had been a time when the Crown could have assessed his witness as being unfavorable and made an application to Her Honour, to seek to rectify any problems that the Crown recognised at that time.) 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: Mr. Crombie was hardly a witness who was going to be forthcoming in his evidence in chief. 
          
          
         That's not your problem on this application but the Crown essentially put what is in that statement without the elaborations. What you have got Mr Crombie to say in cross-examination was there was an agreement prior to the meeting with Mr Reardon at the Novotel Hotel; that there had been no discussion other than Mr Taylor saying to him he knew people who could get diamonds, paintings, etcetera through the port, anything. That's what you have got out of your cross-examination, and successfully in your cross-examination. 
          
          
         WATSON: The point I'm trying to make is that the Crown has an obligation to recognise that the evidence coming out in chief is not up to the standard that they know can be available to their case. It's then that they make the application for leave to your Honour. 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: It's got to be more than not up to the standard. The Crown couldn't make this application if a witness didn't come up to proof. When they diverge significantly from the proof is when they can make the application. 
          
          
         WATSON: I would think there's an obligation on the Crown also to seek to elicit further evidence from their witness in chief. If the response appears to be diverging, then they have an obligation to their case to seek to adduce further evidence to rectify their position. 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: But it didn't diverge until your cross-examination. 
          
          
         WATSON: I can't be blamed for that. 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: No. In fact I think I congratulated you. 
          
          
         WATSON: If the Crown has a shortfall in their examination in chief, with respect, it's their problem.  
          
          
         HER HONOUR : I'm against you on that. I remain of the view that the Crown application falls squarely within section 38 but I will reserve that question until the end of the cross-examination in case it throws up something that requires it and I will hear you all on that but, so far as the application under 38 is concerned, I am against you on your application. 
          
          
         WATSON: On that point of further cross-examination, can I refer you to one authority, R v Milat, unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales on 22 April 1996. 
         
        
       
     10 In re-examination, the Crown Prosecutor showed Mr. Crombie a document, which Mr. Crombie acknowledged to have been a statement made by him on 5th November 1998, and bearing his signature at the bottom of each page. The Crown Prosecutor put to Mr. Crombie that he had said in that statement, in relation to a tape of a telephone intercept, the following: 
      
       
        
         
         I know the voices on that cassette to be Cliff Taylor and myself. In this conversation, Clifford Taylor and I discussed my air fare to South America and I request Clifford Taylor to organise my air fare and expenses and he confirms that he will arrange them. 
         
        
       
     11 However, in answer to further questions, Mr. Crombie gave evidence to the effect that Mr. Taylor did not in fact at any stage organise either the air fare or expenses for the trip, and that it appeared that the matter was taken no further after the conversation.  
      
       
     12 The Crown Prosecutor then put to Mr. Crombie the following further passages from another document, dated 24th February 1988 and also acknowledged to have been signed by Mr. Crombie: 
      
       
        
         
         In January 1997, Cliff Taylor told me that Allan Johnstone had put a proposition to him which involved a safe method of importing cocaine into Australia. Cliff Taylor and I discussed this matter further including plans to bring cocaine from South America to Australia by sea. On further discussions with Cliff, both of us thought it was unreasonable to become involved at that time. 
          
          
         Between February 1997 and July 1997, Cliff Taylor and I discussed the matter casually. During this time, Cliff Taylor told me that he had further discussions with Allan Johnstone about the possibility of proceeding with the importation. At that stage, I had no discussions with Allan Johnstone about the matter.  
          
          
         In July or August 1997, Cliff Taylor attended my house at Smithfield and told me that the person organising the proposed importation was currently in Chile in South America, and was unable to obtain the supply of cocaine. Cliff Taylor asked me if I had any contacts that could supply cocaine in Chile. Cliff Taylor stipulated that the cocaine must be available from Santiago in Chile.  
          
          
         I told Cliff Taylor that I had no contacts in Chile and that Chile was a very dangerous country to attempt drug dealings of any sort. Cliff Taylor knew that I was well associated with other South Americans due to the fact that I was married to a South American. 
          
          
         Cliff Taylor told me that he had arranged to meet his contact who was currently in Chile upon the contact’s return to Australia. I recall Cliff Taylor telling me around this time that Allan Johnstone had received facsimile messages from the person (contact in South America) regarding the plan to import cocaine to Australia. He also told me of the troubles they were having with the supply of the cocaine product from South America.  
          
          
         At this point in time, Cliff Taylor told me that he believed the proposition of importing the cocaine was achievable. Cliff Taylor asked me to investigate the possibility of obtaining a supply of cocaine to be made available for collection in Chile.  
         
        
       
     13 Mr. Crombie acknowledged that these statements were true, and that all of this occurred prior to him having met for the first time Mr. Reardon. There followed the following questions and answers: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Mr Crombie, that being so, could you tell me, please, how you were able to answer the question, ""So it was inconsequential chatter that you had with Taylor?"", when you were asked that question? 
          
         A. I can answer that by saying that at the time it wasn't a serious proposition and it was more based on fantasies. 
          
          
         Q. Whose fantasies? 
          
         A. Mine, Cliff's, anybody wants to make easy money. 
          
          
         Q. I see, it was a fantasy that there was someone in Chile, was it? 
          
         A. No, that's not a fantasy. 
          
          
         Q. It was a fantasy that you knew people apparently who were in the position to supply cocaine -was that a fantasy? 
          
         A. That was an unknown quantity. 
          
          
         Q. Was it a fantasy that you were the sort of person who would be interested in such a proposition? 
          
         A. To get involved personally at the time, it would have been not a fantasy but not a hot, a hot chance . 
          
          
         Q. Mr Crombie, did you answer many of the questions that were asked of you in cross-examination by Mr Watson with the view not to telling the precise truth but with a view to assisting Mr Taylor? 
          
          
         OBJECTION. (WATSON) .(PRECISENESS) . 
          
          
         HER HONOUR: Mr Crown, I think it probably falls outside the ambit of my leave. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: In that case, I have no further questions, if your Honour pleases. 
         
        
       
     14 The statement dated 5th November 1998 was marked MFI 195, and the statement dated 24th February 1998 was marked MFI 196: neither of them was tendered in evidence. 
      
       
        
       LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS 
       
     15 The relevant legislative provisions are ss.38 and 192 of the Evidence Act 1995, which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         38(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:  
          
         (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or  
          
         (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or  
          
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.  
          
         (2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39).  
          
         (3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness's credibility.  
          
         The rules about admissibility of evidence relevant only to credibility are set out in Part 3.7. 
          
         (4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs.  
          
         (5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs.  
          
         (6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account:  
          
         (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave, and  
          
         (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party.  
          
         (7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if:  
          
         (a) a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person, and  
          
         (b) the party is a witness in the proceeding. 
          
          
         192(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.  
          
         (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
          
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and  
          
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and  
          
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
          
         (d) the nature of the proceeding, and  
          
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.  
         
        
        
       SUBMISSIONS 
       
     16 Mr. Byrne SC for Mr. Taylor submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to properly exercise her discretion and in particular failing to take into account the matters referred to and required by s.192 of the Evidence Act. Mr. Byrne referred to Stanoevski v. The Queen [2001] HCA 4, 75 ALJR 454. Mr. Byrne submitted that leave to cross-examine the witness ought not to have been granted having regard to the matters referred to in s.192(2)(b) and (c), given that the effect was to diminish the impact of cross-examination of the witness, to bolster the credit and reliability of the witness (in terms of the consistency of the evidence with the Crown case) which, it was submitted (acknowledging the decision of the High Court in Adam v. The Queen [2001] HCA 57) must have a substantive probative value before it is permitted, and to unfairly diminish the evidence of the witness in so far as it did not assist the Crown case. It was unfair for the Crown simply to rely on s.38 in any trial to shore-up in re-examination a witness who is undermined, impeached or discredited in cross-examination. 
      
       
        
       DECISION 
       
     17 This matter raises the following questions:  
      
       
       (1) Did the trial judge fail to take into account matters required to be taken into account by s.38(6) and s.192?  
        
       (2) Did the trial judge make any other error of principle? 
        
       (3) Was the decision appealably wrong, because it was vitiated by some error of principle or so unreasonable that it could not properly have been reached on a proper application of correct principles? 
        
       (4) If error was shown, has the Crown established there was no miscarriage of justice? 
        
       
     18 The need to take into account the matters referred to in s.192 was the subject of considerable discussion by the High Court in Stanoevski. That case concerned the trial of a solicitor charged with conspiring with two other people to cheat and defraud an insurer of a sum of money. From the outset of the trial, it was apparent that the solicitor’s character would loom large in her defence. Her Counsel at an early stage of the trial informed the trial judge that evidence would be led of the appellant’s good character, whereupon the Crown Prosecutor foreshadowed that he would be relying on a report entitled “Preliminary Report by Investigator” to respond to such character evidence. The report was tendered and received on the limited basis that the trial judge might ascertain what it contained and understand how it might be used. The report purported to be a report of an investigation on behalf of the Law Society of New South Wales on an allegation that the solicitor had forged the signature of a client on documents to be filed in unrelated proceedings in the Family Court of Australia. Her Counsel objected to the use in any way of that material. After argument, the trial judge ruled that if the defence adduced evidence of good character, cross-examination of the solicitor would be permitted on the matters contained in the report. In giving reasons, the trial judge in that case noted the equivocal nature of matters in the report, and noted the objections by the solicitor’s Counsel, including the objection that the use of the report by the prosecutor would cause incurable unfair prejudice to his client and could well result with a trial within a trial over the issues raised. The trial judge continued:  
      
       
        
         
         The difficulty is this of course, that it is a matter for the accused whether she raises her good character in a positive way. If nothing is said the jury is entitled to assume that she is a person who doesn't have convictions. 
          
          
         The evidence thus far is that at the relevant time she was a practising solicitor, however, if she positively raises the fact of her good character then the Crown is left with this problem and I call it a problem because I would have thought he would be obliged to bring these matters to her notice. Seized, as it is, with the material in the file from the Law Society investigator, it seems to me the Crown would be obliged to put those matters to the accused and so far as the Court is concerned, although it may create some degree of prejudice to the accused, nonetheless the defence is aware of the situation and it is a matter for them whether they wish to take the step of the accused positively referring to good character. 
          
          
         It seems to be though that in all the circumstances the course is open to me to admit the cross-examination referred to if that eventuality arises. So I will have to reject Mr Skinner's application that that sort of cross-examination be forbidden. 
          
          
         Subject to further developments in the trial I would grant the leave to the Crown unless some other matter arises that would cause me to hold a different view. 
         
        
       
     19 All judges of the High Court held that s.192 applied to the exercise of discretion in this case, and that the requirements of s.192 had not been complied with.  
      
       
     20 The following passages appear in the judgment of Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ: 
      
       
        
         
         [41] Section 192 applies to this case, and in particular to the exercise by the trial judge of his or her discretion under s 112 of the Act. It should be noted that the leave required under s 112 is not leave to adduce evidence, but to cross-examine about the character of a defendant. In addition to matters which may be relevant in a particular case, in all cases the court must take into account the matters prescribed by s 192(2). It is clear here that the trial judge (probably because his attention does not seem to have been drawn to it) did not take into account all of those matters, some of which would inevitably have been relevant to the way in which his discretion ought to be exercised had he adverted to them.  
          
          
         [42] Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) were of importance here. As to par (a) a great deal of time was in fact taken up by the pursuit of a collateral issue, not just in cross-examination, but also in chief, addresses and the judge's summing up. Whether its pursuit added unduly to the length of the hearing was a matter to be taken into account and might well have affected his Honour's decision.  
          
          
         [43] The cross-examination on the report raised a very grave possibility of unfairness to the appellant within the meaning of s 192(2)(b). By giving permission for that cross-examination to take place the trial judge was allowing the undertaking of an extensive collateral inquiry by the prosecutor. That inquiry necessarily raised a contest of credibility between the appellant and her co-conspirator, Ms Wailes, on a matter on which the latter had not been cross-examined and upon which evidence neither in chief nor in cross-examination should have been led. The risk, in our opinion, indeed the certainty of unfairness, was compounded by the repeated references to signatures and some of the contents of documents which could not be admitted into evidence, were rightly rejected by the trial judge, and were not seen by the jury. An unfortunate example is a recitation by the prosecutor of the effect of part of the statutory declaration made by Ms Wailes and contained in the report. The repeated invitations to the appellant to speculate about Ms Wailes' actions and motivations in relation to the documents were similarly unfair. They also provide an example of the extent to which an attenuated attempt to rebut evidence of good character can be distracting from the main issues with which the jury should be concerned.  
          
          
         [44] Section 192 is not exhaustive as to the matters to be taken into account. Plainly the weight to be accorded to the evidence sought to be adduced, whether in cross-examination or otherwise, is a matter of considerable relevance. The trial judge quoted the expert's opinion in the report but yet does not seem to have taken into account how little, if any value it had, that is to say, its feather weight.  
          
          
         [45] The reasons and statutory basis for the report were not referred to in argument. It probably came into existence pursuant to Div 5 of Pt 10 of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) which does not require an investigator, or the Council of the Law Society of New South Wales or the Commissioner to do more than be satisfied of a reasonable likelihood of improper illegal conduct. It does not require an investigator to reach a firm conclusion that the subject of the investigation is in fact guilty.  
          
          
         [46] The opinion of the handwriting expert, was, as we have already pointed out, at best, equivocal and a person merely reading the statutory declarations of Ms Wailes, the alleged co-conspirator, as the author of the report did, without the benefit of cross-examination on them could hardly have been in a position to form any sound opinion of their reliability and to prefer claims made in them to the denials of the appellant. The author of the report nonetheless purported to be able to do this. Because the report and the material contained in it could be accorded little or no weight we do not think that it was a proper platform from which to attack the appellant's character in cross-examination. Another way of putting this is to say that the report was not important enough to be the subject of cross-examination within the meaning of s 
           
         192(2). That, coupled with the singularity of the event with which it dealt and its remoteness in time and difference in nature from the very serious charge levelled at the appellant also tended in our opinion to diminish the importance of the evidence that any cross-examination upon it might produce. 
          
          
         [47] It follows that matters of the kind which s 192(2) provides should be considered were of relevance to this case and to the trial judge's decision to permit the prosecutor to cross-examine as he did. In not taking properly these, and matters of weight and relevance into account, and in not therefore exercising his discretion in accordance with s 192 of the Act, the trial judge fell into error. There was, in our opinion, a further error in the trial judge's ruling. The possession by the prosecution of information of the kind contained in the report did not, as the trial judge held, ""oblige"" the prosecutor to put the subject matter of it to the appellant. Whether to use the material in the report was a matter for the prosecutor's own personal decision. Not to seek to use it, for the reasons we have stated, would have been an entirely proper one. The prosecutor however acted quite properly in seeking permission in advance here of the course he might take, and in subsequently acting in the way in which the trial judge said he was ""obliged"" to act.  
         
        
       
     21 McHugh J said the following: 
      
       
        
         
         [55] Section 192 of the Act directed the judge to have regard to certain matters in determining whether leave to cross-examine should be granted. However, his Honour, over the objection of the appellant's counsel, gave leave without considering these matters - indeed without being referred to them. Because that is so, the appellant was cross-examined in breach of the Act. Her trial was flawed by a ""wrong decision of any question of law"" within the meaning of s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
           
         (NSW). Her conviction cannot stand unless the prosecution can establish that her conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  
          
          
         [56] Two ways are open to the prosecution to show that no miscarriage of justice occurred. First, no miscarriage of justice occurred if the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant the prosecution leave to cross-examine the appellant on her claim of good character. Second, no miscarriage of justice occurred if the appellant would have been convicted even if leave to cross-examine had been refused.  
          
          
         [57] I think that it is likely that, if the judge had been referred to the matters in s 192, he would still have given leave to cross-examine the appellant on the matters in the report. But if he had refused to give leave, no one could say that his decision was unreasonable. Accordingly, the first ground for contending that no miscarriage occurred must fail. If the judge had been referred to s 192, he may or may not have granted leave to cross-examine on the matters in the investigator's report.  
          
          
         [58] The second ground for contending that no miscarriage of justice occurred must also be rejected. As counsel for the prosecution conceded in this Court, the appellant's good character was at the forefront of the case. The character evidence was more important than in many criminal cases because her case depended essentially on a denial of the evidence of an accomplice who had pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy with which the appellant was charged. The appellant's credibility was at the heart of her case. Any undermining of the evidence tending to establish that the appellant was of good character - evidence which the prosecution conceded was ""formidable"" - was likely to affect the jury's determination as to whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.  
          
          
         [59] As a result of the leave that the judge gave, the appellant conceded in cross-examination that, while acting in a Family Law matter, she may have purported to witness a signature on an affidavit when the signatory was not there. Indeed, prosecuting counsel put to her that she had forged the signature, an assertion that the appellant denied. The learned judge directed the jury that there was no evidence that the appellant had forged the signature. But he also directed the jury that, if they found that the appellant had purported to witness a signature when she had not done so, that could ""affect your assessment of her claim to be of good fame and character"".  
          
          
         [60] The cross-examination concerning the Family Law matter makes it impossible to find that the grant of leave to cross-examine on character did not result in a miscarriage of justice. There is a real chance that her credibility was undermined as the result of her concession about witnessing the affidavit, a concession that was obtained in breach of the Act.  
         
        
       
     22 Hayne J said this: 
      
       
        
         
         [67] It is enough to say that, in the course of argument at trial, attention was not directed to the operation of s 192 of the Act. The trial judge did not consider the several matters which that section required to be taken into account in exercising, as he did, the discretion under s 112 to give leave to the prosecutor to cross-examine the appellant about matters arising out of evidence given about her character. That discretion was, therefore, exercised without taking account of relevant considerations and the discretion miscarried. It cannot be said that the cross-examination which was allowed would inevitably have been permitted had the various matters referred to in s 192 been taken into account. It follows that it cannot be said that the appellant did not, as a result, lose a real chance of acquittal and, thus, this is not a case in which the proviso applies.  
         
        
       
     23 This case could be read as suggesting that a judge should, in all cases to which s.192 applies, expressly refer to the considerations set out in s.192(2); but for reasons I will give, I do not think this is a correct reading of the case.  
      
       
     24 In Stanoevski, in giving reasons, the trial judge said that, if the defendant raised her good character, the Crown would be “obliged” to put material in the file from the Law Society investigator to the defendant; and that, although this may create some prejudice to the defendant, it was a matter for her if she wished to raise good character. On that basis, he said he would grant leave to cross-examine if good character was raised, unless some other matter arose that would cause him to hold a different view. 
      
       
     25 In opposing leave at the trial in that case, the defendant’s Counsel submitted that use of the file in cross-examination would cause incurable unfair prejudice to the defendant and could result with a trial within a trial. Beyond referring to those submissions and a mention of “some prejudice”, the trial judge did not in his reasons advert to s.192 considerations. In the leading judgment in the High Court, Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ noted that by giving leave “the trial judge was allowing the undertaking of an extensive collateral enquiry by the prosecutor” in such circumstances as to give rise to “the risk, … indeed the certainty, of unfairness”, arising inter alia from references before the jury to the contents of documents which could not be admitted into evidence; and all this despite what their Honours called the “feather-weight” of the expert’s opinion in the file which was the basis of the cross-examination.  
      
       
     26 In those circumstances, there was a clear inference available that the trial judge in that case did not in fact consider the effect of granting leave on the length of the trial, the possible unfairness to the defendant, or the importance of the evidence; and I believe that all of the High Court judges drew that inference, correctly so in my respectful opinion. Nowhere in any of the judgments is it said that failure to refer explicitly to the matters mentioned in s.192 is itself an error of law; and I do not believe that any such opinion was intended. 
      
       
     27 I should add that I do not read the decision in R v. Esho [2001] NSWCA 415 as suggesting otherwise. In that case also, the trial judge gave reasons for his decision under s.38 which indicated that he did not regard the s.192 considerations as relevant. 
      
       
     28 A requirement that there must be express reference to the s.192 factors in all cases where s.192 applies would be far-reaching indeed. Section 192 applies to a court’s exercise of discretion in relation to very many matters which may arise frequently during the course of a trial. For example, it applies to each of the following: 
      
       
       (1) Direction permitting cross-examination of a witness before examination in chief has been completed, or permitting re-examination before all parties who wish to do so have completed cross-examination (s.28). 
        
       (2) Direction as to how a witness may be questioned (s.29(1)) or permitting the giving of evidence in narrative form (s.29(2)) or as to the way in which evidence is given in narrative form (s.29(3)).  
        
       (3) Grant of leave to a witness to use a document to revive memory in court (s.32(1)) or to read aloud such a document (s.32(1)), and directions to ensure production of relevant parts of such a document (s.32(4)).  
        
       (4) Directions as to the production of a document used to revive memory out of court (s.34(1)). 
        
       (5) Grant of leave to ask leading questions in examination-in-chief (s.37(1)), and directing that s.37(1) apply to certain classes of question (s.37(2)).  
        
       (6) Grant of leave to a party who calls a witness to cross-examine that witness (s.38(1)); grant of such leave to question about matters only relevant to credibility (s.38(3)); directions as to the timing of such cross-examination (s.38(4)) and as to the order of questioning the witness (s.38(5)). 
        
       (7) Grant of leave to ask questions in re-examination about matters not arising from cross-examination (s.39). 
        
       (8) Directing a witness not to answer a question (s.42(1)).  
        
       (9) Directions as to the use of a document recording prior statements (s.45(3) and (6)). 
        
       (10) Grant of leave to recall a witness (s.46(1)). 
        
       (11) Direction that paragraphs of s.48 apply to a document in a foreign country (s.49)(b)). 
        
       (12) Direction that a party may adduce evidence of the contents of documents in a summary form (s.50(1)). 
        
       (13) Directions that ss.63(2), 64(2) and/or 65(2), (3) and (8) (exceptions to the hearsay rule) apply despite a party’s failure to give notice of intention to adduce the evidence in question (s.67(4)). 
        
       (14) Direction that the tendency rule is not to apply despite a party’s failure to give notice under s.97 (s.101) or that the coincidence rule is not to apply despite a party’s failure to give notice under s.98 (s.102). 
        
       (15) Grant of leave to cross-examine a defendant in criminal proceedings about a matter relevant only to the defendant’s credibility (s.104(2)). 
        
       (16) Grant of leave to adduce evidence of a prior consistent statement (s.108(3)(b)). 
        
       (17) Grant of leave to cross-examine a defendant in criminal proceedings about evidence about the defendant’s character (s.112). 
        
       (18) Direction that a witness answer a question objected to on the ground of self-incrimination (s.128(5)). 
        
       (19) Direction that information or documents not be adduced as evidence, on the ground of public interest (s.130(1)). 
        
       (20) (Probably) direction limiting the use to be made of evidence (s.136). 
        
       (21) Grant of leave to make a request relating to a representation after expiry of the 21 day period referred to in s.168(1) (s.168(2)). 
        
       (22) Direction that a document be impounded (s.188). 
        
       (23) Grant of leave to state an agreed fact orally rather than in writing (s.191(3)(b)). 
        
       (24) Grant of permission to publish certain questions (s.195). 
        
       
     29 It is apparent from this list that many of these matters can arise quite frequently and unexpectedly during the course of a hearing, and will require immediate resolution, generally without extensive argument. Some of course may be highly significant and controversial, and may be decided only after extensive argument, for example some cases of items (6), (15), (17) and (18); but for the majority of matters, this will not be so.  
      
       
     30 In my opinion, unless the contrary may be inferred from the circumstances or from what a judge does say, it should be assumed that a judge hearing a case will continually be having regard, in making such decisions as in the judge’s other acts and omissions during the course of the hearing, to: 
      
       
       (a) the effect of the decision, act or omission on the length of the hearing, and how that in turn affects the legitimate interests of the parties and the efficient conduct of the court’s business;  
        
       (b) the imperative to avoid unfairness to parties and witnesses; 
        
       (c) the importance of any piece of evidence about which some discretion is to be exercised;  
        
       (d) the nature of the proceedings themselves; and 
        
       (e) the available alternatives, whether they be by way of orders or adjournments or otherwise; 
        
       that is, to the matters referred to in s.192(2). 
        
       
     31 These are all matters normally uppermost in a judge’s mind throughout the conduct of a first instance hearing, and it would be strange indeed that there should be a legislative requirement that they be articulated on every occasion when there is leave or permission granted or a direction given under the Evidence Act. To require a bald incantation of regard to the section or to the items referred to would be to promote an empty formality; while to require reasoned discussion of each item on every occasion would be absurdly onerous and productive of delay and injustice. 
      
       
     32 The obligation to give reasons requires reasons sufficient to understand the substantive basis of a decision, not reference to every matter taken into account: cf. R. v. Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 236-7.  
      
       
     33 In this case, this Court must decide whether the trial judge erred in deciding that the requirements of s.38(1) were satisfied, whether matters in s.38(6) were not taken into account, and whether matters referred to in s.192 were not taken into account.  
      
       
     34 Her Honour found that the circumstances were within s.38(1)(a) and (c), and no challenge is brought to that finding. As to s.38(6), the problem arose out of the last cross-examination of the witness, so it appears that in substance notice was given at the earliest time, and it was open in any event to the other parties to apply for further cross-examination. This matter was not discussed prior to the judgment or in the judgment itself, but it was obvious and did not necessarily have to be stated. In any event, it was canvassed in the discussion after the judgment, following which the trial judge adhered to her decision. 
      
       
     35 Turning to the matters referred to in s.192, it is apparent that the leave did not significantly affect the length of the case, and that it was not likely to do so: the failure to expressly advert to that consideration does not suggest that the primary judge did not have that consideration in mind, in this as in all directions and exercises of judgment made by her during the course of the trial.  
      
       
     36 The question whether granting leave to cross-examine would be unfair to a party or a witness was an extremely important consideration, but again that is a consideration normally uppermost in a trial judge’s mind in every action taken during the trial. The circumstances do not suggest any significant possibility of unfairness, so again the failure explicitly to advert to that question does not suggest to me that the question of unfairness was not taken into account. The same applies to the question of the importance of the evidence.  
      
       
     37 Finally, there is absolutely no reason to suppose that the trial judge did not have in mind at all times in her conduct of the trial the nature of the case which she was hearing, or the relevant alternatives available to her.  
      
       
     38 For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the trial judge failed to take into account matters required to be taken into account by s.38(6) and s.192. Nor am I satisfied that there was any other error of principle. Furthermore, I do not think the decision was an unreasonable one: it permitted a fuller and not unfair picture to be given to the jury about what Mr. Crombie was able to say about relevant matters, while at the same time suggesting elements of unreliability in Mr. Crombie’s evidence which were not unfavourable to the appellants Taylor and Michaels, thereby adding weight to the scepticism with which the jury could be expected to have approached Mr. Crombie’s evidence, in accordance with the trial judge’s direction as to how they should approach the evidence of an accomplice. Indeed, by reason of these considerations, if, contrary to the view I have expressed, there was an error in failing to expressly refer to s.192, I am satisfied that it occasioned no miscarriage of justice. The decision to allow this cross-examination was a reasonable and appropriate exercise of discretion, having regard to the s.192 consideration; and in any event could not reasonably be considered to have affected Mr. Taylor’s or Mr. Michaels’ chances of acquittal. 
      
       
     39 For those reasons, in addition to those given by Simpson J, I would dismiss the appeals against conviction of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Michaels. For the reasons given by Simpson J, I would dismiss the appeals of Mr. Reardon against his conviction. 
      
       
     40 As regards the applications for leave to appeal against sentence, I agree with Barr J. 
      
       
     41 SIMPSON J: On 22 March 1999 the appellants were jointly indicted on a charge that, during 1997, they conspired with each other, and with other named individuals, to import into Australia not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, contrary to s233B of the Customs Act 1904. Each entered a plea of not guilty and a trial proceeded. On 11 May the jury returned a verdict of guilty against each appellant. The quantity of the drug alleged by the Crown to have been the subject of the conspiracy was 50 kg. The maximum penalty applicable to the offence is imprisonment for life.  
      
       
     42 On 22 June 1999 the judge sentenced the appellants. As finally formulated the sentences were as follows: 
      
       
       Reardon 
       : imprisonment for seventeen years and eleven months, commencing 23 April 1999, with a non-parole period of fourteen years: 
        
       Michaels 
       : imprisonment for twenty years commencing 21 November 1995 with a non-parole period of sixteen years; 
        
       Taylor 
       : imprisonment for twelve years commencing 21 November 1997 with a non-parole period of ten years. 
        
       
     43 Each appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him.  
      
       
        
       THE CROWN CASE 
       
     44 The Crown alleged that the conspiracy originated in early 1997. At that time Reardon reached an agreement with another conspirator, Ian Cox, to import 50 kg of cocaine to Australia from Chile. Cox was the proprietor of a wine importing business which was to be used as the vehicle for the importation. Concurrently, Taylor was introduced by an acquaintance, Allan Johnstone, to a man called Douglas Crombie. In January 1997 these two men had a conversation about another man who was said to be able “to get things through the port”. Conversations along these lines continued over several months, and eventually Taylor told Crombie that the people to whom he had referred were looking for cocaine. In July or August Taylor introduced Crombie to Reardon. At a meeting between Reardon, Crombie and Taylor, Reardon said that he knew people who were looking to finance a cocaine importation. The role he proposed for Crombie (to which Crombie agreed) was to locate a drug supplier in Chile. Crombie recruited Lily Villegas, who two days later agreed to obtain the required amount of cocaine, for the price offered, saying that she knew a supplier in Santiago.  
      
       
     45 Subsequent meetings took place between Crombie and Reardon, and Crombie and Taylor and others. On one occasion Crombie supplied Reardon with one gram of cocaine, and said (falsely) that a kilogram was available. Reardon sought the help of Allan Dillon in obtaining a loan of $20,000. He confided in Dillon that the reason he needed the money was to finance a drug importation. Dillon was not able or willing to advance the money himself, but approached another person, W. Dillon and W arranged to meet each other and Reardon at a suburban hotel. Having effected the introductions, Dillon absented himself from the conversation that ensued and had no further involvement in the matter. 
      
       
     46 W, however, was a registered informant of the NSW Crime Commission. He reported Reardon’s approach to an officer of the National Crime Authority (“NCA”). Michael Purchas, an officer of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) then on secondment to the NCA, assumed supervision of the operation that was devised to investigate and monitor W’s reports. Warrants to intercept W’s telephone calls, and to use listening devices to record conversations, were obtained. The meeting between W and Reardon took place on 11 June, at the suburban hotel already mentioned, and was tape recorded pursuant to a warrant issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984. On the Crown case this was the first meeting between the two. (Reardon claimed, to the contrary, that he had previously met W, and had discussed a drug importation.) The conversation recorded was, on the Crown case, incriminating, and established Reardon’s involvement in the conspiracy.  
      
       
     47 W continued to have regular contact, both by telephone and in person, with Reardon. On each occasion, the conversation was recorded. In July he acted as a conduit between the NCA and Reardon to provide Reardon with an airline ticket for travel to and from Chile, and the sum of $2,820 in Australian currency; and an Australian $10 note cut in a zig zag pattern. This, W explained to Reardon, was to identify him to the Chilean contact Reardon was to meet in Santiago. 
      
       
     48 In a meeting with W on 23 September Reardon gave W a sample of what he said was cocaine. This was analysed and proved indeed to be cocaine, of 85 per cent purity. This, presumably, was the sample he had been given by Crombie.  
      
       
     49 On two occasions, in July and October 1997, Reardon travelled to Chile, the purpose being to obtain the cocaine. Crombie and Cox also travelled to Chile, Cox to arrange the wine shipment in which the drug was to be concealed, Crombie to arrange to take delivery of the drug. For this purpose he was accompanied by his Spanish speaking sister-in-law, Haydee Martinez-Diaz. Crombie was also to liaise with Reardon in Chile and for this purpose was given the soubriquet “Jungle Bunny” or “JB”. Whilst in Chile, Reardon was introduced to a man he came to know as “Oscar”, and who, purportedly, represented individuals who were to finance the transaction. “Oscar” was, in fact, Oscar Alvarez, an undercover Chilean police officer. No purchase of cocaine was finalised on either occasion. In August, after the first trip to Chile, Reardon returned to Australia, and continued to meet W, and others, with a view to furthering the agreement.  
      
       
     50 Using the name “Mike”, Purchas posed as a person involved in financing the importation, and maintained contact with Reardon. In a telephone conversation with Purchas on 16 November (when Reardon was in Chile) Reardon mentioned the name “Edgar” (Michaels) and gave Purchas a telephone number. Thereafter on that and the following two days, Purchas and Michaels spoke on the telephone, and met on two occasions. Michaels, also a Spanish speaker, was involved as potentially an alternative to Crombie in arranging the purchase of the cocaine in Santiago. As it happened, Reardon decided to use Crombie rather than Michaels for that purpose although it seems that Michaels was actively involved, and awaiting instructions from Reardon. 
      
       
     51 In September, again acting as a conduit for the NCA, W handed Reardon $600 in cash and an airline ticket for travel to Chile. On 1 October, still acting on behalf of the NCA, W handed Reardon $1,500. 
      
       
     52 Taylor, Cox and Crombie flew to Chile, Taylor leaving Sydney on 6 October, Cox on 10 October, and Crombie on 13 October. Reardon left on 10 October. He met “Oscar”, who also was in contact with Crombie. 
      
       
     53 The NCA provided $US6,000 cash, which “Oscar” placed in a safety deposit box. $US375,000 had already been placed in a safety deposit box to enable “Oscar” to purport to demonstrate that the necessary finance was available. 
      
       
     54 On 21 November, on his return to Sydney Airport from his second trip to Chile, Reardon was arrested. He was in possession of $2,900 in US currency, certain items associated with wine bottling, and part of the previously partly severed Australian $10 note. On the same day Cox, Taylor and Michaels were also arrested. When interviewed, Michaels claimed to have been working for a Gordon Elliott, an AFP agent who had previously been on secondment to the NCA. Federal Agent Elliot acknowledged having met Michaels, in the presence of Michaels’ solicitor, on two occasions, but denied having any working relationship with him.  
      
       
        
       THE DEFENCE CASES 
       
     55 Each appellant gave evidence. Reardon acknowledged the various conversations attributed to him, but claimed that what purported to be his participation in the agreement was no more than, in reality, an attempt by him to defraud W by obtaining his money. This he was to do by pretending to engage in the conspiracy. Generally speaking, there was no factual dispute about what the Crown alleged he had done and said. There was, however, one significant divergence between the evidence Reardon gave and that given in the Crown case. Reardon claimed that he had met W on one occasion before the tape recorded meeting of 11 June, and that on this occasion, which was not recorded, W had initiated the discussion about investing money in a drug importation. Apart from that, the issue for the jury was whether the conversations should be interpreted as inculpatory, as contended by the Crown, or innocent, as contended by Reardon – ie whether it was reasonably possible that Reardon’s apparent participation was, as he claimed, no more than a sham. 
      
       
     56 According to Reardon, nobody else knew that he was not a genuine participant.  
      
       
     57 Taylor’s defence involved a simple denial of involvement. He acknowledged that he was acquainted with Reardon and Crombie, and others, and that he had spoken to them on the phone on many occasions. When asked about the contents of tape recorded conversations which appeared to be incriminating he simply said that he did not know what was meant. 
      
       
     58 Michaels’ evidence was that in 1996 he became involved in an enterprise recycling paper or cardboard, and that all of his discussions recorded on tape to which the Crown pointed as evidence of involvement in drugs were properly explained by reference to this enterprise. He elicited some support for this claim through the evidence of Beatrice Grana, his girlfriend, who asserted that the two had commenced such a business. She produced some correspondence to support her claim. 
      
       
     59 It will be necessary to expand this already lengthy outline of the facts when considering the various grounds of appeal.  
      
       
        
        
       THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL 
       
     60 Initially four men (the three appellants and Cox) were indicted. A jury was empanelled on 1 March 1999. Before any evidence was taken, it emerged that Cox had applied for, and been refused, legal aid. He had appealed against the refusal and the appeal had not been determined. Section 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 accordingly required that the trial, so far as it concerned him, be stayed. 
      
       
     61 The jury was discharged in respect of all four accused, and a new trial fixed to commence on 22 March. On that day, as Cox remained unrepresented, he was granted an adjournment of the proceedings against him. A jury was empanelled to determine the charges against the three appellants. On that day the Crown Prosecutor opened the case, but no evidence was taken on that day. The following day one member of the jury failed to attend. The next day, 24 March, in circumstances to be explored in more detail below, that juror was discharged, and the trial proceeded with a jury of eleven. The decisions to discharge one juror, and to proceed with eleven, are the bases for some of the grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of Reardon. 
      
       
     62 The first witness was Allan Dillon. His role, as is evident from the outline above, was significant, but limited. He spoke of an approach to him by Reardon, concerning a proposed drug importation, of his own approach to W, and of his introduction of W and Reardon.  
      
       
     63 The next witness was W. (His correct name was disclosed to the jury, but a non-publication order has since been made and continued.) W disclosed a past criminal history that included a number of counts of fraud and other forms of dishonesty, escaping lawful custody, and a drug (amphetamines) conviction. In relation to certain Queensland charges, he said that, by reason of assistance he had given to the NSW Crime Commission and the NCA in respect of a prosecution of a former employer, he had received “a letter of comfort”. As a result the sentences that otherwise would have been imposed were reduced. He said he had become a registered informant of the NSW Crime Commission about the beginning of 1997. He said he had been approached by Dillon concerning a possible drug importation, and that, after initially refusing to participate, he had reported the matter to his contact in the NCA. He said that, on NCA encouragement, he arranged a meeting with Dillon, and subsequently, a meeting between himself, Dillon and Reardon. In large part the evidence given by W consisted of tape recordings of conversations the contents of which were not in issue (save as appears below). 
      
       
     64 In cross-examination W agreed that, in a NSW prosecution on a number of charges of obtaining benefits by deception, the sentences imposed had been suspended. He had received a similar benefit in the Queensland Supreme Court. The impact of these circumstances on the assessment of W’s credibility, and the appropriate directions to assist the jury to make that assessment, are raised by some of the grounds of appeal, and will be considered below. 
      
       
     65 A small hiccup occurred during the course of W’s evidence. Since virtually all of his dealings and conversations with Reardon were recorded, a large number of tape recordings were tendered during his evidence in chief. Certain of these had, by agreement between the parties, been edited to eliminate irrelevant or inadmissible material. The jury was provided with transcripts of the tape recording which they were told (conventionally) were to assist in understanding the tapes, but were not to substitute for the tapes in the event of any detected or observed discrepancy. On 29 March, by inadvertence, an unedited version of an edited tape was played to the jury. The mistake was discovered immediately. Counsel for Reardon unsuccessfully sought to have the jury discharged. This incident gives rise to one of the grounds of appeal advanced on Reardon’s behalf. 
      
       
     66 Evidence was also given by Paul Fehon, an investigator with the NCA; by Purchas; by other NCA officers; and by Douglas and Cynthia Crombie; Haydee Martinez-Diaz (Cynthia Crombie’s sister); Lily Villegas; and three Chilean police officers, Rodrigo Ibinarriaga, Juan Guiterrez, and Oscar Alvarez. 
      
       
     67 Douglas and Cynthia Crombie and Haydee Martinez-Diaz had themselves been charged for their part in the conspiracy, but had entered pleas of guilty to charges of conspiring to import cocaine. They were sentenced by Shillington DCJ on 1 May 1998. Each received a significant benefit in the sentence imposed by reason of cooperation in the investigation and the agreement to give evidence against the present three appellants and Cox. A sentence of fifteen years, which would otherwise have been imposed on Douglas Crombie was, by reason of his substantial assistance to the authorities in the prosecution of the appellants, reduced to one of eight years with a non-parole period of five years. Similar reductions were given in the sentences imposed on Cynthia Crombie and Martinez-Diaz. 
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
     68 The grounds of appeal against conviction were framed as follows: 
      
       
       REARDON  
        
         
         1 The trial miscarried. 
          
         2 The trial judge erred in:

       REARDON’S CONVICTION APPEAL  
        
       1. Jury issues (grounds 2 and 3) 
       
     71 On behalf of Reardon, a number of matters concerning the jury, involving two separate aspects of the trial, were raised. The first of these concerns the discharge of one juror, and a decision to proceed with eleven jurors, at a stage of the trial at which no evidence had been taken. A short outline of what then occurred has been given above, but it is necessary now to expand that account. 
      
       
     72 The jury was empanelled on Monday 22 March 1999. The trial was then estimated to occupy about three months. The transcript records that the Crown Prosecutor then opened the case to the jury. At the conclusion of the Crown opening the jury was released for the day. 
      
       
     73 The following morning, in the absence of the jury, the trial judge advised that she had received a message that one of the jurors was ill and would not be in attendance that day. There was some discussion at that stage about the anticipated duration of the juror’s absence, and whether the trial should proceed with only eleven jurors. 
      
       
     74 There was also some discussion about a communication from another juror concerning possible acquaintance with one of the appellants, but this was resolved and is immaterial to the grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     75 Since the absent juror appears to have indicated that she had rung whilst on her way to seek medical attention, and that she would ring again after she had received that attention, it was agreed that no decision should be made until further information was available. Eventually, having heard no more from the absent juror, the trial judge released the rest of the jury for the remainder of the day. 
      
       
     76 On the third day, Wednesday 24 March, the court again re-convened in the absence of the jury. On this occasion the judge advised that a letter had been received from the absent juror together with a bundle of material which, the transcript records, was marked for identification with the number 2. 
      
       
     77 On the hearing of the appeal a bundle of documentation was provided to this court which, it was generally agreed, was probably (although not certainly) the material marked for identification 2. This consisted of a medical certificate dated 23 March, certifying that the juror was unfit for duty until 6 April – a period of two weeks. Also contained in the material was a hand written letter addressed to the presiding judge. The photocopy provided contains no signature, but this is probably explained by the fact that, during the course of discussion, it was noted that the juror’s name was on the document and the judge stated her intention to have a photocopy made and the name obliterated. This was for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the legislative intention to maintain the privacy and anonymity of those required to perform jury duty. (see, for example, Jury Act 1977, ss 29,37.) 
      
       
     78 Attached to the letter was a typewritten document apparently emanating from the juror’s employment, and expressing concern about the detrimental effect a lengthy period of absence for jury duty would have upon the business in which the juror was employed. 
      
       
     79 Finally, there was a statutory declaration, again with the name of the declarant obliterated, but which, it may confidently be inferred, was made by the juror. 
      
       
     80 The first mentioned letter commenced with a request that the juror “be dismissed from Jury Duty”. The author stated that she was employed as accountant/financial controller for a small private company which was having severe cash flow problems and needed daily monitoring. That, she said, was part of her function.  
      
       
     81 She went on to say that she suffered from migraine precipitated by stress and that on her return on the first day of the trial after being empanelled she became very ill because she did not believe she could perform her duty for the twelve weeks’ anticipated duration of the trial. She said she was still suffering from migraine on Tuesday and was unable to perform her duties. She referred again to the detrimental effect of absence from her employment and said she believed that her health would “quickly deteriorate” and she would be unable fairly to perform her duty. 
      
       
     82 Much the same kind of material was contained in the statutory declaration. 
      
       
     83 All of this was divulged to all counsel, in the absence of the remainder of the jury. The transcript records that the judge stated her view that: 
      
       
        
         
         … it doesn’t make sense for a three months trial to have someone who doesn’t want to be there. 
         
        
        
       Her Honour advised that she had made some enquiries about commencement of a new trial if the whole of the jury were discharged. She had been told that, in relation to the jury panels summoned for the following Monday, the longest projected trial was six weeks but there was no certainty that even that panel would be available for this trial. No other jury panels had been warned to prepare themselves for a lengthy trial. 
        
       
     84 Her Honour also observed that she had proposed to take two weeks’ leave in June, of which she was prepared to sacrifice one week, but during one of which she had commitments she could not abandon. 
      
       
     85 The Crown Prosecutor then suggested that the juror should be discharged, saying: 
      
       
        
         
         It wouldn’t be just to allow the juror to remain on the jury. And you have no choice but to discharge that juror. 
         
        
       
     86 Her Honour asked what should happen after that, noting that another panel would not be available until 12 April. The Crown Prosecutor urged that the trial proceed with eleven jurors. 
      
       
     87 Counsel for Reardon opposed proceeding with a jury of only eleven. When asked to explain the grounds of his objection he said: 
      
       
        
         
         On the basis that the trial in essence hasn’t started really started. It is a long trial. It is a serious trial and he is entitled to have the full quota of jurors. 
         
        
       
     88 Counsel for the other two accused both agreed to proceed with a jury of eleven. It may here be observed that both Michaels and Taylor had been in custody, refused bail, for sixteen months. Reardon had the benefit of a grant of bail. 
      
       
     89 Following this discussion the juror was brought into court, and sworn. She did not give any evidence additional to that contained in the documents marked for identification 2, except to acknowledge that, the previous afternoon at about 2.00 pm, she had been located by the sheriff’s officer at work – thus casting some doubt on her claim of illness. 
      
       
     90 The judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         You may step down. You are excused from further attendance. 
          
         
        
       
     91 Directly addressing counsel for Reardon, the judge noted his application for the discharge of the entire jury, and stated that she had considered the terms of the Jury Act and heard submissions from the other parties. She said she took into account the further delay that would be occasioned in obtaining another panel sufficient to enable the constitution of a jury, that delay being until 12 April; and that the two co-accused were in custody and had been for some time. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         In all of the circumstances I do not propose to discharge the jury but propose to continue with eleven. 
          
         
        
       
     92 She then stated her intention of giving some directions to the remaining members of the jury, which she did, telling them that the trial would proceed with eleven jurors. 
      
       
     93 The applicable statutory provisions are ss 19 and 22 of the Jury Act which are relevantly in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         19 The jury in any criminal proceedings in … the District Court is to consist of twelve persons returned and selected in accordance with this Act. 
          
          
         22 Where in the course of any trial … any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court … whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial … properly constituted if - 
          
          (a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members - 
           
           (i) is not reduced below 10; 
            
           (ii) is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused; or 
            
           (iii) is reduced below ten but not below eight and the trial has been in progress for at least two months; 
           
          (b) … 
           
          (c ) … 
          
         and if the court … so orders 
         . (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     94 It is of some importance to note that there were in fact two separate decisions made by the trial judge. The first was the decision to discharge the individual juror. The second was the decision to proceed with a jury of eleven, rather than aborting the trial, discharging the remainder of the jury, and fixing a new trial date. Both decisions are the subject of criticism on behalf of Reardon. The only criticisms advanced in relation to the first decision made reference to that part of the discussion in which the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         It doesn’t make sense for a three months trial to have someone who doesn’t want to be here. 
         
        
       
     95 Further, it was submitted that no sufficient reason for the discharge of the juror had been disclosed, the trial judge having confined her explanation for her decision to the juror’s “dislike of performing jury service”. This, it was said, was an insufficient reason for the discharge. 
      
       
     96 Section 22 confers a very broad power or discretion in relation to the discharge of individual jurors: see generally Wu v R [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99. The section inherently recognises that such discharge might occur where a juror is “through illness incapable of continuing to act”, but broadens that scope by the addition of the words “or for any other reason”. However, it may well be correct to say that a stated dislike of performing jury service, with no more, would be inadequate to justify the exercise of the discretion. It is unnecessary further to consider that, because it is far from what the evidence discloses was before the judge. True, during the course of discussion, the judge expressed the view that it did not make sense, in a lengthy trial, to have an unwilling juror, and did not give explicit reasons for the decision to discharge that juror. However, even leaving aside the validity of the juror’s expressed concern about her employment, the medical evidence was compelling, and, in my opinion, decisive. This is so notwithstanding the doubt cast upon that evidence by the circumstance that the juror was in fact found to be at work on the Tuesday afternoon. The medical certificate required that the juror be excused from service until 6 April. Unless that medical evidence was to be challenged (and it was not) it left the judge with no alternative. She could not have kept the remaining members of the jury unoccupied for the period encompassed by the medical certificate; that was particularly so when the trial had barely begun. That makes it unnecessary to consider whether the circumstances relating to the juror’s employment would have justified the decision to discharge her. The first decision, that is, the decision to discharge the individual juror, is, in my opinion, unassailable. 
      
       
     97 Occasionally it will happen that an individual, such as (perhaps) this juror, will confront the system. It is one thing to maintain that it is the duty of every citizen to perform jury duty and it is no doubt tempting, at times, to seek to enforce that principle. But it is equally important never to lose sight of the important function that jurors are called upon to perform. Inherent in that function is a willingness to forgo, or put to one side, personal interest. Where a juror cannot or will not do that, he or she cannot be compelled. Only physical attendance can be compelled; the heart and mind cannot. The reality here was that this juror was not suited to the task, and no amount of compulsion was going to make her turn her mind to the task. Unpalatable as it may be to see the disrespect for the system implicit in the juror’s conduct, justice mandated that the juror be released from service in the trial. Any other course would potentially have worked unfairness to one party or another. In my opinion the judge had no alternative other than to act as she did. 
      
       
     98 The second decision was the decision to proceed with a jury of eleven. The only alternative was to discharge the entire jury and commence a fresh trial when a suitable jury panel was available. In this respect it is of great significance that the two co-accused who sought continuation of the trial had been in custody for many months.  
      
       
     99 On behalf of Reardon it was submitted that error could be discerned in the decision-making process in a number of ways. Firstly, it was submitted, the trial judge appeared to have given little or no consideration to the common law principle that an accused should ordinarily be tried by a jury of twelve, unless a juror is (or jurors are) discharged for good and sufficient reason; and that, equally, no or inadequate consideration was given to the provisions of s19 of the Jury Act. Counsel referred to the decision of this court in R v Radju [2001] NSWCCA 103, unreported, 19 March 2001.  
      
       
     100 The principle referred to may readily be accepted. However, it is not absolute. Once it is also accepted (as I do accept) that the position of the two co-accused was not only a relevant consideration, but one entitled to considerable weight, the argument loses a great deal of force. The Jury Act expressly envisages that a trial may proceed with less than the prima facie number of jurors, even over the opposition of the person(s) on trial. Here the judge had a number of factors to balance, and I am satisfied that she was entirely correct in assigning greater weight to the desirability of the trial proceeding, the minimisation of further delay, and the wishes of the two accused who remained in custody, than to the wish of Reardon to be tried by a jury of twelve. 
      
       
     101 Reliance was also placed upon the reference by the trial judge to her own personal commitments, it being suggested that she gave some weight to this circumstance. I would reject this proposition. The reference by her Honour to her proposed leave was no more than an observation concerned with the various potential consequences of a full jury discharge. 
      
       
     102 The decision to proceed with a reduced number of jurors is a discretionary one requiring the weighing of a number of competing considerations. The desire of one co-accused to be tried by a jury of twelve members is one, but only one, of those considerations. 
      
       
     103 In oral submissions in this court it was argued that a further alternative was the discharge of the jury in relation to Reardon, and the separation of his trial from that of the two co-accused. Adoption of this course would have meant that the preferences of all accused were met. Such a suggestion was never made to the trial judge, and the possibilities were not canvassed. However, this being a conspiracy trial, it is obvious that it was desirable that as many co-accused be tried together as possible. It had already been necessary to separate the trial of Cox by reason of his lack of legal representation. 
      
       
     104 Indeed, this gave rise to a suggestion that the judge:  
      
       
        
         
         may well have been influenced by the fact that she had recently on 22 March, 1999 (sic) had to discharge the jury in the same matter. 
         
        
       
     105 I would reject this submission. There is no inkling in the transcript that this circumstance had any bearing on the decision to proceed with a jury of eleven. Even if it had been a factor, I am not persuaded that it would necessarily have been erroneous. The fact of delays that had already occurred was certainly a relevant factor, the weight of which depended upon the degree of risk of unfairness (if any) of proceeding with a jury of only eleven. 
      
       
     106 In my opinion no error has been disclosed in the judge’s reasoning towards the decision to proceed with a jury of eleven, or in the evidence of that discussion. 
      
       
     107 Counsel for Reardon also raised two arguments which may reasonably be labelled “technical”. The first of these was that s22 of the Jury Act requires, before a trial proceeds with a jury of less than twelve, that an order to that effect be made. It was argued that, although the judge stated her intention of so proceeding, she did not, in terms, make an order. A similar argument was put concerning the discharge of the juror (although it is difficult to see show the terms of s22 permit a construction that requires such an “order”). 
      
       
     108 In Wu Gleeson CJ and Hayne J accepted that an order under s22 might be made by implication: [8]. See also Radju  [26]. 
      
       
     109 In the present case I do not think it is necessary to resort to that principle. Section 22 does not prescribe any particular form of words by which either the discharge of an individual juror, or an order to proceed with less than the otherwise prescribed number, is to be made. At the conclusion of her exchange with the juror, the trial judge expressly said that the juror was excused from further attendance. In my opinion that was adequate to meet the requirements of s22 in relation to that decision. In relation to the second matter, her Honour stated that she proposed to continue with eleven. Again, in my view, that is sufficient compliance with s22. In other words, I am satisfied that an appropriate statement was made reflecting each decision, sufficient to comply with s22. If that were wrong, I would be quite satisfied that, in each case, an order should be inferred from what the judge said. This is consistent with Radju. 
      
       
     110 The final matter raised in relation to this question about the jury arises from a passage in the dissenting judgment of Kirby J in Wu. That case bore some similarities to the present, in that a juror was discharged (mid-trial) because of personal commitments. Kirby J wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         There is another difficulty with the passage of transcript which occurs in the presence of the jury and which therefore alone represents the record of the formal discharge of the juror. The passage proceeds on an apparent assumption that the juror has already been discharged.  
         But that could not lawfully have been done in the absence of the jury 
         . Accordingly, it is necessary to infer from the words ‘[W]e can carry on with eleven’ a judicial decision and order to discharge the juror in question. Whilst I am prepared to imply into the words used such an order, the passage is certainly elliptical. What is undoubtedly missing is an order, as s22 contemplates, that the residual jurors should be considered as remaining ‘for all the purposes of that trial … properly constituted’. (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     111 Heavy reliance was based upon the assertion by his Honour that the discharge of a single juror could not lawfully have been done in the absence of the jury. However, this was a dissenting judgment, and the considerations which moved Kirby J to make this observation obviously did not weigh heavily with the other members of the court. The reason for this, so it was put, was that in that case leave to amend the grounds of appeal in the High Court to encompass a complaint about the making of an order that the trial continue with a reduced number was refused. That may be so. But it is clear that severe practical difficulties would attend a rigid adoption of the principle stated by Kirby J. Where, for example, a juror is taken seriously ill, or is injured, it would hardly be practical to require the discharge of that juror in the presence of the remainder of the jury. It seems to me that Kirby J was doing no more than suggesting that a formal order should, in the ordinary course, be made in the presence of the surviving members of the jury. In my opinion sufficient in that regard was done by the trial judge in this case.  
      
       
     112 Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is no substance in those grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of Reardon which contend that error infected the trial process in relation to the discharge of a single juror, and the continuation of the trial with a jury constituted by the remaining eleven members. I would dismiss these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     113 The second matter concerning the jury arises out of the events that occurred on 29 March. A number of tape recordings had been tendered and played to the jury. Each member of the jury had a copy of an agreed transcript of the tape recordings. The jury had been directed, in the usual terms, that the transcripts were provided as an aide memoire and that, should they detect any discrepancies between the transcript and the tape recording, they should give weight to the tape recording rather than the transcript. 
      
       
     114 Prior to the trial, the Crown and defence counsel had agreed on the deletion of certain material from some of the tapes, and the transcripts were amended accordingly. However, on 29 March, by inadvertence, an unedited version of a tape recording which had been edited by agreement was played in the presence of the jury. The material which should have been edited out did not appear in the transcript on which the jury was attempting to follow the tape recordings. 
      
       
     115 The material that had been deleted from the tape recording included references to “a court date” on which Reardon was required to attend in relation to certain charges. These were referred to as “for belting a screw and copper four years ago”.  
      
       
     116 Trial counsel for Reardon immediately sought a discharge of the jury on the basis that Reardon’s bad character had been exposed by reasons of the error. 
      
       
     117 The trial judge refused, giving reasons. Her Honour made the observation that the tape recording was indistinct, but noted that counsel had been able to discern the words. She said that she herself had not been able to do so. Nevertheless, she accepted that the words were audible to those at the Bar table. 
      
       
     118 She also noted that, in the tapes that were admitted into evidence by consent, there had been references to various criminal behaviours in which Reardon was engaged. This included provision of false drivers’ licences, securing passports to enable the emigration of two men wanted in Australia, the growing of marijuana and other drug matters. Accordingly, her Honour was of the view that the tapes already admitted made it clear that Reardon was engaged in criminal activity. However, the complaint about the material now under consideration is that it disclosed criminal activity of a different kind and different dimension, and included, for the first time, the suggestion of violence. 
      
       
     119 Having considered all relevant matters, her Honour decided that the material was not such as to affect the fairness of the trial and refused the application. However, she stated her intention: 
      
       
        
         
         to direct the jury in very strong terms about such evidence and matters which they ought to exclude from their considerations. 
          
         
        
       She went on to say that she would not do so immediately as to do so might underline the offending evidence rather than minimise its effect. 
        
       
     120 Her Honour began summing up on Monday 10 May 1999. The jury was formally charged early the following morning and retired to consider its verdicts. Her Honour did not give the direction she had foreshadowed. No application was made for such a direction.  
      
       
     121 One submission made on behalf of Reardon was that the reasons given disclosed that the judge had made certain assumptions, and taken into account certain irrelevant considerations. This appears to be a reference to the judge’s allusion to criminality disclosed on tape recordings properly before the jury. This court was not, however, directed to those passages on the tape recordings to which her Honour alluded. It was not argued that her Honour was wrong in the conclusion that the legitimately admitted tape recordings did in fact reveal some criminality, or contact with criminality, on the part of Reardon. 
      
       
     122 Further, it was claimed that the reference to an alleged assault on the part of Reardon was of considerable significance because one disputed matter of fact in the trial concerned an allegation by the Crown that Reardon had threatened another conspirator (also a witness), Ms Villegas, and that he intended the threats to be taken seriously. The passage on the tape recording which, it is clear, should not have been before the jury was, on that argument, capable of being used by the jury in its assessment of the credibility of that evidence. 
      
       
     123 Further, it was argued, despite the absence of any express request on the part of counsel at the conclusion of or during the summing up, the failure to give the direction foreshadowed constituted an error. 
      
       
     124 The last matter can, in my opinion, be put to one side. The summing up took place more than a month after the playing of the tape recording. Obviously its significance was not then apparent to Reardon’s counsel, who did not request any additional direction. 
      
       
     125 The incident was, in reality, a very minor one. Whether or not the tape recording was decipherable by the jury without the aid of a transcript, it seems to me that it could not have played any real part in the jury’s deliberations. The jury had listened to numerous tape recordings by the time the trial concluded. They had the opportunity, if they wished, to replay any of the tape recordings which were exhibits, and they had access to the transcript to remind them in convenient form of what had been said in the conversations. The rogue tape was not with them in the jury room. It had been replaced by the agreed edited version. That version conformed with the transcript. It is, in my opinion, far fetched to think that any member of the jury may have seized upon an accidental reference to a charge involving some kind of assault on police or prison officers, and allowed that to influence the verdict. Had it appeared to counsel for Reardon that that was possible, he would have been expected to remind the judge of the direction she had intended giving. 
      
       
     126 I am satisfied that the refusal to discharge the jury, and the failure to give the foreshadowed direction, did not result in any miscarriage of justice. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       2.  
       Evidence Act 
       , s165 (grounds 4 and 5) 
       
     127 Mention has already been made of the witness W. He was a registered informant of the NSW Crimes Commission, and became an informant for the NCA, obviously working closely with officers of the NCA in his encounters with the appellants. He was instrumental in having recorded the conversations between himself and Reardon in particular. Because the evidence he gave was almost entirely corroborated by the incontrovertible evidence of the tape recordings, his evidence was largely not in dispute. However, there was one issue of fact on which his evidence was in direct collision with that given by Reardon. This concerns the date of the first meeting between W and Reardon, and the identity of the person who had first initiated the subject of drugs. W claimed that the first meeting took place on 11 June, which was tape recorded. There was no doubt that there was a meeting on 11 June, and was recorded; and the contents of the tape recording were not in dispute. Reardon, however, claimed that there had been an earlier meeting, not the subject of tape recording, and that at this meeting W, not Reardon, raised the subject of importing cocaine. Of course, there being no tape recording of such a meeting, Reardon’s evidence did not have the corroboration that W’s evidence, generally, had. W denied that there had been an earlier meeting. This issue was capable of being quite significant in the jury’s assessment of the case put by Reardon, that is, that he was merely playing along with W without any intention ever of genuinely participating in the importation. 
      
       
     128 At the conclusion of the evidence discussion between the trial judge and counsel took place concerning directions to be given to the jury. Counsel for Reardon said: 
      
       
        
         
         the direction of police informants. 
         
        
        
       Nothing more was said. If this was intended to be a request, under s165 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        for a direction that the jury should exercise caution in determining whether to accept this evidence because he was a police informant, it was as senior counsel on the appeal conceded, elliptical. 
        
       
     129 When asked by the judge for authority the Crown Prosecutor referred to R v Dellapatrona and Duffield (1993) 31 NSWLR 123. It will be necessary to refer to this decision shortly. 
      
       
     130 For the moment it is only necessary to observe that the Crown Prosecutor’s response made it plain that he understood the statement made by counsel for Reardon as a reference to directions concerning police informants and a perceived need for caution in the approach to their evidence. The discussion then moved to a question of a direction in relation to the evidence of police officers, this being raised by counsel for Michaels. 
      
       
     131 What is now put is that the evidence of W should have been the subject of a warning pursuant to s165 of the Evidence Act, and that, no such warning having been given, a miscarriage of justice occurred. 
      
       
     132 Section 165 appears in Part 4.5 of the Evidence Act which is under the general heading of “Warnings”. The section itself has a heading “Unreliable Evidence”. The section is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         165(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
          
           
           (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
            
           (b) identification evidence,  
            
           (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,  
            
           (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,  
            
           (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,  
            
           (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,  
            
           (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person – evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.  
           
          
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
          
           
           (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
            
           (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
            
           (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
           
          
         (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.  
          
         (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
          
         (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
         
        
       
     133 A number of things are to be noted about the section. Firstly, although in sub-s(1) illustrations are given of the kind of evidence recognised as potentially unreliable, the section is not confined to evidence so identified, or to evidence given by witnesses of the categories identified. The opening words of sub-s(1) make it plain that the section applies to evidence “of a kind that may be unreliable”, which includes that evidence specifically mentioned, but may travel beyond evidence in those categories. Secondly, by sub-s(2), the obligation on the judge in a jury case to give a direction depends upon the request of a party. Even when such a request is made, by sub-s(3) the request need not be complied with if there are good reasons for not giving the direction sought. Finally, by sub-s(5), the section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to or to inform the jury. 
      
       
     134 Senior counsel who appeared for Reardon on the appeal conceded that the request for a direction was “elliptical”, but contended that it was adequate to come within s165(2). He relied upon the obvious recognition by the Crown Prosecutor, in his reference to Dellapatrona, that what was said by trial counsel amounted to a request for a direction under s165(2) with specific reference to police informants.  
      
       
     135 I accept that, even though police informants are not among the categories expressly mentioned in s165(1), their evidence is, at least potentially, within the opening words of that sub section, that is, of a kind that may be unreliable. Further, the evidence of W needed to be scrutinised with some care, because he had gained substantial benefit from the assistance he had given to the NCA. This is, in my view, classically a circumstance which not only calls for caution in the approach to be taken to the evidence of such a witness, but which may in appropriate circumstances need to be expressly drawn to the jury’s attention. 
      
       
     136 All of the foregoing, is, of course, principally concerned with evidence of a kind which may be unreliable, where that evidence is in issue. It would be a mistake to direct a jury to treat with caution evidence given by a witness of a class within s165(1), where that evidence is undisputed. It would confuse the jury and unnecessarily prolong the summing up. The absence of any real dispute about a witness’s evidence could be a good reason, within sub-s(3,) for declining to give a direction, even where one is sought. It is for these reasons that I have earlier noted that W’s evidence was, in the main, uncontroversial. It was only in relation to Reardon’s claim that he had met W on an occasion earlier than 11 June (on which occasion he said the conversation was unrecorded) and that, at that meeting, W had initiated the discussion about the importation or supply of drugs, that any assessment had to be made of the credibility of W’s evidence. 
      
       
     137 The question now raised on the appeal requires consideration of the significance of this aspect of W’s evidence. In this regard it is to be recalled that Reardon’s defence was that he did purport to participate in the conspiracy, but that his mind was not engaged in it and that he was, in fact, masquerading as a conspirator in order to defraud W, or those who were to finance the proposed operation. If it were the fact that W had initiated the suggestion about participation, that would sit more easily with Reardon’s position than would a conclusion that he himself had first raised the subject. 
      
       
     138 The transcript of the conversation of 11 June presents a different picture to that proposed by Reardon. Firstly, it records Dillon apparently introducing Reardon to W. Such an introduction would be inconsistent with an earlier recent meeting between the two men. Secondly, it records W telling Dillon to absent himself so that he (W) could have a conversation with Reardon. Thirdly, it records Reardon saying the following: 
      
       
        
         
         Alright mate what the story is right I gotta big bloke in Canberra and very high up right he’s got the lead in over there Chile way right … 
         It’s a well established business it’s been going for eight years … right he’s had one little mishap that’s all he had one in eight years. Had the dogs run through his shit (INAUDIBLE) he said call back and everything it was (INAUDIBLE) it’s going to takes (sic) six to eight weeks to get over here …right. (INAUDIBLE) down here he’ll do fifty at a time … 
         
        
        
       The tenor of the remaining conversation is consistent with Reardon putting a proposal to W rather than the reverse. On its face this conversation is quite inconsistent with Reardon’s account given in evidence.  
        
       
     139 In cross examination Reardon was asked about this recording. He was unable to explain why there were, apparently, introductions on 11 June when, on his account, he and W were already acquainted with one another. He maintained that this was the second meeting, at which he was role-playing for his own purposes. 
      
       
     140 It is obvious from the transcript of the discussion between counsel and the judge that the “request” for a direction under s165 was not pursued with any vigour, and, indeed, became lost in the subsequent discussion about other matters. This may have been because counsel for Reardon accepted the force of the response made by the Crown Prosecutor in his reference to Dellapatrona.  
      
       
     141 Dellapatrona was decided before the introduction of the Evidence Act and stands quite independently of s165. However, bearing that in mind, the decision is of considerable assistance in resolving the present issue. In that case two witnesses, in a similar position to that of W, gave evidence against an accused in a trial of a drug conspiracy charge. The witnesses had originally been recruited as couriers but became police informers, recording conversations between themselves and the accused. On appeal it was argued that a “special instruction” should have been given to the jury concerning their evidence. This court (constituted by Hunt CJ at CL, Abadee and James JJ) wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         Nor does a mere police informant fall into the category of witnesses about whom a  
         special 
          direction is required. It is a very different thing in relation to prisoner informants: Pollitt v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 558; see also R v Clough [(1992) 18 NSWLR 396] 28 NSWLR 396]. 
           
         But, as those cases make clear, the obligation of the trial judge to warn the jury as to the unreliability of the evidence of such witnesses arises because that unreliability may not be appreciated by the jury, arising as it does out of a prison culture unlikely to be known to them. None of those special circumstances applies to the ordinary police informant. If the informant has a criminal background, that will no doubt be exposed in cross-examination. Such a background was exposed in relation to the [witnesses/informants] in this case, as were the rewards which they had received and the further rewards which they had sought in relation to the assistance which they had given. The judge referred to all of this in his summing up. The possibility that the [witnesses/informants] may have fabricated their evidence for that purpose was made abundantly clear. It did not require any  
         special 
          direction: R v Asciak (1989) 43 A Crim R 256 at 260. We do not interpret this Court’s decision in R v Oliver [(1984) 57 ALR 543] (at 547 – 548) as saying that anything more was required. (emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     142 This passage is useful because it helps to explain why, if it be the case that s165(2) did, prima facie, require a cautionary direction to be given (on request), that nevertheless its absence does not necessarily result in the success of this ground of appeal. Firstly, s165(3) excuses compliance if there are good reasons not to give the caution. Ordinarily, a judge who decided against giving a requested direction would, however briefly, give reasons for so declining. But failure to give reasons also does not necessarily dictate the success of the ground of appeal. 
      
       
     143 The passage extracted from Dellapatrona illustrates what may have been seen as good reasons (or what were in fact good reasons) for not giving the requested direction. These were that potential unreliability, and the reasons for it, must have been obvious, and that the circumstances were fully exposed both in examination in chief and cross-examination. Indeed, the transcript of the closing address of counsel who appeared for Reardon shows that all of these matters were fully drawn to the attention of the jury. This was not one of those matters that called for the express imprimatur of the trial judge, as do some necessary directions of law; once the weaknesses, or potential weaknesses, in the evidence were delineated, the jury was sufficiently well informed and needed no further reminder. Another good reason for declining the direction might be the lack of enthusiasm with which it was pressed, and the absence of any request or reminder at the conclusion of the summing up when the direction had not been given.  
      
       
     144 Further, the passage from Dellapatrona illustrates why it is that, even if in the particular circumstances of the case it would have been better if a direction had been given, its absence did not result in a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     145 My conclusions are that, in the absence of an explanation for declining to give the s165(2) warning, and it having been requested, however elliptically, it probably should have been given. However, I also conclude that the failure to give the direction resulted in no miscarriage of justice. It is helpful to consider precisely what the judge would have been obliged to do had she acceded to the request. She would not have simply given a direction that the jury should exercise caution in relation to W’s evidence. She would have had to relate that direction to the contested evidence. To be fair to both sides, she would have had to draw attention to the evidence supporting the competing positions – the evidence of Reardon that there had been an earlier meeting, and his inability to explain those passages on the tape of 11 June in which introductions were effected. This would only have highlighted the implausibility of Reardon’s defence, and particularly the implausibility of his claim that there had been an earlier meeting. The difficulty for Reardon is that the tape recorded conversation of 11 June is simply incompatible with his defence. In a subsidiary argument it was asserted that the failure to give reasons for non-compliance with the s165(2) request also amounted to error such as to result in a miscarriage of justice. For reasons already given, although it is obviously preferable that reasons be given for declining such a request, I am of the view that failure on this occasion to do so did not result in any miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     146 The terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 make it plain that it is not every error in the trial process that will result in an appeal being allowed. It is necessary that the appeal court also conclude that “the verdict of the jury should be set aside”, or “that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law”, or “that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. 
      
       
     147 The absence of the requested direction does not lead me to the view that the verdict of guilty should be set aside. 
      
       
     148 I would reject these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     149 That concludes the grounds raised on behalf of Reardon. I would dismiss his appeal against conviction.  
      
       
     150 There is some degree of commonality in the grounds of appeal pleaded on behalf of the other two appellants. To the extent of that commonality, they may be dealt with together.  
      
       
        
       TAYLOR’S AND MICHAELS’ CONVICTION APPEALS 
        
       1. “Prasad” direction (ground 2) 
       
     151 Initially both appellants pleaded that error occurred by the failure of the trial judge to give a direction, at the conclusion of the Crown case, in terms contemplated in R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161; 2 A Crim R 45. That ground was pressed on behalf of Taylor but not on behalf of Michaels. 
      
       
     152 In Prasad King CJ wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         It is, of course, open to the jury at any time after the close of the case for the prosecution to inform the judge that the evidence which they have heard is insufficient to justify a conviction and to bring in a verdict of not guilty without hearing more. It is within the discretion of the judge to inform the jury of this right, and if he decides to do so he usually tells them at the close of the case for the prosecution that they may exercise the right then or at any later stage of the proceedings, … he may undoubtedly, if he sees fit, advise them to stop the case and bring in a verdict of not guilty. 
         
        
       
     153 In my experience, it has long been recognised in NSW that a judge may, in a suitable case, and in the exercise of his or her discretion, take the course outlined by King CJ. There is no rule that in any particular set of circumstances a judge is obliged to take that course or ought to take that course. The decision to do so or not to do so lies entirely within the discretion of the judge. I can think of no circumstances in which a refusal to give such a direction could result in a miscarriage of justice. True it is, that at the end of the Crown case an accused has to make certain elections, for example about giving evidence or not giving evidence, and about calling witnesses or not calling witnesses. The fact that an accused person is obliged to make certain tactical decisions, some of which may, conceivably, operate in practice to his or her disadvantage, does not mean that there is an entitlement to a direction in accordance with Prasad. 
      
       
     154 At the conclusion of the Crown case counsel for Taylor sought a Prasad direction. The trial judge considered the application overnight, and rejected it, giving short reasons. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         … I understand that in order for me to exercise my discretion in that regard, I would have to be satisfied that the evidence against Mr Taylor is such that a jury ought to be instructed that it could, if it wishes, return a verdict of not guilty in respect of him without hearing further evidence. 
          
          
         I have had the opportunity of reviewing the evidence against Mr Taylor. I am satisfied that this is not a proper case in which to give a Prasad direction and I decline to so. 
         
        
       
     155 Appeal counsel for Taylor submitted that: 
      
       
        
         
         Where it is appropriate to do so, that is it is a reasonable request by counsel for the accused having regard to the evidence, 
          it is incumbent 
          to inform the jury of its right.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     156 He further submitted that failure so to inform the jury in appropriate circumstances could amount to a miscarriage of justice. Finally, he submitted that: 
      
       
        
         
         The consequence of the failure to give the direction was that the accused was disentitled to the exercise by the jury of its right to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a conviction – a right which is an incident of a fair trial. 
         
        
       
     157 I would reject each of these submissions. Firstly, as I have noted above, the power to give a direction is entirely discretionary. It depends, inter alia, upon the assessment of the trial judge of the weight of the evidence against the particular accused. As was pointed out in Prasad, a direction by the judge to the jury as to the weight it should attribute to admissible evidence intrudes upon the jury function. The Prasad direction, in the terms stated in Prasad and as ordinarily given, carefully avoids trespassing upon that function. Nevertheless, to give such a direction can carry with it a suggestion to the jury that admissible evidence should be given little or no weight. A judge giving a Prasad direction has to tread a very fine line to avoid trespassing upon the jury function. A decision on an application for such a direction requires an assessment of the evidence in the Crown case but avoidance of conveying the results of that assessment.  
      
       
     158 In my opinion the trial judge exercised her discretion on proper principles when asked for a direction and no error has been identified. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       2. Cross-examination of Taylor by the Crown (ground 4) 
       
     159 In order to explain this ground of appeal it is necessary to set out a little more of the evidence given by Taylor in his defence case.  
      
       
     160 In evidence in chief he said that he had been introduced to Reardon by Allan Johnstone. He also knew Douglas and Cynthia Crombie. He said, however, that he did not hear any conversation concerning the importation of cocaine. On one meeting at a hotel, he said, he introduced Reardon and Crombie, bought them a drink and, while they sat down and talked, he had a meal at a different table. 
      
       
     161 When asked (in chief) specifically about Allan Johnstone he said this: 
      
       
        
         
         When I first met him, Allan Johnstone, it was socially and I thought he was a nice man. When he started to say certain things to me, and also I knew he was dealing in certain things I started to disassociate myself with him. 
         
        
       
     162 He gave evidence of a meeting with Crombie. Of this, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         Douglas told me that he thought he was going to Chile to secure some cocaine and I advised him not to do it. And he said ‘I’m not, I won’t do it. I will go for a holiday anyway’. 
         
        
       
     163 He acknowledged that Crombie had been (to Taylor’s knowledge) a cocaine user, but added: 
      
       
        
         
         Not as bad as his wife. 
         
        
       
     164 The Crown then sought a ruling from the trial judge on cross-examination which, it contended, was permissible, having regard to the inferences available to be drawn from these answers. Seeking such a ruling was a precautionary measure, as the Crown argued that the evidence it sought so to adduce was not inadmissible. The Crown submitted that the implication from Taylor’s answers was that he disapproved of drug use in general, or cocaine use in particular. Accordingly, Taylor having raised as an issue his attitude to drug use, the Crown was (it argued) entitled to cross-examine him in two separate ways: firstly, in respect to previous convictions for drug related offences, secondly, in relation to a previous association with cocaine. The trial judge ruled against the Crown in relation to evidence of prior drug related convictions, but in favour of the Crown in relation to cross-examination about other drug-related activity. That cross-examination elicited from Taylor an admission that, at the time he met Crombie, he was using cocaine. He denied the suggestion directly put to him in cross-examination that he had taught Crombie how to “use or free base” cocaine. He said, however, that he ceased his association with cocaine in 1989. He denied having attempted to convey to the jury the impression that he disapproved of Crombie’s use of cocaine but said that he had sought to convey that impression with respect to Cynthia Crombie’s use of the drug whilst she was pregnant. Other than that, Taylor denied the suggestions put to him.  
      
       
     165 The only evidence which emerged from the cross-examination permitted by her Honour which could support the ground of appeal is the answer acknowledging that Taylor had used cocaine. This was somewhat qualified by his evidence that he had abandoned its use in 1989. 
      
       
     166 Counsel for Taylor on appeal has not submitted that the cross-examination was inadmissible, but rather that its prejudicial effect was such that the discretions (or evaluations) provided for in ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act should have operated against its admission.  
      
       
     167 By s135 the court is empowered to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger, inter alia, that it might be unfairly prejudicial to a party; by s137, in a criminal proceeding, the court is obliged to exclude evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
      
       
     168 As noted above, the only material prejudicial to Taylor that emerged from the cross-examination was his acknowledgment of his prior use of cocaine. Given that he had indeed presented himself, in his evidence in chief, as a person who shrank from the use of cocaine, or from dealing in cocaine (or other “certain things”), it would have been unfair to the Crown not to allow a challenge to that assertion. When this is taken into account, I am satisfied that any prejudice caused by the evidence of earlier cocaine use did not “substantially outweigh” its probative value (s135); and that any such prejudice was not “unfair” (s137). 
      
       
     169 Pursuant to his ground numbered 4, Michaels complained that this cross-examination of Taylor impacted prejudicially on him. It will be remembered that Michaels’ defence was that the conversations in which he was involved were not about cocaine but about a paper or cardboard recycling business. The submission that was made was that: 
      
       
        
         
         … the effect was to make the appellant Michaels’ version … less likely given the fact that, according to the Crown case, Taylor was part of a conspiracy to import cocaine and had previous dealing in the narcotic. 
         
        
       
     170 As I understand this argument, its effect is that evidence that strengthened the case against Taylor should not have been admitted, or should not have been admitted against Michaels, because of its effect on the case against him. There is no substance in the submission. This was a charge of conspiracy, in which the Crown was entitled to adduce against each alleged conspirator the evidence implicating him. To the extent that any evidence was admissible against one or more, but not another or others of the conspirators, it was always open to counsel to seek a specific limitation of the evidence (s136 of the Evidence Act), or a direction that the evidence was not tendered against or admissible against another conspirator. No such limitation or direction was sought. 
      
       
     171 In any event, the evidence concerning Taylor and his previous dealings in cocaine have been dealt with above. It could have had little adverse impact on the case against him, let alone in the case against Michaels. 
      
       
     172 I am satisfied that there was no error in allowing this cross-examination of Taylor by the Crown Prosecutor. 
      
       
        
        
        
       3. Evidence of a conversation between Reardon and Crombie (ground 5) 
       
     173 Cynthia Crombie’s sister, Haydee Martinez-Diaz, gave evidence in the Crown case. She gave evidence of travelling with Douglas Crombie to Chile and then Bolivia. Her function was to translate for Crombie and those he was dealing with in those countries. In Chile they shared an apartment with Reardon. She recounted a conversation with Reardon concerning the rewards the various participants were to receive for their involvement. She claimed that Reardon had said that Taylor would receive 19 kg of cocaine as “part of the payment”. 
      
       
     174 It is this conversation that is the subject of the fifth ground of appeal by both Taylor and Michaels. In pressing the ground, counsel acknowledged that no counsel at trial had objected to the evidence. 
      
       
     175 Once again ss.135 and 137 of the Evidence Act were invoked as the reasons the evidence should have been rejected. 
      
       
     176 Since no objection was taken at trial, her Honour neither considered s135 or s137, nor gave reasons for admitting the evidence. However I am of the view that the evidence was not “unfairly prejudicial”, nor did it carry a danger of unfair prejudice. Evidence of what Taylor was to receive was plainly evidence of a circumstance relevant to establish, or to advance, the Crown case.  
      
       
     177 A further complaint about this evidence concerned the directions given by the trial judge. What she said was: 
      
       
        
         
         In this case there are occasions on which one of the accused is discussing another accused who is not present. There is at least one example of this type of evidence in this case and that was given in the case of Haydee Martinez-Diaz when she was in Santiago and she said that she overheard Mr Reardon and Mr Crombie discussing the proposition that Mr Taylor was to receive 10 kilos of cocaine as his share of the importation. 
          
          
         If you are satisfied that the overheard conversation between Mr Reardon and Mr Crombie was in furtherance of the conspiracy, or in other words, that it was advancing the conspiracy towards achieving its ends, then you can use that piece of evidence of a conversation in determining whether Mr Taylor was a participant in the conspiracy, even though he was not part of the conversation at the time. 
          
          
         However, you must bear in mind that this is a conversation, and there are others about which I will tell you, when in this instance Mr Taylor had no part. He was not there. You should be careful when considering this type of conversation and not be too quick to find that an accused person participated in the conspiracy based on the word of another accused, and in the absence of the person being spoken about. As I say, I will return to this issue later. 
         
        
       
     178 True to her word, her Honour did return to the evidence of the conversation. She reminded the jury again of the evidence of Ms Martinez-Diaz and said: 
      
       
        
         
         You will remember that I said that if you are satisfied that this conversation was in furtherance of the conspiracy, that is moved the agreement towards its intended goal, then you may use it in your consideration as to whether Mr Taylor was a participant in the conspiracy. However, you must remember that Mr Taylor was not a party to that conversation and you must be careful when considering this evidence before using it as evidence on the question of his participation. 
         
        
        
       She then went on to refer to Taylor’s evidence. 
        
       
     179 One of the complaints made about the directions is that they did not adequately identify the difficulties faced by Taylor when called upon to answer a case which included a conversation to which he was not a party. In my opinion the extracts above require the rejection of this proposition. On more than one occasion her Honour drew to the jury’s attention the fact that it was not alleged that Taylor had been present during the conversation, and made it clear that he was therefore not in a position to make any direct answer. A further complaint is that the direction did not adequately identify the way in which the evidence (if accepted) could be used to support the Crown case. This complaint, also, must be rejected. It is plain that what her Honour was telling the jury was that, if they accepted that the conversation was part of, or one of the steps in, the conspiracy, then it could be used against all alleged conspirators. In any event, had any inadequacy in the direction been perceived by counsel who appeared at the trial, that inadequacy could readily have been corrected. The fact that no re-direction was sought does not only create a difficulty for Taylor in now advancing the argument; it is also evidence that what is now perceived to be a deficiency was not, in the context and atmosphere of the trial, perceived as such a deficiency. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       4. Unreasonable verdict (ground 1) 
       
     180 The final ground to be dealt with is that numbered 1 in each of the grounds of appeal filed, the assertion that the verdict is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. In large part the argument directed to this ground on behalf of Taylor raised again the evidentiary matters disposed of under grounds 4 and 5. It is unnecessary, having regard to my expressed view about those grounds, to say more about that. The remaining matter asserted was that the finding of guilty was unreasonable having regard to : 
      
       
        
         
         the nature of the case against Taylor 
           
         and it’s dependence on its acceptance of the witness Crombie. 
         
        
       
     181 No complaint being made about the directions given in relation to Crombie, I would reject the proposition that the Crown’s dependence upon his evidence rendered the conviction unreasonable. It is not the case that a conviction based upon the evidence of an accomplice is unsustainable; what is necessary is that relevant matters requiring caution be drawn to the attention of the jury. This was duly done. 
      
       
     182 There was no further explanation of the reference to “the nature of the case”. In my opinion the evidence taken as a whole was sufficient to justify the verdict. I would dismiss this ground of appeal as raised by Taylor. 
      
       
     183 In support of this ground as raised by Michaels it was submitted that the evidence actually implicating him was so limited as to be insufficient to establish a case. It is therefore necessary to review the evidence that does implicate him. Federal Agent Purchas gave evidence that, during a telephone conversation with Reardon on 16 November, Reardon mentioned the name “Edgar” and gave Purchas a telephone number. He said that he telephoned that number and spoke to Michaels on the same day. The conversation was recorded and a transcript was in evidence. There are significant passages contained in the transcript consistent with the involvement of Michaels in the enterprise. The following day Purchas met Michaels in Rushcutters Bay Park. Purchas was fitted with a listening device and, again, their conversation was recorded. Again, parts of the conversation, including remarks by Michaels, are consistent with his involvement as alleged by the Crown. Later on the same day there was a short telephone conversation between the two men, which also was recorded and which is again consistent with the allegations made in the Crown case. A further meeting took place later on the same day between the two men. Although Purchas was again fitted with a listening device, the location of the meeting was such as to render the transmission largely incomprehensible and no transcript was able to be provided. There were further telephone conversations, and a meeting on 18 November. 
      
       
     184 There was a significant dispute about the content of the conversation which was not able to be recorded. However, this does not affect the adequacy of the evidence adduced by the Crown to sustain the charge. Whether or not the jury accepted the account of the conversation given by Purchas, the uncontested tape recordings provided sufficient evidence on which the jury could convict. Michaels was unable, in his evidence, to give any adequate explanation of the incriminating passages. 
      
       
     185 I am satisfied that the verdict of guilty was open to the jury. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       5.  
       Evidence Act, 
        sections 38 and 192 (ground 3) 
       
     186 In relation to this ground, I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
       SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 
       
     187 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal (on 25 October 2001) counsel for Michaels sought an adjournment. He advanced two bases for the application. One was that the hearing had been fixed on a date on which senior counsel, who had long held a brief in the appeal for Michaels, was unavailable, and that he himself had only recently been instructed. 
      
       
     188 The other basis for the adjournment application was that the NCA had failed to produce certain documents which it had, on 3 August 2001, been ordered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) to produce to Michaels. These documents, it was anticipated, would or might contain material that would or might cast doubt on the credibility of the NCA officer, Purchas. For these to be available for use by Michaels in support of his appeal, it would be necessary that they come within the rules concerning fresh evidence: see, for example Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259. 
      
       
     189 This Court was not satisfied that the documents either did or did not fall within that category and felt constrained to allow Michaels to obtain them in order to have the opportunity to present a ground of appeal based upon them. It declined to grant the adjournment of the whole appeal, but granted leave to Michaels to seek, pursuant to s12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the production to the Court of certain documents, and to Michaels and the Crown to furnish further written submissions within a specified timetable. The Court reserved the question of whether it would reach a decision based upon the written submissions, or provide for a further oral hearing. 
      
       
     190 On that basis the Court proceeded with the hearing of the appeal on which, subject to the additional matters to be raised by Michaels, it reserved its decision.  
      
       
     191 On or about 12 December 2001, the Court received a nineteen page written submission signed by Michaels himself. It began with a request for leave to adduce fresh evidence “that contradicts the evidence given by the Crown witnesses at the trial”. Michaels named a Ms Rita Grana as the person whom he wished to call as a witness. What follows in the document is not easy to understand. The submission consists of a series of assertions of fact, argument both legal and factual, and references to the trial transcript. 
      
       
     192 So far as I can make it out, what emerges from the document is that Michaels wishes to make a number of assertions or arguments concerning matters raised in the trial. One of these is evidence about the alleged transfer of $375,000, which Michaels claims was made by the NCA. Another matter raised was the involvement of NCA officers in the proposed importation, suggesting that they had instigated the arrangements, and had behaved improperly in doing so. He raised the prospect of calling another witness, (“Mr William J Riley”), who, he said, would be able to give “more detailed records of [W]’s criminal activities and liaison with police officers”. He claimed that W had a criminal record additional to that disclosed in the trial, and also had a history of psychiatric illness, such as to bear upon his credibility and/or reliability. This, he asserted, was known to the prosecution, but not disclosed to the accused in the trial. He claimed that, after the trial, and pursuant to the FOI Act, a large number of documents constituting the police running sheets in the investigation were released, and that these incriminated the Australian and Chilean police. He claimed that the documents showed that police had “viciously threatened” Reardon in Chile and in Australia. He claimed also that the running sheets showed that another NCA witness, Fehon, had given false evidence. He questioned the evidence that the tape recorder operated by Purchas on 18 November had malfunctioned, with the result that the conversation between himself and Michaels was not recorded. In an earlier letter (dated 9 November 2001) requesting an extension of time for filing his submissions, Michaels had requested access to the tape recording of that date, for the purpose of scientific testing to ascertain whether it had, as was the evidence of Purchas, malfunctioned. 
      
       
     193 The Crown filed a short written submission in reply. It directly addressed only Michaels’ allegation that the fresh evidence he sought to adduce disclosed that the NCA had paid a sum of $375,000, and that this, in turn, showed that Purchas’ evidence (in which he denied that that had occurred) was false. 
      
       
     194 The Court reconvened on 1 March 2002, indicating that it would be assisted by argument in relation to four matters raised by Michaels. These were: - (i) the evidence that the NCA had paid $375,000, and any conclusions to be drawn if that fact was established;(ii) the allegation that the continued operation of the alleged conspiracy was brought about by pressure brought to bear by, inter alia, Purchas, and that material supporting that was withheld at the trial;(iii) the assertion that W’s true criminal history and psychiatric history were relevant and known to the Crown, not disclosed;(iv) the testing of the tape recorder which had allegedly malfunctioned on 18 November. 
      
       
     195 In response, the Crown filed a considerable body of affidavit evidence including many pages of annexures. I will refer to this evidence in considering the matters subsequently put on behalf of Michaels. 
      
       
     196 The Court appointed 5 April 2002 for the further hearing. All appellants were represented. Counsel who appeared for Michaels, Mr Corish, called on orders to produce that had been issued out of the Court pursuant to s12(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and served upon the NCA and Citibank. A solicitor acting for Citibank appeared to produce two documents in response to the notice and was excused. This production prompted an application by senior counsel for the NCA, Mr Johnson, to apply to be heard in order to make a claim for public interest immunity with respect to the documents produced by Citibank. He made no objection to the documents being inspected by members of the Court, but did object to their being made available to the appellants. They were in fact inspected by each member of the Court. It is inappropriate to disclose their contents. The claim for public interest immunity was upheld. 
      
       
     197 I can now turn to the substance of the four issues earlier mentioned.  
      
       
        
       (i) evidence concerning the payment of $375,000 by the NCA 
       
     198 So far as I understand it, the allegation that the NCA had paid the sum of $375,000 was not put as of itself (if established) having any particular probative force, or any specific consequences for the outcome of the trial or the appeal. It was raised to impugn Purchas’ credibility. Purchas had denied that that sum was in fact paid. 
      
       
     199 Among the documents annexed to the Crown’s affidavits were extracts from the operation running sheets, some of which had, admittedly, not previously been produced. Included in this bundle of documents was an entry for 30 July 1997 noting that a facsimile had been sent to “Comisario Antonio Cubillos”, which included an application for an international payment order to Mr Oscar Miranda in the sum of $US375,000. There was at least one other entry which spoke of an authorisation to transfer that sum. 
      
       
     200 Evidence was led by the Crown from a Citibank employee that the records of Citibank disclosed no transfer of money pursuant to the application, and on that basis I infer that no transfer was made. As indicated during argument, the confidential documents in respect of which public interest immunity was granted were not inconsistent with this conclusion. There is no reason, therefore, (associated with the claimed payment) to doubt Purchas’ credibility. That is, any additional evidence on this subject could not assist Michaels in his appeal. 
      
       
        
       (ii) pressure exerted by the NCA 
       
     201 The next issue raised by Michaels concerned the role of the NCA in, allegedly, putting pressure on the appellants and others with a view to enmeshing them further in the arrangements to import the drugs. 
      
       
     202 There was some material contained in the running sheets that could give the appearance of confirming that the NCA officers and their associates actively involved themselves in the furtherance of the arrangements, and even of putting and maintaining pressure on participants; for example, on 4 August 1997 an entry records: 
      
       
        
         
         Cubillos was advised that from Tuesday we will start pressuring REARDON through CC463. Cubillos advised that UC [undercover operative] will start putting pressure on REARDON as well, after $375 K is transferred into UC’s account. 
         
        
       
     203 Another entry, the next day, reads: 
      
       
        
         
         UC to start pressuring REARDON to proceed with transaction. UC to wear a wire on future meetings to allow police to charge REARDON on conspiracy charges under Chilean drug legislation, under a worst case scenario (no drugs on grounds). 
         
        
       
     204 However, it is appropriate here to note that this entry was preceded by the following: 
      
       
        
         
         Police is disconcerted by REARDON’s confidence in getting about Santiago (as he supposedly had never been there and travels by public transport around Santiago without asking for directions) and the fact that he does not seem to be contacting anyone locally. Police are wary that REARDON may have planned a rip-off and may not proceed with a transaction (this based on REARDON’s movements about the city and his non-contacting any locals). 
         
        
       
     205 On 6 August 1997 the following was recorded: 
      
       
        
         
         REARDON will have to leave hotel on Friday at noon. UC to apply pressure on REARDON, whilst CC463 to apply pressure REARDON from Australia. 
         
        
       
     206 And on 7 August 1997 the following was recorded: 
      
       
        
         
         REARDON very concerned about the loss of face and his criminal reputation in Australia as a professional. REARDON explained that transport people had not consolidated a full load and importation could not be carried through. Oscar pushed him hard to see if REARDON would show gear. Oscar told in repeated occasions that REARDON had no idea on the calibre of people he was dealing with (on financial side) and that his lack of professionalism reflected poorly on the group. Oscar told REARDON that ‘You do not a) treat a large credible organisation like the one I work for in that manner’. 
         
        
       
     207 None of these entries was disclosed to Michaels or his lawyers at the time of the trial. 
      
       
     208 Michaels’ submissions in relation to this material are not easy to follow. They include the following: 
      
       
        
         
         This new record give the opportunity to prove to the Court of Criminal Appeal that the police viciously threatened Mr Reardon in Chile and in Australia. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         There is overwhelming evidence of the illegal acts by the police in Australia and in Chile to created (sic) this alleges (sic) conspiracy by used (sic) of duress methods and other tactic and also the fact they engaged in a conspiracy to cover these illegal acts during the trial, as this new fresh evidence shows. 
          
          
         … The new fresh evidence shows the extension of illegality and the police did desire to put themselves above the law, and willingness of the Police to continue to cover and to enrolled (sic) other crown witnesses to assist them to pursued (sic) in more illegal acts even if is in the expenses of the judicial system. 
         
        
       
     209 Towards the end of the submission Michaels referred to a parliamentary joint committee on the involvement of the NCA in controlled operations, and to what appear to be certain submissions put to that committee, and recommendations made by it. 
      
       
     210 I have already referred to the decision of the High Court in Mickelberg. Inter alia, Toohey and Gaudron JJ wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ‘credible’, ‘cogent’, ‘relevant’, ‘plausible’: … in essence the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been put before it … or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ‘a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]’ … (internal references omitted.) 
         
        
       
     211 There is nothing in the material relied upon that remotely suggests that Michaels’ participation in the venture was brought about in any way as a result of pressure applied to him. The most that could be said is that pressure was exerted on Reardon and that may have influenced Reardon to escalate his level of activity. The evidence falls far short, however, of raising any question as to the voluntariness of Michaels’ conduct, or even Reardon’s. Certainly, in my view, it could not be said that, had this material been available to it, “the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of” Michaels. Nor could it be said that it gives rise to any “significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted” Michaels if the jury had had access to the material. 
      
       
        
       (iii) the criminal and psychiatric history of W 
       
     212 The third matter concerns the police informer, W. Michaels argued that evidence as to his criminal record and his psychiatric history was withheld at the trial. I have already mentioned the cross-examination concerning his criminal record. Counsel who appeared for Michaels expressly declined to present any further argument in relation to this question. I think this reflected a correct assessment of the value of the evidence. Any omissions in the criminal record were of little, if any, moment, given what was before the jury, and, particularly, in the light of the very narrow area of dispute concerning W’s evidence. The latter point applied equally to the non-disclosure of W’s psychiatric history. There was, in any event, only the most slender foundation for any conclusion that W suffered from a relevant psychiatric condition. Such as there was was to be found in a record of a Court appearance in respect of a 1996 charge. The summary of the result shows that he was released on a recognizance pursuant to s558 of the Crimes Act 1914, with a condition that he accept the supervision of the NSW Probation and Parole Service, and accept psychiatric treatment. There was also evidence of an NCA file note containing a Probation and Parole Service report to the same effect, indicating that the date of the order was 9 December 1998, and that the terms of the order were that he continue to accept psychiatric treatment. 
      
       
     213 This note confirmed that the NCA was aware of the condition of the recognizance. 
      
       
     214 In order to investigate this question more fully, Michaels’ legal representatives had issued a notice to produce to the District Court, where the recognizance was imposed, but examination of the file accordingly produced disclosed no psychiatric reports or anything in elucidation of the condition in respect of which W was receiving psychiatric treatment. 
      
       
     215 Relying on the decision of the High Court in Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65, unreported, 15 November 2001, counsel for Michaels argued that the information in the possession of the NCA should have been disclosed prior to trial. 
      
       
     216 The material produced is, in my view, quite inadequate to allow of any conclusion that there existed psychiatric evidence of a kind that might have permitted effective cross-examination such as to affect, or potentially to affect, the outcome of the trial. As I have noted above, the narrowness of the contest concerning W’s evidence and the clear corroboration via the tape recordings of most of what he said, makes it difficult indeed to think that any such evidence could have had any bearing at all. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the one area where his evidence was contested did not relate to Michaels at all, but to Reardon. 
      
       
        
       (iv) the malfunctioning tape recorder 
       
     217 The final matter concerned the tape recording of meetings between Michaels and Purchas, and particularly that meeting, at which, on the Crown case, the tape malfunctioned. The tape was made available to Michaels’ legal representatives for testing, it was tested, and a report provided and tendered in evidence. It is sufficient to say that the report does not lend any support at all to scepticism about the Crown’s evidence and, quite properly, no oral submissions were directed to this question. 
      
       
     218 I am therefore satisfied that none of the additional matters raised by Michaels can affect the result of the appeal. To the extent that they depend upon the so-called “fresh evidence” rules, I am of the view that the evidence, if admitted, is insufficient to affect the result. I would, therefore, not allow it to be adduced. 
      
       
     219 The Court also permitted further submissions to be put on behalf of Reardon, but these added nothing to the arguments that have previously been put and dealt with above. 
      
       
     220 The consequence is, that in my view, all appeals against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
     221 I have read and agree with the reasons of Barr J in relation to the applications for leave to appeal against sentence, and I agree with the orders proposed. 
      
       
     222 BARR J: I agree, for the reasons explained by Hodgson JA and Simpson J, that the appeals against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
     223 The sentencing judge found that although he had no knowledge of and no history of involvement with illegal drugs Reardon made himself a principal of the enterprise and played a significant role. He made himself responsible for arranging finance and supply and, when initial supply arrangements produced nothing, for arranging substitute supplies. He arranged for shipment. No complaint was made about these findings. In view of Reardon’s attitude throughout the trial, namely that he never intended to import cocaine but wanted merely to swindle those who put up the money, it was not submitted to Her Honour or in this Court that he ought to have been found sorry for what he had done. 
      
       
     224 It was submitted on appeal that the sentence and non-parole period fell outside the range of her Honour’s sentencing discretion because her Honour made insufficient allowance for the fact that the involvement of the investigating authorities almost from the beginning of the conspiracy meant that there was never any prospect that any cocaine would be imported, because her Honour rejected the submission that Reardon’s criminal activity was induced by those authorities and because her Honour placed insufficient weight on the hardship the sentence had brought upon Reardon’s family. It was also submitted in general terms that the head sentence and the non-parole period were too long and that Reardon had a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing his sentence with those imposed upon Cox and Michaels.  
      
       
     225 It is convenient to deal with the first two grounds together. The submission was made to her Honour and repeated in this Court that Reardon should have been sentenced on the basis that but for the assistance, encouragement or incitement of the officers of the law enforcement authorities throughout Reardon would not have entered into the conspiracy and would not have carried out any overt acts. As her Honour pointed out, it was clear from the evidence of Dillon that Reardon approached him early in 1997 asking for funds for the importation that was then proposed. That was before W and Purchas became involved. The evidence established that these things happened before W reported the matter to Purchas and became, relevantly, an agent of the authorities - 
      
       
        
         
         Reardon and Cox agreed to import fifty kilograms of cocaine.  
          
          
         They agreed to use Cox’s wine importing business to do so.  
          
          
         Taylor was part of the conspiracy. 
          
          
         Taylor obtained through Johnstone an introduction to Crombie. 
          
          
         Taylor and Crombie spoke in January 1997 about a man they thought would arrange the passage of goods through Port Botany without Customs inspection. 
          
          
         Taylor introduced Crombie to Reardon. 
          
          
         Reardon told Crombie that the enterprise needed money and a supplier of cocaine. 
          
          
         Crombie agreed to try to find a supplier in Chile. 
          
          
         Crombie recruited Villegas to find the required amount at the required price. 
          
          
         Villegas agreed to try to do so. 
          
          
         Reardon asked Dillon for help to finance the venture. 
          
          
         Dillon could not help but asked W. 
         
        
       
     226 In view of that evidence her Honour was correct in rejecting the submission. However, it was also submitted in this Court that the authorities were aware of the nature and scope of the conspiracy well before they brought it to an end by arresting Reardon and the others, that they could have brought things to an end much earlier than they did, for example before Reardon ever went to Chile, and that Reardon’s criminality was thereby mitigated because the authorities assisted, encouraged or incited him to carry out still more acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
      
       
     227 The evidence establishes that during the latter half of 1997 Reardon and several other members of the conspiracy tried persistently to obtain supplies of cocaine. Crombie went with Martinez to Bolivia to meet Villegas’ brother Arturo. They also met another relative of Villegas called Pedro. Arturo and Pedro, who were just as inexperienced as the other conspirators, agreed to try to find a source of supply. A number of possibilities emerged, the best appearing to be a quantity of ten kilograms said to be available, but only after the payment of a deposit of $US10,000. Crombie returned to Santiago and spoke to Reardon and Alvarez. As a result, pressure was put upon Alvarez to make available $US6,000 to supplement the $US4,000 Crombie could raise so that the deposit could be paid. Alvarez did so.  
      
       
     228 Crombie was not satisfied about the progress of matters and arranged for Martinez to return to Australia and Villegas to travel from Australia to Santiago to try to advance arrangements for the supply. On 9 November there was a meeting between Reardon, Crombie, Villegas and Pedro. The intention was to try to find a new source of supply. On the following day a meeting took place between Villegas, Crombie and other possible suppliers.  
      
       
     229 Whilst he was in Chile Crombie insisted on seeing the money which was to be used to pay for the cocaine. Accordingly, by an arrangement made between the Australian and the Chilean authorities, the sum of $US375,000 was made available for inspection by Crombie.  
      
       
     230 All the members of the conspiracy were becoming concerned that no firm and reliable source of cocaine had been established. Accordingly, on 16 November Reardon informed Purchas that Michaels was a possible supplier. It appears that Michaels had been prepared to fulfil the role of supplier since early in 1997 but that Reardon had preferred to explore other possibilities. It was not until November that members of the law enforcement authorities realised that Michaels was a member of the conspiracy. 
      
       
     231 The summary which I have made does not touch everything that happened but it does show that the members of the conspiracy, including Reardon, needed no encouragement in their attempts to get their hands on a supply of cocaine. The evidence does not establish that anything done on the part of the authorities caused the commission of an act in furtherance of the conspiracy that would not otherwise have been committed. The officers concerned did no more than was necessary to maintain the pretence that Purchas and Alvarez were acting for financiers. Quite early in their arrangements Reardon invited W to put him in contact with a supplier of cocaine but W, directed by Purchas, declined to be involved in that manner. 
      
       
     232 Because of their late emergence, counsel for Reardon had no opportunity to refer in his final submissions to this Court to the running sheet entries referred to in the judgment of Simpson J. However, I have taken them into account in dealing with the submission that Reardon’s criminality was mitigated because the authorities assisted, encouraged or incited his criminal activity. To my mind nothing in those entries establishes that Reardon took any step which he might not have taken but for the conduct of members of the investigating authorities. 
      
       
     233 There were good reasons why the authorities should continue to let the conspirators act. New actors continued to join the conspiracy, for example Arturo and Pedro. The participation of Michaels was not realised until a late stage. The longer the arrangement went on the better the chance the authorities had to infiltrate the Chile and Sydney ends of it and ascertain exactly who was involved. Although the police knew that there was a man at Port Botany who for a fee would arrange for goods to be diverted from Customs inspection, they did not know who that man was. It was imperative that they identify him. The longer the conspiracy were left to run the better were their chances of doing so.  
      
       
     234 It was submitted that the fact that no cocaine was imported mitigated Reardon’s criminality. That was because there was no chance that harm would result from the conspiracy. Reference was made to R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387; R v Irusta [2000] NSWCCA 391. A Court which sentences an offender for conspiracy is entitled to take into account in assessing criminality any act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. This is so even if such an act constitutes the offence conspired at or some other offence: The Queen v Hoar (1981) 148 CLR 32; R v Savvas (No.2) (1991) 58 A Crim R 174. So generally an agreement followed by extensive preparations will be regarded as more serious then a bare agreement. Thus the fact that no cocaine was imported was one to be taken account of in sentencing. 
      
       
     235 Such is the nature of the importation of illegal drugs that very often offenders are detected only because the authorities have foreknowledge of importations, lie in wait and seize goods as they are landed. An examination of the cases does not suggest that there is any sentencing principle which regards the criminality of importers as less because there is no real chance that the drugs they import will be distributed and cause harm to members of the public. Although it would have been different if Reardon had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy, with the result that no harm to the public could result from any further act or intent of his, it seems to me that the absence of any chance of harm does not of itself mitigate his criminality. His intention was always that cocaine should be imported and distributed for profit. The fact that there was never any prospect of harm to the public did not result from any act or intent of Reardon.  
      
       
     236 Of course, Reardon was convicted not of importing but of conspiring to import. In framing the statute which created the offence the Parliament contemplated that persons should receive the punishment provided for though there were no importation: R v Savvas (No.2) per Gleeson CJ at 178. A conspiracy to commit an offence may embrace a far wider body of criminal activity than it might be appropriate to take into account in sentencing for the substantive offence. This might have been just such a case because Reardon’s criminally conspiratorial activity was spread over the better part of a year and involved repeated efforts to effect his purpose. 
      
       
     237 Reardon did not give evidence on sentence, but the report of Anna Robilliard, psychologist, was put before her Honour. The relevant portions of it stated that the applicant’s partner, then aged thirty-five years, had for several years been a chronic migraine sufferer. Reardon was in receipt of a carer’s pension because of the need to support her. She was immobilised on three to four days each week because of headaches and no effective treatment had been found. She had been assessed by several medical experts over the years but effective control could only be achieved by morphine injections. She also suffered from hepatitis C, which she had contracted in hospital. 
      
       
     238 Their six year old son suffered from left-sided hemiplegia. He required a great deal of care, assistance and attention. There was a lesion in the right side of the brain and the left leg was contracted and the left arm virtually paralysed. The child had leg plasters fitted for periods of six months at a time to try to improve the growth and direction of the limb. When it was not in plaster the limb required intensive massage and physiotherapy. Reardon rendered that service.  
      
       
     239 Reardon and his wife had reared as their own her child by a former relationship. At the time of sentence he was about fifteen years old and was staying at home full-time to try and support his mother and care for his half-brother. Ms Robilliard concluded the history by remarking that Reardon felt very guilty about it as he thought that the elder child had a right to his own life at his age.  
      
       
     240 Her Honour found that Reardon provided the sole financial support for his wife and family and that he intended to spend on them the proceeds of the conspiracy. Her Honour did not doubt that Reardon’s wife and son would suffer hardship emotionally and financially because of his confinement to custody but concluded that the degree of hardship was not so extraordinary as to compel a mitigation of the sentence. 
      
       
     241 As appears from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Edwards (1997) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516, 517 the mitigation of a sentence because of the hardship it would cause to persons other than the offender is to be undertaken only in the most exceptional case, when it would in effect be “inhuman” to refuse to do so. See also R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 219 per Wells J at 295-296. Of course, the purpose of mitigating a sentence in such a case would be to alleviate the hardship which so concerned the Court. 
      
       
     242 I do not think that her Honour was wrong in concluding that the hardship resulting to Reardon’s wife and son was not so extraordinary as to compel a mitigation of his sentence. In any case, it is not easy to understand how, if her Honour were wrong, the sentence could have been mitigated in a manner that would alleviate the hardship caused to Reardon’s family. This was an offence of the most serious kind, attracting a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Any sentence less than one incorporating a long period of full-time custody would have been unthinkable. How, one may ask, could the reduction of the head sentence or non-parole period by a few years afford any relief at all to Reardon’s wife and child? The answer, I think, is that it could not. 
      
       
     243 It is convenient to defer for the moment consideration of the remaining grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     244 Her Honour found that Michaels was a conspirator in July 1997, standing ready to find a supplier of cocaine for the enterprise. However, Reardon passed over him in favour of Crombie. When the Crombie arrangement produced nothing Reardon went back to Michaels. Michaels and Purchas spoke on 16 November about the quantity, quality and price of cocaine to be supplied. Michaels told Purchas about his preparedness in the previous July. The two met on the following day and Michaels said that everything on his side was ready, that he could supply fifty kilograms of cocaine and that it could come from Peru, Colombia or Bolivia. On the next day Purchas told Michaels about Alvarez as financier. Michaels floated the idea of cutting out Reardon. On the next day he said that his suppliers would be ready by the end of the week. On 20 November he asked Purchas for a telephone number on which he could speak to Alvarez. The number was supplied. Thereafter, her Honour found, Alvarez received telephone calls from Michaels, pretending to be telephoning from Colombia. 
      
       
     245 An attack was made upon her Honour’s finding that Michaels made arrangements for the supply of cocaine in Chile. It was submitted that there was no evidence that Michaels had ever actually done such a thing. I would not accept this submission. As her Honour found, Michaels told Alvarez that he had organised the supply, that his suppliers were ready. There seems no reason to think that he was not telling the truth. He was a man with experience in the drug industry. The finding was one which her Honour was entitled to make. 
      
       
     246 None of the material lately put forward by Michaels establishes any mitigation of his criminality.  
      
       
     247 Taylor introduced Reardon to Crombie as having contacts in South America and as being able to arrange a supply of cocaine. Between January and July 1997 Taylor and Crombie spoke about a safe method of importing cocaine. Johnson had told Taylor about that. In July or August, Taylor told Crombie that the organiser was in Chile (this was a reference to Reardon) but could not obtain supplies. He asked Crombie whether he could arrange a supply. That is how Crombie came to take on the responsibility to try to arrange a supply of cocaine.  
      
       
     248 Her Honour concluded that Taylor did more that merely introduce Reardon to Crombie, having been interested in the scheme and having spoken to Crombie about it for the first half of the year.  
      
       
     249 On appeal, counsel made submissions similar to those put on behalf of Reardon, that there was no chance of harm because the knowledge and involvement of the law enforcement authorities meant that the cocaine would never be landed and distributed in Australia. The whole enterprise was described as “inept”. I have already dealt with submissions of that kind. 
      
       
     250 Reference was made to R v Kalpaxis [2001] NSWCCA 119, a case in which a lenient sentence was approved by this Court. It was submitted that there were significant similarities between the cases. I disagree. In R v Kalpaxis there was a bare offer to supply one hundred kilograms of cocaine. The offerer had no intention to supply and no ability to supply. The rationale of the judgment of this Court was that the case was not really about the supply of a drug at all. It was a fraud pure and simple. The thing the trickster falsely offered to supply just happened to be a quantity of a drug. The present case is quite different. The activities of the conspirators were ultimately unsuccessful and would not have succeeded, but they intended to supply and went to considerable efforts over a long time to try to do so. Judging by what Michaels told Purchas, a consignment of cocaine would probably have materialised in South America if the conspirators had not been arrested. 
      
       
     251 It is now convenient to compare the sentences, roles and subjective cases of the applicants and other members of the conspiracy. 
      
       
     252 Of the three applicants Reardon played the senior role. He organised the manner of importation and the manner of evading Customs inspection. He was responsible for organising supply and finance. He was forty-nine years old when sentenced. I have mentioned the illness of his wife and son. His history was as a petty criminal (with an old armed robbery). Her Honour found that he had prospects of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     253 Her Honour characterised Michaels’ role as “one that could not be described as minor”. It was submitted that on the evidence her Honour was bound to find that Michaels’ role was subsidiary to that of Reardon, his participation being conditional on Reardon’s decision whether he, Michaels, were “useful” or “necessary” to the furtherance of the conspiracy. Michaels could only remain in the conspiracy as long as Reardon approved. I think that that fairly describes the position Michaels occupied in the conspiracy.  
      
       
     254 Michaels was actively involved in the conspiracy from July onwards. His engagement was for greed. He had not been deterred by sentences imposed before for drug offences. In 1991 he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment for two counts of possessing prohibited imports (cocaine). He was still on parole at the time of this offence. Notwithstanding that history her Honour found prospects of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     255 Taylor brought in Crombie to supply, having been in touch with him over the previous few months. He was fifty-five years old. He had a long record of offences of dishonesty, including old drug offences. In 1989 he had been sentenced to serve a sentence of twelve years with a minimum term of six years for supplying heroin. He was suffering from vascular disease, which led to angina. He had hypertension and emphysema. He suffered from bipolar affective disorder. These conditions were under observation and treatment. He was reported as having suffered a depressive illness of long standing duration.  
      
       
     256 In sentencing Michaels her Honour had regard to the sentence imposed on Crombie because her Honour regarded the roles of the two as about equal. Crombie pleaded guilty and offered substantial assistance to the authorities. But for those features Shillington DCJ QC would have imposed a head sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. 
      
       
     257 Her Honour thought that there were similarities between the roles of Taylor and Cynthia Crombie, who introduced Villegas to the conspiracy as someone who had connections in Chile and who could supply cocaine. Cynthia Crombie also sent money to Chile to form part of the deposit on the proposed supply from Bolivia. She too pleaded guilty and rendered assistance, but for which she would have been sentenced by Shillington DCJ QC to a head sentence of ten years. Her Honour observed that one difference between Taylor and Cynthia Crombie was that he was serving an additional term of a sentence for a drug offence at the time. 
      
       
     258 It seems to me that Reardon has no justifiable sense of grievance by comparison between his sentence and those imposed on the other applicants. As will appear, there is a disparity between his and Michaels’ sentences but I think that Michaels is the one with the justifiable sense of grievance. The maximum sentence was imprisonment for life, and bearing that in mind as well as sentences imposed in other importation and conspiracy cases to which we were referred, I have come to the view that the head sentence of seventeen years eleven months, though long, was not outside her Honour’s range of discretion.  
      
       
     259 In Commonwealth offences the usual proportion of the sentence designated without parole lies within the range 60 to 75%, with the upper part of the range reserved for the worst class of case: R v Paull (1999) NSWLR 427; R v Drazkiewicz New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 12 November 1993 unreported; R v Tack Lee Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474. Although very serious, Reardon’s criminality was not of the worst kind. The non-parole period of fourteen years was about 78% of the head sentence. There were important subjective features to be taken into account when fixing the non-parole period that her Honour did not refer to. There was, for example, the need to foster Reardon’s rehabilitation, which her Honour thought was in prospect. I would have expected her Honour to give reasons for fixing such an exceptionally long non-parole period, yet there was none. 
      
       
     260 I think that her Honour fell into error. I propose that the non-parole period be quashed and that there be substituted a non-parole period of twelve years.  
      
       
     261 As her Honour observed, the fact that Michaels was serving the parole period of an offence of the same kind aggravated his criminality. However, partly by reference to Crombie’s fifteen year head sentence, which her Honour thought comparable, and partly from the very length of the head sentence and comparing it to the role played by Michaels, I think that her Honour must have attached more weight to the feature that it warranted. As a result, I think that the twenty-year head sentence fell outside her Honour’s range of discretion. 
      
       
     262 I would quash the sentence and the non-parole period and substitute a head sentence of eighteen years and a non-parole period of thirteen years. 
      
       
     263 I do not think that the attack by Taylor on his head sentence has been made good, but I think that the non-parole period imposed was outside the range of her Honour’s sentencing discretion because it produced an available period of parole which was insufficient to fulfil the purposes of parole. 
      
       
     264 I would leave his head sentence undisturbed but would quash the non-parole period and substitute a non-parole period of eight years. 
      
       
     265 I propose the following orders - 
      
       
       1. Grant leave to the applicant Reardon to appeal against his sentence and allow the appeal. Quash the non-parole period and fix in lieu a non-parole period of twelve years, which will expire on 22 April 2011. Declare that Reardon will be eligible for release to parole on that day. 
        
       2. Grant leave to the applicant Michaels to appeal against his sentence and allow the appeal. Quash the sentence and impose in lieu a sentence of eighteen years’ imprisonment commencing on 21 November 1997 and expiring on 20 November 2015. Fix a non-parole period of thirteen years which will expire on 20 November 2010. Declare that Michaels will be eligible for release to parole on that day. 
        
       3. Grant leave to the applicant Taylor to appeal against his sentence and allow the appeal. Quash the non-parole period and fix in lieu a non-parole period of eight years which will expire on 20 November 2005. Declare that Taylor will be eligible for release to parole on that day.

      70053/01 - REGINA v SNEZA SUTESKI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 6] - SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 27 February 2002, Ms Sneza Suteski was indicted on ten charges. The first charge was that on 20 December 1999 at Carlton she did murder Richard Peich (s19A Crimes Act 1900). The remaining nine charges were that she had, on various dates between 4 August 1999 and 19 January 2000, obtained a financial benefit by deception (s178BA Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
    2 Ms Suteski pleaded not guilty to murder. However, she pleaded guilty to the nine charges of obtaining a financial benefit by deception. When entering that plea, Ms Suteski asked that an additional 68 offences on a Form 1 be taken into account when she is sentenced. The total amount involved in the deception was $289,075.56. 
     
      
    3 These pleas were entered in front of the jury. The evidence in relation to obtaining a financial benefit by deception formed part of the Crown case in respect of murder. The trial proceeded. On 21 March 2002, the jury found Ms Suteski guilty of murder. 
     
      
    4 It remains for me to now pass sentence. In order to do so, I must determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. In respect to the charge of murder, that determination must be made in a manner consistent with the jury verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Ms Suteski, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities (R v Storey (1996 - 1997) 89 A Crim R 519; Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
       
      The Financial Benefit by Deception Charges 
       
      
    5 Ms Suteski was born on 17 August 1978. In January 1999, she began working for a car dealer known as Newman's of Kogarah. She was the Accounts Payable Clerk. Her function was to receive invoices from suppliers to Newman's and to prepare documentation which would enable their payment. The documentation was submitted to her supervisor, Mr Richard Peich. Mr Peich was employed as an accountant by Newman's. If satisfied with the documentation, Mr Peich would authorise payment. 
     
      
    6 Payment was effected either by cheque or electronically. Many of the regular suppliers to Newman's had furnished their banking details. That information was stored in the company's computer. Once approval had been given, Ms Suteski was required to prepare a floppy disc recording the payments which had been approved, and the party to be paid. The managers at Newman's, by entering certain numbers in the computer, could then access the Newman's bank accounts and, using the floppy disc, could electronically transfer funds from these accounts to the suppliers. 
     
      
    7 Ms Suteski practised her deception in two ways. The first was in the preparation of the floppy disc. Ms Suteski went into the database and changed the bank account number of the supplier to a number she selected. By this means, she diverted money which had been approved for payment to the supplier, to her own account, or that of her brother or boyfriend. On one occasion Ms Suteski diverted $1,791.00 to the account of Mr Ben Sakisi, a person involved in the death of Mr Peich. 
     
      
    8 The second method used by Ms Suteski was to present to Mr Peich, for a second time, invoices which had already been paid. Once approval had been given, the money could then be diverted to an account of her choosing, employing the method described. 
     
      
    9 By this means, Ms Suteski, on 77 separate occasions, obtained a financial benefit by deception, giving rise to the nine counts in the indictment and the 68 matters on the Form 1. 
     
      
    10 The offences began on 15 June 1999, approximately five months after Ms Suteski began at Newman's. The last offence was on 19 January 2000. Ms Suteski was arrested on 24 January 2000. The break-down, month by month, is instructive. It is relevant to the charge of murder. In the period before the murder (which was on 20 December 1999), it was as follows:

    11 After the murder, between 21 December 1999 and 23 December 1999, there were six further offences yielding $31,932.91. 
     
      
    12 The accounts department of Newman's, it appears, closed down over Christmas. It reopened on or about 4 January 2000. Between 4 January 2000 and 19 January 2000 there were eleven further offences, involving $66,774.82. The total amount stolen was, as mentioned, $289,075.56. 
     
      
    13 The offences are plainly serious. They are the more serious because they followed similar conduct in the preceding year. Between January 1998 and April 1998, Ms Suteski practiced a deception upon her then employers, DHL International, diverting over $98,000.00 of its money to her account. The method used to obtain that money was rather less sophisticated than that employed by Ms Suteski at Newman's. At DHL International, she duplicated invoices and presented the duplicates to different managers for approval. Once approved, Ms Suteski made out a cheque payable to cash. The cheque stub was filled out with the name of the supplier to deflect the suspicions of audit staff. The cheques were either cashed or banked in her personal account. 
     
      
    14 The fraud on DHL International was discovered after an internal investigation. Ms Suteski was interviewed. She admitted having taken the money. Her services were terminated on 29 July 1998. A meeting was arranged with her father and her brother on 18 September 1998. DHL chose not to prosecute upon Ms Suteski entering an agreement containing certain conditions. The agreement was signed on 2 October 1998. It incorporated the following conditions: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. Your father, Mr Suteski, is to pay DHL the amount of $98,347.69. 
        
       
       
        
        2. You are to undertake a formal drug counselling programme. ..."" 
        
       
      
    15 The money was duly paid by Ms Suteski's father. Ms Suteski was therefore given a second chance. Within a year (15 June 1999), Ms Suteski again began stealing money from her employer. 
     
      
    16 The criminality involved in the nine offences in the indictment, and those in the Form 1, must take account of the fact that the deception was practiced over eight months, involved 77 separate offences, and yielded the sum of $289,075.56. The Crown suggested that the offences were the worse because of the sophisticated means used to deceive her employer. The commission of the offences certainly required an understanding of computers, which Ms Suteski had. There was evidence that the fraud was difficult to detect. The offences appear to me, however, not terribly sophisticated. Most of the money ($164,608.46) was diverted directly to Ms Suteski's account. The remainder (apart from the cheque to Mr Sakisi), was paid to persons closely associated with Ms Suteski, namely her brother ($105,083.58), and her boyfriend ($17,592.52). It was inevitable that, at some point, suspicions would be aroused. Once aroused, the person responsible was obvious. 
     
      
    17 The maximum penalty under s178BA is five years. Ms Suteski pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial. The sentence which would otherwise be appropriate should be discounted by 10% to reflect that plea (s22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). The offences on the Form 1 will be taken into account in respect of Count 2, in accordance with R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152. 
     
      
    18 I will return to the question of sentence in respect of these offences once I have considered the subjective case of Ms Suteski. 
     
      
       
      Alternative Bases for Murder 
       
      
    19 I will now turn to the conviction for the murder of Mr Richard Peich. Mr Peich died on 20 December 1999. He was repeatedly stabbed by Walid Irani. It was the Crown case that Ms Suteski had procured Mr Irani to harm Mr Peich, and that she was, in law, responsible for his death. That responsibility, on the Crown case, arose in one of two ways. Either: 
     
      
    · Ms Suteski procured Mr Irani to kill or assault Mr Peich with intent that he should suffer grievous bodily harm; or 
     
      
    · She procured some lesser form of assault (falling short of grievous bodily harm) yet contemplated the possibility that, in the course of carrying out that assault, Mr Irani may use a dangerous weapon such as a knife, with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Peich. 
     
      
    20 The jury simply returned a verdict of guilty of murder. That verdict signified an acceptance, beyond reasonable doubt, of one or other of these alternatives. There is a significant difference in the moral culpability attaching to each. Before passing sentence, I must determine, upon the basis of the evidence, the nature of the attack upon Mr Peich which Ms Suteski procured. Only then can a selection be made between the alternatives (Cheung v The Queen (2001) 76 ALJR 133, per Gleeson CJ, Gummow & Hayne JJ at paras 5 and 8). Mr Byrne SC, for Ms Suteski, urged the second of these alternatives. 
     
      
       
      The Nature of the Assault Procured 
       
      
    21 Ms Suteski did not give evidence at the trial. Nor did she give evidence on sentence. When interviewed by the police, she declined to answer questions until she had spoken to her solicitor. However, she did make the following comment in the course of that interview: (Exhibit J, Q51) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... Things went out of hand and I, I don't know what happened, so, but I did not kill him."" 
        
       
      
    22 The Crown case included evidence from Ms Suteski's boyfriend, Mr Bradley Barnes. Mr Barnes gave evidence of a telephone conversation with Ms Suteski on 29 January 2000, a matter of days after her arrest. He said this: (T313) 
     
      
       
        
        "" A. ... I asked her why she couldn't come home, why she was in trouble for? She briefly explained to me that some guys, she had some guys to rough up a guy from her work and they stuffed up and killed him. ..."" 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Barnes was not cross examined on that evidence. The trial was conducted on behalf of Ms Suteski upon the basis that some form of attack had been procured by her upon Mr Peich. The issue posed to the jury by Mr Byrne SC (appearing for Ms Suteski) was: What kind of attack was it that Ms Suteski had ordered? 
     
      
    24 Having been convicted, Ms Suteski was interviewed by Ms Hammond of the Probation and Parole Service. The report prepared by that Service included the following statement which she made in the course of that interview: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She stated that she only ever sought to have the victim 'bashed', the definition of which she offered as 'a black eye'."" 
        
       
      
    25 The account Ms Suteski gave a psychologist, Ms Barrier, on 29 April 2002 was rather more elaborate. The report prepared by Ms Barrier to assist on sentence, included the following: (Exhibit 1, p6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Sneza stated that the deceased was Mr Peich, an accountant at Newman's Motors. He sat behind her in the office and often observed her work practices. She needed him away for a couple of days so she could 'cover my tracks' in relation to the fraudulent offences she had been committing. She had spoken to her friend Kaycee Salem about this and she had in turn introduced Sneza to her boyfriend Ben Sakisi. He agreed to have Mr Peich 'bashed'. Sakisi then hired Walid Irani. Subsequently Irani had assaulted Mr Peich and during the course of that assault, had stabbed him six times in the chest. Mr Peich died of his wounds. 
        
       
       
        
        Sneza stated it was never her intention that Mr Peich be killed."" 
        
       
      
    26 On the Crown case, there were four persons involved in the crime which culminated in the death of Mr Peich. They were: 
     
      
    · Ms Suteski who procured the crime. 
     
      
    · Her hairdresser, Ms Kaycee Salem, whom she approached for assistance. 
     
      
    · Mr Ben Sakisi, the boyfriend of Ms Salem, a drug dealer who arranged for the assault to be carried out. 
     
      
    · Mr Walid Irani, recruited by Mr Sakisi, and the person who stabbed Mr Peich, thereby causing his death. 
     
      
    27 It was common ground that the crime procured was some form of bashing rather than the death of Mr Peich. The issue for the jury, and ultimately for me, was how severe was the bashing which Ms Suteski ordered? Two matters were identified as convenient indices of the severity of the bashing procured. The first concerned discussions which were said to have taken place concerning the weapons that might be used in the course of the assault. The Crown contended that Ms Suteski gave those who were to carry out the bashing a ""blank cheque"", knowing the sorts of weapons that might be used. 
     
      
    28 The second index of severity was the time that Mr Peich was expected to be off work as a consequence of the injuries inflicted. Was it a matter of days, as suggested by Ms Suteski to Ms Barrier, the psychologist, or was it a matter of weeks, as other witnesses had testified? 
     
      
    29 Ms Kaycee Salem gave the following evidence of a conversation with Ms Suteski at the hairdressing salon approximately one month before Mr Peich's death: (T174) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What did she ask you? 
         
        A. She asked me if I knew anyone that could hurt somebody at her work. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. And I said 'No'. She said, 'Could you ask Ben', and I said 'no', not to ask him, because I didn't want him to have anything to do with it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn't want him to get into trouble? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say how she wanted someone hurt, what she wanted done to them? 
         
        A. She just said that she wanted someone hurt at work; she didn't want him dead, she just wanted him stabbed or broken arms or something like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say why she wanted this person hurt by being 'stabbed or broken arms or something like that'? 
         
        A. So she could steal some money."" 
        
       
      
    30 Ms Salem's evidence must be approached with caution. She was, arguably, an accomplice. She received an indemnity in return for undertaking that she would give evidence for the Crown. There were significant discrepancies on other aspects of her evidence. When giving evidence at the committal, Ms Salem testified that Ms Suteski said nothing about wanting Mr Peich stabbed. She added, when giving evidence in the present trial, that she recognised that she had made a mistake on that issue as she walked out of court. Stabbing was mentioned. 
     
      
    31 Mr Irani gave evidence for the Crown. He said that he was first approached by Mr Sakisi. He was told that someone wanted someone bashed, ""a broken arm or broken leg or something"". The person bashed was to be away from work for ""one, two or three weeks"", to enable certain frauds to be perpetrated. He would be paid $2000 or $3000. Mr Irani agreed to do the job. Arrangements were then made for him to meet Ms Suteski. They met, according to his testimony, at Ms Salem's flat in Rockdale about three weeks before the murder. Mr Sakisi was present, as was Ms Salem, who was in the background. During the meeting, the following conversation took place, according to Mr Irani: (T47) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And the second thing was how they wanted him hurt. Who described that? 
         
        A. Well, they didn't - I asked what they wanted, like what kind of injury. They didn't say for sure. They just said, just - I asked whether baseball bat or knife or just punch him or whatever, you know how I mean, and they didn't say for sure what. It was up to me."" 
        
       
      
    32 Mr Irani added, referring to Ms Suteski: (T48) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Well, I asked 'How did you want this guy hurt?', and she just said, 'Bash him. Stab him. Kill him. I don't give a fuck what you do to him, as long as he doesn't show up for work.'"" 
        
       
      
    33 Mr Irani's evidence must also be approached with caution. He was an accomplice. Indeed, he acknowledged having stabbed Mr Richard Peich. He pleaded guilty to murder. When being sentenced, he had offered to assist the Crown. The sentence imposed upon him had been discounted significantly in recognition of that assistance. Mr Irani also had a number of criminal convictions. He was a drug addict. His account on some issues varied significantly. He acknowledged that counsel appearing for him on sentence had suggested that the incident started out (and was, inferentially, in the mind of Ms Suteski) as something relatively minor; something that got completely out of hand, a ""touch up"", a ""roughing up"" of Mr Peich. 
     
      
    34 Ms Salem's evidence provided no corroboration of the account given by Mr Irani. She recalled an occasion where Ms Suteski came to her flat at the Rockdale Plaza and spoke with Mr Sakisi and Mr Irani. However, according to her testimony, the meeting took place on the night of the murder, not three weeks before. She was not a party to the conversation. She could give no evidence as to what was said. 
     
      
    35 Mr Sakisi did not give evidence. However, a video interview with him conducted by the police on 25 January 2000 was tendered (Exhibit N). It provided a measure of support for the account of Mr Irani. Mr Sakisi said that Ms Suteski wanted Mr Peich off work for two weeks (Q85). They were to be paid $2000 or $3000 (Q91). The interview included the following: (Exhibit N) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q279 I've been told that Snez said words to the effect of break his knees or his legs, do you recall her saying that? 
         
        A. Beg yours? 
        
       
       
        
        Q280 Break his knees or his legs? 
         
        A. She wanted something like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q281 Right. 
         
        A. Something, like, that was - "" 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Sakisi was also an accomplice. He pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment by Barr J on 15 June 2001. He had other serious convictions. He was a drug dealer. He was, of course, not cross examined. 
     
      
    37 I have no doubt that Mr Irani did not set out to kill Mr Peich and had not been procured by Ms Suteski to do so. The best guide to what he had been commissioned to do was what he did. He armed himself with a hammer. The hammer had a metal head and a wooden handle. Within the car, which he had used to travel to the St George Leagues Club, he had a knife. The knife had been left in the car by Mr Sakisi a short time before. Before setting out for the club, Mr Irani placed the knife inside a sock in case it fell to the ground, so that he could better see it in the dark.  
     
      
    38 Mr Irani lay in wait for Mr Peich at the club on the night of 20 December 1999. As he waited outside the car, he probably did not, at that point, have the knife with him. He described what he intended in these words, which I accept: (T58) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What were you going to do with the hammer? 
         
        A. Strike him on the head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where? On the? 
         
        A. On the head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you hoping to do by striking him on the head? 
         
        A. Just injure him. Maybe give him a fractured skull or something."" 
        
       
      
    39 When Mr Peich emerged from the club he was with a woman. There was a security guard nearby. Mr Irani therefore abandoned his plan to strike Mr Peich at the club. He drove to Mr Peich's home, which was nearby. He parked the car. He armed himself with the hammer. He also took the knife, which was inside the sock. As he passed Mr Peich on the footpath, he turned and struck him with a hammer on the back of the head. Mr Irani said that he was expecting Mr Peich to immediately lose consciousness. Instead, he remained on his feet. Indeed, he turned around and looked at Mr Irani shocked. Mr Irani struck him again. He did so with such force that the hammer broke and fell to the ground. Still Mr Peich did not fall. Indeed, he endeavoured to defend himself, hitting Mr Irani. Mr Irani then lunged at him a number of times with the knife, penetrating his heart and bringing about his death almost at once. 
     
      
    40 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the assault procured by Ms Suteski involved inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Peich. I accept that weapons were discussed, including baseball bats and knives, and that Ms Suteski was content to leave it to Mr Irani. I accept that Ms Suteski's purpose, or a substantial part of her purpose, in arranging the assault, was to perpetrate further fraud, as she duly did. Indeed, on the day she learned of Mr Peich's death, 21 December 1999, Ms Suteski committed a further four offences, yielding her $21,788.26. I accept that, to accomplish her objective, Ms Suteski required Mr Peich to be away from work for about two weeks. She could not, by the method which she had perfected, steal more than several thousand dollars at a time, without fear of arousing suspicion. She therefore needed time, at least two weeks, to accumulate the sizeable amount which she intended to, and did, divert from her employer's funds into her own. That two weeks is a convenient index to the level of violence that Ms Suteski had in mind. The use of the hammer by Mr Irani was, I believe, well within her instructions, as was the use of a dangerous weapon, such as a knife. Part of her purpose may also have been ""to cover her tracks"", as she alleged. 
     
      
    41 Quite apart from procuring this crime, Ms Suteski gave assistance in its execution. She provided Mr Sakisi and Mr Irani with information which would enable them to identify Mr Peich. She provided a description of Mr Peich, his age, his address, his telephone number, his car registration, and his habits, including his habit of attending the St George Leagues Club. Ms Suteski identified his car in the carpark of the St George Leagues Club, although there is some uncertainty as to when that was done. 
     
      
    42 On the night of the murder, Ms Suteski accompanied Mr Sakisi to the club. The Crown case included video surveillance footage from cameras within the club. They showed the vehicle of Ms Suteski arriving with Mr Sakisi at the club at 7.07 pm. Mr Peich was already in the club. He remained within the club for a number of hours. Throughout that time, mobile phone records show phone calls between Mr Sakisi and Mr Irani (who was in the carpark) during the evening. 
     
      
    43 At 10.20 pm Mr Sakisi left the club. The video surveillance shows him leaving by car at 10.21 pm. Ms Suteski remained behind. Mr Peich, as it happened, decided to leave the club soon after. The video showed him in the foyer of the club at 10.26 pm. Shortly before he entered the foyer, but after Mr Sakisi had already left, the mobile phone records show a call at 10.24 pm on Ms Suteski's phone to Mr Irani's phone. I infer that Ms Suteski made that call, alerting Mr Irani to the fact that Mr Peich was at last leaving. 
     
      
    44 Mr Byrne SC, for Ms Suteski, pointed out that Mr Irani did not suggest that the call came from Ms Suteski. He said that it came from Mr Sakisi. However, on that aspect, I believe he is mistaken. I am satisfied that the call at 10.24 pm came from Ms Suteski. 
     
      
       
      The Objective Seriousness of the Offence 
       
      
    45 This was not a contract killing. It was, however, a contract to carry out a very serious assault, inflicting grievous bodily harm, upon an unsuspecting and blameless individual. It was a contract which led to his death. 
     
      
    46 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. Mr Peich was, on all accounts, a good man and a loyal employee. His mother, and members of his family, have attended court each day throughout this trial. One can only imagine their agony and sympathise with their loss. However, the sorrow of those who remain behind is not a matter which I should take into account, and I do not do so (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85). 
     
      
    47 Before considering an appropriate sentence in respect of the various charges for which Ms Suteski stands convicted, I should turn to the personal circumstances of Ms Suteski, relevant to murder, and also to the charges involving fraud, to which she pleaded guilty. 
     
      
       
      The Subjective Circumstances of Ms Suteski 
       
      
    48 Ms Suteski is now almost 24 years. She was born in Australia of Macedonian parents. Her parents are described as hard working. They provided a good home. Ms Suteski is said to be quite intelligent. She completed the Higher School Certificate and an accountancy diploma. Her life was uneventful until the difficulties with DHL International in 1998. Two problems emerged at about that time. The first was drug taking, and the second gambling. Ms Suteski emphatically denied drug taking in recent interviews, both to the Probation and Parole Officer, Ms Hammond, and the psychologist, Ms Barrier. However, the Agreement of 2 October 1998 with DHL International, which she signed, suggested drugs may have been a problem. Gambling was certainly a problem by 1999, both on poker machines and at the Casino. 
     
      
    49 The psychologist, Ms Barrier, administered tests which suggested that Ms Suteski does, to a degree, suffer from major depression. 
     
      
    50 Dealing with contrition, Ms Hammond, the Probation Officer, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She displayed little contrition when discussing her offending behaviour."" 
        
       
      
    51 Ms Barrier made the same observation. She said: (p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Her personality test results indicate a self involved individual who would exhibit an intrinsic unfeeling cold quality. She would have little investment in close personal relationships and limited insights into the effect of her behaviour on others. Her minimal expressions of remorse are consistent with her personality construct."" 
        
       
      
    52 Ms Suteski has not shown any real remorse. She has yet to acknowledge responsibility for the shocking crime which she procured, and which led to the death of Mr Peich. The statement to Ms Hammond that she had in mind for Mr Peich ""something like a black eye"" illustrates her difficulty. It is plain that she intended something much worse, significant injury, something which would prevent Mr Peich attending work for at least two weeks. 
     
      
    53 I have been urged to find special circumstances (s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Ms Suteski is a relatively young woman. She plainly has a problem with gambling, if not drugs. She may well benefit from an extended period of supervision. In other circumstances, a finding of special circumstances would be justified. However, necessarily, the parole period must itself be significant, and is sufficient in my view without adjustment. 
     
      
       
      Parity of Sentencing 
       
      
    54 Mr Irani pleaded guilty to murder before Barr J. On 15 June 2001 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years, with a non parole period of 15 years. The sentencing Judge made a number of observations and findings which are relevant to an understanding of the sentence which he imposed, namely: 
     
      
    · First, that Mr Irani was almost 20 years old at the time he murdered Mr Peich. 
     
      
    · Second, that he was a drug addict, addicted to heroin. He found the offer of money to assault Mr Peich a temptation which was irresistible. 
     
      
    · Third, that he had demonstrated, including by his plea of guilty, some contrition. His Honour, nonetheless, had some hesitation in accepting Mr Irani's expressions of remorse. 
     
      
    · Fourth, that Mr Irani had offered to provide assistance, which was both significant and useful. 
     
      
    · Fifth, that the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty and the offer of assistance was 40%. 
     
      
    · Sixth, that Mr Irani's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable, if he were able to put the drug problems behind him. 
     
      
    55 In these circumstances, Barr J said this (R v Irani; R v Sakisi [2001] NSWSC 475): (para 28) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A contract murder done with intent to kill would have attracted the maximum sentence. No allowance would be appropriate for the offender's addiction to drugs and what he saw as his lack of choice when offered money for his services. Of course, this was not a contract to kill and I am obliged to sentence the offender upon the basis that he agreed and intended only to do Mr Peich grievous bodily harm. That removes this murder from the worst category of murders, but the crime was still very serious because Irani acted in cold blood and for reward and planned his attack with a great deal of care."" 
        
       
      
    56 The sentence imposed, therefore, reflected a starting point of 33-1/3 years before applying the 40% discount. 
     
      
    57 Mr Irani appealed against that sentence. He asserted that it was too severe. The Court of Criminal Appeal (R v Irani [2002] NSWCCA 153) (Sheller JA, Levine and Simpson JJ) dismissed the appeal. Simpson J, with whom other members of the Court agreed, said this: (para 26) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am unable to conclude that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I am not satisfied, firstly, that the starting point of thirty three and one third years was, for what was in essence a contract killing (although not intended to be a killing) was outside the range properly available (although I accept that it was a heavy starting point); I am not satisfied, secondly, that the applicant's plea of guilty or his assistance warranted a more substantial discount than a total of 40%; and I am far from satisfied that the sentence ultimately imposed did other than recognise the objective seriousness of the applicant's crime."" 
        
       
      
    58 Her Honour added: (para 30) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my opinion the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive and was a proper one to reflect all of the circumstances. The sentencing remarks show that all relevant factors were taken into account. Another judge may have given more weight to some circumstances resulting in a lower sentence, but that is not of itself indicative of error. No error has been identified. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal."" 
        
       
      
    59 Mr Sakisi also pleaded guilty before Barr J. The plea was entered to the alternative charge of accessory before the fact of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr Sakisi was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non parole period of 7 years. In his sentencing remarks, Barr J said this: (para 39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""For sentencing purposes the fact of the unfortunate death of Mr Peich must be put aside. The offence of which Sakisi has been convicted contemplated only the infliction of grievous bodily harm. The criminality involved the meetings and planning to which I have referred. It was done coolly and for financial gain and in utter contempt of Mr Peich, a man whom Sakisi did not know and who had done him no offence. These features combine to make the offence a very serious one of its kind. ..."" 
        
       
      
    60 Mr Byrne SC, in his submissions on behalf of Ms Suteski, urged that the sentence of Mr Sakisi was a better guide, in the context of Ms Suteski, than the sentence of Mr Irani. Indeed, he argued that the criminality involved in the crime of Mr Sakisi was greater than that of Ms Suteski, since Mr Sakisi, but not Ms Suteski, intended grievous bodily harm. That argument obviously presupposes an acceptance of the alternative basis for the verdict of murder, that is a lesser form of assault, not involving grievous bodily harm. I have, however, rejected that alternative. I believe Ms Suteski intended, and procured, an assault with grievous bodily harm. The charge against Mr Sakisi was therefore a different and lesser charge. In determining the appropriate sentence for Ms Suteski, I do not find great assistance from the sentence imposed upon Mr Sakisi. 
     
      
    61 The sentence upon Mr Irani is a better guide. Each shared the common purpose to assault Mr Peich, causing grievous bodily harm. The moral culpability of Ms Suteski, as the procurer, is arguably greater than that of Mr Irani. Here, I believe the criminality on the part of Ms Suteski is at least that of Mr Irani. There was a cold premeditation and persistence in her actions. She was to be the beneficiary of Mr Peich's disablement. 
     
      
    62 Barr J, when sentencing Mr Irani, selected a sentence of 33 -1/3 years as reflecting the objective criminality of his crime. That was characterised as a ""very heavy starting point"" by the Court of Criminal Appeal, but not one which was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    63 I believe with respect, however, that a starting point exceeding 30 years is excessive. In R v Baartman (unreported, 18.12.98) Dunford J sentenced John Baartman for murder after a retrial. John Baartman and Paul Crofts had been charged with murder. They undertook a contract shooting of a person, ""Tony"", who lived in Lugarno. Their instructions were to shoot him in the leg. They were provided with his address. The crime, in its execution, went badly wrong. Mr Baartman and his companion went to the wrong house. They shot the wrong man. The man they shot was shot in the abdomen, not the leg. He died almost at once. 
     
      
    64 After the first trial before Abadee J and a jury, Mr Baartman was convicted. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 15 years. There was a successful appeal and a retrial before Dunford J. Paul Crofts, in the meantime, had pleaded guilty to murder before Grove J. Grove J expressed the view that objectively the appropriate penalty was of the order of 30 years penal servitude. Given the sentence of Mr Baartman, Grove J sentenced Paul Crofts to the same term of imprisonment and non parole period. 
     
      
    65 Dunford J, when resentencing Mr Baartman, expressed some sympathy for the views expressed by Grove J. However, being a resentence, he reimposed the same sentence originally imposed by Abadee J. The use of a gun in that case, in my view, made the planned assault significantly worse and more dangerous than the assault upon Mr Peich. 
     
      
    66 Submissions on sentence in this matter were made on 3 May 2002. The Irani appeal was listed for hearing before the Court of Criminal Appeal on 6 May 2002. I was urged by counsel not to sentence Ms Suteski until after the Court of Criminal Appeal had delivered its judgment. At the time that seemed to me sensible. I believe the Court of Criminal Appeal was told that I had heard submissions, and was awaiting the result of the Irani appeal. It therefore delivered its reasons with despatch, dismissing the appeal. 
     
      
    67 However, with hindsight, I believe it was unfortunate that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not postpone its determination of the sentence appeal by Mr Irani until after Ms Suteski had been sentenced. There was no urgency in Mr Irani's appeal. In determining Mr Irani's appeal, and any appeal by Ms Suteski, the Court would then have had a range of views from which it could determine whether either sentence was excessive or inadequate and whether either had a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
       
      The Appropriate Sentence 
       
      
    68 In fixing upon a sentence it is necessary that separate sentences be identified in respect of each count. In determining such sentences, I should have regard to the principle of totality, giving consideration at the same time to whether the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative (Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610). 
     
      
    69 Mr Byrne SC, on behalf of Ms Suteski, urged that the sentences should be concurrent, with some adjustment to recognise the overall criminality. Although there are common aspects, I believe it appropriate to partially accumulate the sentences on the fraud charges. 
     
      
    70 I will structure the sentences shortly to conform with Pearce. I should take account of 36 days imprisonment from Ms Suteski's arrest on 24 January 2000 to her release on bail on 1 March 2000. I revoked bail on Monday 25 February 2002. The sentences will date from that time. The overall sentence, including a partial accumulation of two years on the fraud charges, is 24 years with a non parole period of 18 years. I have subtracted the 36 days from the termination date, both for the non-parole period and the total sentence. 
     
      
    71 SNEZA SUTESKI, you are sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. On Count 2, including the Form 1, to a term of imprisonment of 4-1/2 years commencing on 25 February 2002 and ending on 24 August 2006, with a non parole period of 3 years commencing on 25 February 2002 and ending on 24 February 2005. 
       
       
      2. On Counts 3 to 10 inclusive, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 25 February 2002 and ending on 24 February 2005, concurrent. 
       
       
      3. On Count 1, murder, a term of imprisonment of 22 years less the 36 days before your release on bail on 1 March 2001, commencing on 25 February 2004 and ending on 20 January 2026; with a non parole period of 16 years (less the 36 days) commencing on 25 February 2004, and ending on 20 January 2020.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 15 August 2001 in the District Court at Sydney, two accused, namely Natesan Narayanan and a company Singapore Exchange & Finance Pty. Limited (SEF), appeared before Holt ADCJ, each charged with offences against the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (FTR Act).  
      
       
     2 The indictment contained fifty-eight charges in all, comprising twenty-eight charges against each accused alleging offences against s.31(1) of the FTR Act, and one charge against each accused alleging an offence under s.28(1)(a) of the FTR Act. In relation to all charges, SEF was charged as principal and Narayanan was charged as having procured the offence by SEF (pursuant to s.7 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)).

       BACKGROUND AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
       
     8 SEF was a company whose business included currency exchange and sale of travellers cheques. It had a number of offices in Sydney, with its head office at Centrepoint Tower. It was a “cash dealer” for the purposes of the FTR Act. Narayanan was CEO and a director and shareholder of SEF.  
      
       
     9 The FTR Act makes provision for the monitoring of movements of large amounts of cash. Cash dealers are required to report particulars of “significant cash transactions”; and the Act also makes it an offence to attempt to avoid the operation of the Act by structuring transactions.  
      
       
     10 Section 3 of the Act contains the following relevant definitions: 
      
       
        
         
         ""cash transaction"" means a transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another.  
          
          
         ""currency"" means the coin and paper money of Australia or of a foreign country that:  
          
         (a) is designated as legal tender; and  
          
         (b) circulates as, and is customarily used and accepted as, a medium of exchange in the country of issue.  
          
          
         ""non-reportable cash transaction"" means a cash transaction:  
          
         (a) to which a cash dealer is a party; and  
          
         (b) that is not a significant cash transaction or is an exempt cash transaction.  
          
          
         ""significant cash transaction"" means a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value. 
         
        
       
     11 Section 7 of the Act requires cash dealers to report significant cash transactions. Section 7(1) is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         7(1) Where a cash dealer is a party to a significant cash transaction, the dealer shall, before the end of the reporting period:  
          
         (a) prepare a report of the transaction; and  
          
         (b) communicate the information contained in the report to the Director;  
          
         unless:  
          
         (c) the transaction is, at the time when it occurs, an exempt transaction; or  
          
         (d) the transaction is, at the time when it occurs, eligible for exemption and becomes, before the end of the reporting period, an exempt transaction; or  
          
         (e) the cash dealer is an approved cash carrier.  
         
        
       
     12 Section 7 occurs in Part II of the Act. Sections 9 and 10 deal with exempt transactions and transactions eligible for exemption: it is common ground that these sections have no application in this case.  
      
       
     13 Section 28 of the Act provides for an offence when a cash dealer fails to provide the information required under Part II. Section 28(1)(a) is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         28(1) A cash dealer commits an offence against this section if the cash dealer refuses or fails:  
          
         (a) to communicate information to the Director when and as required under Part II or III; or  
          
         … 
         
        
       
     14 Section 31(1) makes it an offence to conduct transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements: it is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         31(1) A person commits an offence against this section if:  
          
         (a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and  
          
         (b) having regard to:  
          
           
           (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following:  
            
             
             (A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction;  
              
             (B) the aggregated value of the transactions;  
              
             (C) the period of time over which the transactions took place;  
              
             (D) the interval of time between any of the transactions;  
              
             (E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and  
             
            
           (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted;  
            
           it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that:  
            
           (iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or  
            
           (iv) would give rise to exempt cash transactions.  
           
          
         
        
       
     15 The offence created by this provision is sometimes called structuring.  
      
       
        
       CHARGES 
       
     16 The charges on which the appellants were convicted under s.31(1) of the FTR Act were in similar terms, apart from variations in the number of non-reportable cash transactions alleged.  
      
       
     17 In count 51, it was charged that Narayanan:

Limited (“the company”) namely that on 6 September 1999 the company was party to five non-reportable cash transactions which the company conducted in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure that the currency involved in the transaction was transferred in a manner that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. 
         
        
       
     18 In count 52, it was charged that SEF:

     19 The charges on which the appellants were convicted under s.28(1) were in the following terms. 
      
       
     20 In count 57, it was charged that Narayanan: 
      
       
        
         
         Between about 17 August 1999 and about 2 September 1999 procured the commission of an offence by Singapore Exchange & Finance Pty.

     21 In count 58, it was charged that SEF: 
      
       
        
         
         Between about 17 August 1999 and about 2 September 1999, being a cash dealer, failed to communicate information to the director of AUSTRAC as required under part II of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, namely that on 17 August 1999 the company was party to a cash transaction involving the transfer to it by a person unknown of US$40,000.  
         
        
        
       THE CROWN CASE 
       
     22 An important witness for the Crown was Usha Malik, a former SEF employee and an indemnified witness. She had been employed at SEF at the relevant time as a foreign exchange teller and she had also done some work on the company accounts. Her evidence concerned the manner in which transactions were conducted by SEF in particular in relation to transactions involving currency in excess of A$10,000.00, and also Narayanan’s role in the company.  
      
       
     23 Ms. Malik gave evidence that, in relation to transactions involving $10,000.00 or more, the practice was to ask the customer if the customer wanted a cash transaction form to be completed; and if the customer did not want this, she would contact Mr. Narayanan or a Ms. Indu Ram, who would give a higher rate for the transaction. In particular, she gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. If you receive instructions not to complete the form, and by form what did you understand the form that needed to be completed?  
          
         A. The cash transaction report one, that more than 10,000, the green form you showed me. 
          
          
         Q. What was the procedure if the form wasn't to be completed? 
          
         A. Then Mr Nat or Indu Ram give us another rate which would normally be extra than the normal rate, and we would give that rate to the customer and if he is happy we would do that transaction. 
          
          
         Q. And would you enter that transaction on the computer? 
          
         A. First Mr Nat or Indu will break the transaction less than 10,000, the amount 10,000 each and then we will enter into the computer. 
          
          
         Q. What would you enter into the computer? Suppose someone came along and said they had $20,000 in US currency and asked to change it into Australian dollars. You say, as I understood you, you would ring upstairs and you would either speak to Ms Ram or the accused, is that right? 
          
         A. That's right. 
          
          
         Q. And if the transaction went ahead it would be broken up? 
          
         A. That's right. 
          
          
         Q. And who would complete the documentation for the computer if anybody in such a situation? 
          
         A. Normally it would be held upstairs and done by Ms Indu Ram in the Head Office or Mr Nat himself sometimes. 
          
          
         Q. So as a teller dealing with such a transaction you wouldn't enter anything on to a computer? 
          
         A. No, normally if it was 20,000 they would not enter into the branch, it would be done at Head office. 
          
          
         Q. More than 20,000 it would be done at Head Office? 
          
         A. Yes, if it is 20,000 of course it would be done at Head Office- 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Q. If it is 10,000 or 11,000?  
          
         A. It depends what they want, what Mr Nat wanted to do. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Suppose if a customer was prepared to fill the details in. What would happen on that occasion if you had to fill in the financial transaction report details?  
          
         A. They would get the normal rate, the same. We will ask upstairs, and say ""yes, the customer is filling the form"" and we will get the normal rate and the whole amount will be entered. It can be done in the booth. Mostly it is in the booth if the form is filled out. 
          
          
         Q. So you perform the transaction in the booth if the customer was prepared to fill in the details? 
          
         A. Yeah, if customer comes to booth, yes. 
          
          
         Q. Whilst you were employed in the booths as a teller, on how many occasions can you recall handling a transaction involving more than $10,000 Australian dollars? 
          
         A. I don't remember how many, but maybe twice a week or like that, I don't remember. 
         
        
       
     24 Ms. Malik also gave evidence of the particular events relied on by the Crown to support counts 51 to 54, which concerned two transactions (or groups of transactions) with a person called Tony. 
      
       
     25 Counts 51 and 52 concerned the purchase by Tony of travellers cheques for $43,600.00. Ms. Malik gave evidence to the effect that, on 3 September 1999, Tony paid $14,000.00 as a “deposit” for a proposed transaction; and that she was present at a meeting on that day between Tony and Narayanan, during which Tony said he did not want to fill in any forms and Narayanan said words to the effect: “If you don’t want to fill in the form how can I give you a good rate, let’s make a deal. You help us and we help you”, after which Narayanan gave an exchange rate saying “this is the exchange rate if you don’t want to fill in the form”.  
      
       
     26 Ms. Malik gave evidence that Tony came to SEF’s office on 6 September at about 12.30pm. Ms. Malik obtained travellers cheques from Ms. Ram, who gave instructions to her to tell Tony to put whatever names he liked on the travellers cheques. She then spoke to Tony, gave him green American Express purchase records and sales receipts to fill out. He then filled them out and signed them in a number of different names.  
      
       
     27 Copies of these documents are in evidence. They show that twenty-five $100 cheques and one $1,000 cheque was obtained in the name of Patrick Hoffman, 1/6 Hunter St. Ives; that fifty $100 cheques were obtained in the name of Tony Collins, 8 Victoria, Manly; that six $1,000 cheques were obtained in the name of Albert Rafter, 20 Manly Road, Manly; that six $1,000 cheques were obtained in the name of George Davis, 54 Victory Parade, Manly; and that six $1,000 cheques were obtained in the name of John Adams, 54 Punch Bowl, St. Ives. All these cheques were in US currency.  
      
       
     28 Ms. Malik handed over the travellers cheques, and took cash in exchange which, together with the $14,000.00 paid previously, amounted to $43,600.00. She then went upstairs and handed the cash to a Mr. Krishnamurty and the documents to Ms. Ram. This occurred at about 1pm. She did not enter the transactions on the computer at that time. There were in evidence computer records of SEF purporting to show the following transactions, all on 6 September 1999, relating to the issue of American Express travellers cheques at specified times for specified amounts of foreign currency, at specified exchange rates and for specified amounts of Australian dollars. These records show the following:

     29 It is plain that lines 1, 2 and 5 related to the American Express cheques in the name of Rafter, Davis and Adams; line 3 to American Express cheques in the name of Collins; and line 4 to American Express cheques in the name of Hoffman. Cheques to the total of US$26,500.00 were handed to Tony, in return for cash totalling $43,600.00.  
      
       
     30 Ms. Malik gave evidence that she made entries in a book called the sellers register. These entries are in evidence, originally dated 9/9 but altered to 6/9. They show twenty-five $100 cheques issued to Patrick Hoffman; fifty $100 cheques issued to Tony Collins; six $1,000 cheques issued to each of John Adams, George Davis and Albert Rafter; and one $1,000 cheque issued to Patrick Hoffman.  
      
       
     31 In relation to the different exchange rates shown in the computer printout, Ms. Malik gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. And each of these transactions appears to have a slightly different exchange rate is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Did you give a different exchange rate for any of the transactions you conducted with Tony? 
          
         A. No it was the same rate but we put different, to just make it like it is not the one transaction. Australian amount should be the same so accordingly we put the rate to the transactions. 
          
          
         Q. So do you say that this document is made to appear that there were five transactions where in fact there was only one? 
          
         A. That is right. 
          
          
         Q. And does the time difference of just a few seconds for each one does that indicate anything to you in relation to these sorts of documents generally? 
          
         A. Yes because normally we don't get customer, like one second like that, so time difference also shows me that this is one transaction. 
         
        
       
     32 There was evidence to similar effect regarding counts 53 and 54. There were similar computer documents in evidence concerning counts 39 and 40, which concerned a transaction (or group of transactions) with a person called George. 
      
       
     33 In relation to counts 57 and 58, which concerned the same transaction (or group of transactions) as counts 39 and 40, evidence was given by two other former employees of SEF, namely Michaela Spejchalova and Marek Rybar.  
      
       
     34 Ms. Spejchalova’s evidence was that she was asked by Narayanan to stay behind on 18 August 1999 to conduct a special transaction. She was told that a man called George would come in and that a transaction had already been arranged. Her boyfriend Marek Rybar who also worked for SEF was to help her with the transaction. She gave evidence that Narayanan arrived with about US$40,000.00 and that she and Marek counted it. She and Marek completed a Cash Transaction Form and made a computer entry. She said that Narayanan returned and said that the transaction had already been arranged at head office and that there was no need for the form or the computer entries. She then deleted the computer entry. George subsequently arrived with a bag of Australian currency which was counted. Narayanan was then given the Australian currency and George was given the US$40,000.00. The Australian currency was placed in a safe.  
      
       
     35 Marek Rybar gave evidence that the customer George had $60,000.00 in Australian currency when he first dealt with him. When he spoke to Narayanan about the Cash Transaction Form, he was told it had already been arranged.  
      
       
     36 The final witness called by the Crown was Richard Power, who gave evidence identifying the type of form used by cash dealers to report to AUSTRAC. He also gave evidence that AUSTRAC had not received any significant cash transaction reports under the Act in relation to the transactions referred to in the counts contained in the indictment.  
      
       
        
       THE APPELLANTS’ CASE 
       
     37 Narayanan gave evidence in which he stated that all staff of SEF were aware of the requirement to report to AUSTRAC cash transactions involving $10,000.00 or more, and that they had received relevant training. A document containing SEF’s routine guidelines and procedures was tendered: it stated that all AUSTRAC requirements in regard to reporting were followed. Narayanan gave evidence contradicting the evidence of Ms. Malik, in particular in relation to the transactions conducted with Tony. His evidence was that he had told her not to deal with Tony as he was suspicious of him. He also gave evidence of complaints concerning Ms. Malik’s conduct whilst working for SEF.  
      
       
     38 In relation to specific evidence given concerning counts 57 and 58, Narayanan gave evidence that the transaction concerned had been on behalf of six or seven people, and that it was for a group of people staying in a hotel with which he had some connection. He said he had no dispute with the evidence of the two witnesses who gave specific evidence in relation to those counts.  
      
       
     39 The appellants called evidence that Narayanan was a person of good character, that he had been involved in the business of foreign exchange for ten years, and that neither he nor the company had any criminal conviction.

     40 Both appellants relied on the same grounds of appeal. In relation to conviction, there were four grounds, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The trial judge erred in holding that there was a case to answer on counts 39, 40, 51, 52, 53 and 54. 
          
         2. The verdicts on counts 39, 40, 51, 52, 53 and 54 cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
          
         3. His Honour erred in his directions as to what constituted a cash transaction for the purposes of s.31 of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988. 
          
         4. The trial judge failed to warn the Jury adequately in relation to the evidence of Ms Malik. 
         
        
       
     41 As regards sentence, there were two grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
          
         2. Should the appeal be upheld on counts 39, 40, 51, 52, 53 and 54 then the Court should resentence on counts 57 and 58. 
         
        
        
       SECTION 31 COUNTS 
       
     42 The first three grounds in the conviction appeal focus on the question whether the conduct of the appellants involving inter alia the recording of what would be a significant cash transaction as a number of transactions of less than $10,000.00 could be an offence against s.31 of the FTR Act.  
      
       
     43 The trial judge rejected a no-case submission that was made at the trial. His direction to the jury included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         A cash transaction does not begin and end with a customer handing over a quantity of cash to SEF. For the present purposes the transaction includes SEF dealing with the currency and entering it in its records. Thus if you find that SEF entered up its books what in reality was one transaction, as a number of smaller transactions, each under AU$10,000, then SEF would be party to a number of transactions each under AU$10,000. 
         
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     44 Mr. Game SC for the appellants submitted that, for an offence to be made out under s.31(1) of the Act, a person must be a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions, that is, transactions “involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another”. The Crown case showed that there was, in relation to the counts alleging offences under s.31(1), only one transaction involving cash which was not a non-reportable transaction, but in fact a significant cash transaction. The Crown case was that there was one transaction which was made to look like more than one.  
      
       
     45 Mr. Game submitted that, dealing with counts 51 and 52, the evidence was that Tony handed over a large quantity of cash and was provided with a quantity of travellers cheques: once that transaction occurred, whatever SEF did in relation to the recording of the transaction on the computer and producing several receipts could not change one transaction into several transactions. 
      
       
     46 Mr. Game referred to the judgment of Doyle CJ in Question of Law Reserved (No.2) of 1998 (1998) 70 SASR 502 at 505, where his Honour, in contrasting the reporting requirements of s.28 with s.31(1), noted: 
      
       
        
         
         If the Act imposed no controls upon a person engaging in a cash transaction, it would be relatively easy to obey the operation of the Act. All that one would have to do would be split a transaction up into a number of transactions involving the physical transfer of currency less than $10,000 in value. It is no doubt to deal with such evasion that Parliament enacted s.31, which is the provision in question in this case.  
         
        
        
       To similar effect is the Explanatory Memorandum issued in relation to the Cash Transaction Reports Bill 1987 (which subsequently became the FTR Act). 
        
       
     47 Mr. Game also referred to Leask v. The Commonwealth (1996) 187 CLR 579 at 591, 620-21, 637; R v. Leask [1999] NSWCCA 33; and R v. Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503. 
      
       
     48 In so far as there was any residual doubt in the effect of the section, that should be resolved in favour of the appellant: Beckwith v. The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576. 
      
       
     49 Mr. Roberts SC for the Crown submitted that, in relation to transactions involving the receipt of cash by SEF from a customer, the cash transaction does not begin and end with the customer handing over a quantity of cash. Each transaction is a process involving inter alia SEF dealing with the currency to reflect what is intended by the party or parties involved to be the manner or form of the transaction. In relation to counts 39, 40, 51, 52, 53 and 54, SEF and Narayanan, in dealing with the currency, transformed what otherwise would have been one transaction into a number of smaller transactions, for the purpose of attempting to ensure that the currency was transferred in a manner or form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. 
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     50 One element of the offences charged under s.31(1) is that SEF must have been “party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions”, that is, so far as relevant, cash transactions not “involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000”. In relation to counts 51 and 52, this required that the events of 6 September 1999 amounted to SEF being a party to five cash transactions each involving the transfer of currency of less than $10,000.00.  
      
       
     51 The evidence showed that Tony filled in forms relating to the issue of American Express travellers cheques to the face value of US$3,500.00 in the name of Patrick Hoffman, US$6,000.00 in the name of Albert Rafter; US$6,000.00 in the name of George Davis; US$6,000.00 in the name of John Adams; and US$5,000.00 in the name of Tony Collins; and handed over an amount which, together with the $14,000.00 previously handed over, made up a total of $43,600.00 in return for these cheques; and that subsequently SEF recorded these events in its computer as five transactions involving those amounts in US dollar travellers cheques, with five slightly different exchange rates, and amounts in Australian dollars in respect of each transaction appropriate to the amount of the travellers cheques and the exchange rate for that transaction.  
      
       
     52 It is true that, as submitted by Mr. Game, those circumstances may, considered as a whole, mean that SEF was party to a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000.00. But in my opinion, that does not necessarily mean that those circumstances do not also mean that SEF was also party to five cash transactions each involving the transfer of currency of less than $10,000.00. This may be illustrated by considering two scenarios.  
      
       
     53 First, suppose that A, B and C each give D $9,000.00; and then A, B, C and D go together to a cash dealer. D hands over $36,000.00, and each of A, B, C and D fill out forms for travellers cheques representing A$9,000.00. The cash dealer issues travellers cheques in those four names, and records the events as four separate transactions, one each with A, B, C and D. In those circumstances, it seems to me that there are simply four non-reportable transactions, each involving the physical transfer of $9,000.00, not withstanding that the money was handed over in one lot of $36,000.00. I do not think those events could be characterised as being a single transaction: that characterisation would not be true as a matter of substance.  
      
       
     54 Secondly, suppose that D goes alone to the cash dealer, hands over $36,000.00, and fills out forms for travellers cheques in the names of A, B, C and D where A, B and C are fictitious. Travellers cheques equivalent o $9,000.00 are issued in each of the four names, and the events are recorded as four separate transactions in the books of the cash dealer. In my opinion, these events can be regarded as amounting both to one significant cash transaction, and also as four transactions, none of which is a significant cash transaction. Although the same parties are involved in all four transactions, and only one sum of money is handed over, the parties to the transaction by their conduct manifested an intention that there be four transactions. In those circumstances, in my opinion a characterisation of the events as one transaction is true as a matter of substance, and characterisation of the events as four transactions is also true as a matter of substance; and these two characterisations are not inconsistent.  
      
       
     55 In my opinion, the terms of s.31(1) confirm this view. They refer to a person being a party to two or more non-reportable transactions for the purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the currency was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. The specific reference to “attempting to ensure” shows that the provision contemplates that the conducting of transactions as two or more non-reportable transactions may not be successful in ensuring that they do not also constitute a significant cash transaction. 
      
       
     56 Turning to the events of 6 September, in my opinion there was a transaction whereby Tony obtained a number of travellers cheques in return for a physical transfer of currency of $43,600.00. In my opinion, there was also a transaction whereby Tony obtained travellers cheques for US$3,500.00 in the name of Patrick Hoffman, in return for the physical transfer of cash, namely so much of the $43,600.00 as was or would be allocated to that transaction, that is, $5,756.00. That transaction did not involve the transfer of $10,000.00 or more, because the remainder of the $43,600.00 did not concern this transaction.  
      
       
     57 The same analysis would apply to each parcel of travellers cheques issued in the different names. The analysis is appropriate, in my opinion, because that is what both parties, as shown by their actions, intended at the time of their dealing with each other. But if $43,600.00 had been handed over with no parts allocated to different transactions, there would have been no transaction other than a transaction involving the transfer of a sum of $10,000.00 or more. 
      
       
     58 On that analysis, the direction given by the trial judge was erroneous. It was not correct to say, as the trial judge said to the jury, that if SEF entered up in its books what in reality was one transaction as a number of smaller transactions, each under $10,000.00, then SEF would be a party to a number of transactions, each under $10,000.00. Rather, the jury should have been directed that it was necessary for them to find beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time when Tony and SEF were dealing with each other, their intention as shown by their actions was that there be a number of separate transactions and that there be allocated to each of these separate transactions a part of the total money transferred, that part being less than $10,000.00.  
      
       
     59 In order to find the appellants guilty on these counts, the jury must have accepted Ms. Malik’s evidence and rejected that of Mr. Narayanan. It could be said that, in those circumstances, a finding as to the relevant intention was inevitable. However, the misdirection concerned a point which was well and truly taken at the trial, and it did concern an essential element of the offence with which the appellants were charged. I do not think the direction can be treated as immaterial; so that if the appeal is to be dismissed, it can only be by application of the proviso. I will consider that matter when I have considered the other grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
       WARNING CONCERNING MS. MALIK 
       
     60 The fourth ground of appeal against conviction raises a question under s.165 of the Evidence Act, which is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         165(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
          
         (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,  
          
         (b) identification evidence,  
          
         (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,  
          
         (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,  
          
         (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,  
          
         (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,  
          
         (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person---evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.  
          
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
          
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
          
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
          
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
          
         (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.  
          
         (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.  
          
         (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.  
         
        
       
     61 The trial judge gave a warning concerning her evidence, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         The Evidence Act requires me to give you a warning that the evidence of Ms. Malik may be unreliable. The reason for this is that she could be in the position of an accomplice in relation to the allegations of structuring and has been given an indemnity, which you will have with you, by the DPP, Director of Public Prosecutions, against prosecution for the evidence she gave in this court. Accordingly I am required to warn you that there is a need for caution in determining whether to accept her evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
         
        
       
     62 Counsel for the accused sought a more extensive warning, making the following submission: 
      
       
        
         
         Your Honour, the application is that in addition to what your Honour’s said your Honour tell the jury that it has been found from experience that there are certain classes of witnesses whose evidence is inherently suspect. Accomplices are one such class because they are not impartial witnesses and further your Honour that the rationale for the warning is that the witness’ involvement in the crime in issue may incline them to falsely implicate another person, either with a view to exculpating themselves or with a view to minimising their own role, or perhaps with a view to currying their own favour with the police and that it may incline them to promote their own cause when giving evidence. 
         
        
        
       The trial judge declined to give any further direction on this matter. 
        
       
     63 Mr. Game submitted that the warning given was inadequate. It did not give the reasons why Ms. Malik’s evidence may have been unreliable, and did not explain either the effect of the indemnity or how that might impact on the manner in which she gave evidence. Mr. Game referred to R v. Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 at 306, 309 and 329.  
      
       
     64 Mr. Game submitted that Ms. Malik’s evidence was not relevant simply to the specific accounts about which she gave evidence: the evidence of practice was relevant to all counts, and her evidence was relevant to the credit of Narayanan. Narayanan gave evidence directly contradicting her evidence. Accordingly, Mr. Game submitted, the failure to give a proper warning was of central importance and the conviction on all counts should be quashed.  
      
       
     65 Mr. Roberts submitted that it was not necessary that any particular form of words should be used: s.165(4). Furthermore, the form of the warning will often depend on what has occurred at the trial and what is in issue. Ms. Malik was cross-examined to suggest that she had been charged with offences relating to the subject events, and that, if those charged against her were dropped and she obtained an indemnity, this would have assisted her in obtaining permanent residence in Australia. The jury were accordingly aware of possible motivations for Ms. Malik not to give true evidence, and the warning was sufficient in the circumstances.  
      
       
     66 Mr. Roberts also pointed to submissions which occurred prior to the summing up, when the question of a direction under s.165 of the Evidence Act was discussed. When discussing the s.165 direction to be given, Counsel for the appellants submitted that “our case is that she is not telling the truth about the essential matters concerning structuring and she is doing it to protect herself, as was put to her, and she has got the indemnity”. The Crown submitted in response that, if such a direction was given, the trial judge should change his ruling in relation to the admission into evidence of a statement made by Ms. Malik on 28 September, said to have been made before any question of indemnity arose. It had been previously submitted that the cross-examination of Ms. Malik raised a suggestion of recent invention, making that statement admissible; but the statement at that stage had been rejected by the trial judge. Following further discussion, the trial judge indicated that he proposed to warn the jury that her evidence may be unreliable and that it could be so because she could be in the position of an accomplice in relation to the structuring and was given an indemnity by the DPP. To that statement, Counsel for the appellant responded “If that is as far as your Honour wants to go so be it. I say your Honour should go further …”.  
      
       
     67 Mr. Roberts submitted that the fact that the wording of the warning sought was not as requested reflected a forensic choice by the appellants’ Counsel that the additional words would have been neutralised by the admission into evidence of Ms. Malik’s prior consistent statement. 
      
       
     68 In my opinion, there is no force in the lastmentioned submission of the Crown. The appellants’ Counsel did not at the trial concede that, if the statement was not admitted into evidence, it was appropriate for the trial judge to give no greater warning than he in fact gave. There was no relevant forensic decision taken by the appellants’ Counsel. 
      
       
     69 In R v. Stewart, at 329, Howie J said this: 
      
       
        
         
         In respect of accomplices or persons otherwise implicated in the offence before the jury, the matters which were considered by the common law as rendering their evidence suspect and which gave rise to the need for a warning were two-fold: firstly, they may have a reason to implicate another person even to the extent of implicating a person who is in fact innocent of the crime and, secondly, they may tend to exaggerate the role of another while minimising their own involvement and fabricate evidence to achieve this end: R v McLachlan [1999] 2 VR 553 at 562; R v Kendrick [1997] 2 VR 699 at 705; Downey (1997) 97 A Crim R 41 at 44; Ware (1994) 73 A Crim R 17 at 28.  
          
          
         As the trial judge in the present case told the jury, these are the matters within the special experience of the courts. Therefore, they are matters which should be drawn to the attention of the jury whenever a warning under the section is given in respect of evidence of a witness falling within this category. These are the matters about which the trial judge is required to inform the jury under s 165(2)(b) unless there is good reason not to do so. In Wood v R [2001] NSWCCA 228 it was argued on behalf of the applicant that the trial judge should have informed the jury that ""persons involved in the commission of an offence may make false claims as to the involvement of others out of motives of revenge or antipathy"". This Court held that there was no requirement for the trial judge to inform the jury of such a matter because it would have been obvious to them. However, it should be noted that at the trial no request had been made for a warning under s 165(2). 
         
        
        
       It would appear that Spigelman CJ and Hulme J concurred in this aspect of Howie J’s reasons. 
        
       
     70 In my opinion, the direction given in this case did not satisfy the requirement of s.165(2)(b) that the judge inform the jury of matters that may cause the evidence to be unreliable. I do not think it was adequate merely to point out that Ms. Malik “could be in the position of an accomplice”.  
      
       
     71 The point was adequately taken at the trial, and I do not think it can be said that the deficiency is immaterial. So in relation to this matter also, it will be necessary to consider the effect of the proviso. 
      
       
        
       PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE OF MR. SHETTAR 
       
     72 The appellants applied to add an additional ground of appeal, namely that the trial miscarried by reason of prejudicial evidence given by Mr. Shettar. 
      
       
     73 The evidence in question was given by Mr. Shettar in the following exchange: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Subject to his Honour's ruling would you answer my question? Were you told you were incompetent or not very good at the job? 
          
         A. No sir, I quit myself as per my wife instruction. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Beg your pardon?  
          
         A. As per my wife instruction I quit the job. 
          
          
         Q. ""I quit the job myself"", what was that about your wife? 
          
         A. She works in Tax Department. She works in Taxation Department, and I used to tell her what is happening everyday here. [STRIKEOUT BEGINS] and she told me one day ""better you quit the job, otherwise you be in trouble"". [STRIKEOUT ENDS] Straight away- 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I don't know that you can have that. That last bit about that answer about what his wife told him would be struck out. 
         
        
       
     74 That exchange led to an immediate application for discharge of the jury, to which the trial judge did not accede. However, the trial judge did give directions to the jury in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Thankyou members of the jury. There is one matter I would like to say to you. Shortly before lunch Mr Prakash Shettar whilst giving evidence gave an explanation that his wife said something to him before he left his job with the company and you may remember that I ruled that that evidence was inadmissible. You should disregard it. It will not form part of the transcript in the case. The accused is not charged with anything apart from the charges which you have in the indictment before you. Thankyou. 
         
        
       
     75 Mr. Game submitted that the directions in the circumstance could not suffice, and that the prejudice was such that the trial miscarried: Maric v. R (1978) 52 ALJR 631.  
      
       
     76 In my opinion, as submitted by Mr. Roberts, the correct reading of the transcript is that the question that gave rise to the allegedly prejudicial material was a question asked by the appellants’ Counsel, not by the trial judge. However, even if the question had been one asked by the trial judge, I do not think that the material is of such a prejudicial nature as could have justified a discharge of the jury. The material could not possibly have caused a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
       PROVISO 
       
     77 I have found two errors in the trial judge’s summing up, which cannot be dismissed as immaterial. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed unless the Crown satisfies the Court that there has been no miscarriage of justice, that is, that the appellant has not lost a reasonable possibility of acquittal.  
      
       
     78 I consider first the misdirection concerning the requirements for a s.31(1) offence. In relation to counts 51 and 52, in my opinion the misdirection could not conceivably have made a difference. There was undisputed and overwhelming evidence that both Tony and SEF intended that there be five parcels of travellers cheques, in different names, for each of which an appropriate part of the totality paid was to be attributed, and thus that there should be five non-reportable transactions (with a view if possible to avoiding there being one significant transaction). The knowing participation of Narayanan in this intention and transaction depended on precisely the same evidence as his knowing participation in the writing up of the transactions. Similar comments apply to counts 53 and 54.  
      
       
     79 As regards counts 39 and 40, the position is not so clear. A reasonable inference was available that George requested that the dealing be treated by SEF as seven transactions, each below $10,000.00; but the evidence was that US$40,000.00 in cash was handed over in exchange for a total of $64,400.00, and the only evidence that there were seven transactions in fact were the subsequent computer entries. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that a correct direction may not reasonably have led to a different verdict. 
      
       
     80 As regards the direction concerning Ms. Malik, the shortcoming in the direction was not great, in all the circumstances. Ms. Malik had been cross-examined as to her motive to lie, to the extent chosen by the appellants’ Counsel. The authority of the judge was given to the proposition that her evidence should be treated with caution, as it could be unreliable. Reasons for that had already been explored in cross-examination, so that the jury would not be unaware of the reasons. Furthermore, quite apart from her evidence, the Crown case was strong.  
      
       
     81 Narayanan gave incredible evidence concerning the George transaction, participation in which he conceded. He claimed that he understood that $64,000.00 was being exchanged on behalf of seven people, yet there was no record of the names of these seven people or of their allegedly separate transactions, apart from a computer record which gave patently false information (as to individual amounts tendered, change given, and different exchange rates) for which Narayanan had no explanation.  
      
       
     82 Narayanan’s evidence that he told Ms. Malik not to deal with Tony was inconsistent with recorded telephone conversations between Narayanan and Tony. There was inherent improbability that Ms. Malik would, contrary to Narayanan’s direction, deal with Tony on her own initiative and set up a record of the same kind as was set up in relation to the George transaction, in which Narayanan admittedly participated. 
      
       
     83 I am not satisfied that the appellants did not lose a reasonable possibility of an acquittal in relation to counts 39 and 40. Otherwise I am so satisfied, and I would apply the proviso and dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       SENTENCE 
       
     84 The maximum penalty by way of imprisonment that may be imposed under s.28 is two years, and the maximum under s.31 is five years. In passing sentence, the trial judge noted evidence that Narayanan was a person of exemplary character. He noted the submission of the Crown that the offences would be viewed as proved instances of ongoing conduct engaged in by a cash dealer, at the direction of Narayanan; and were clearly not isolated instances of such conduct. The trial judge said that he took those submissions into account, and he noted the provisions of s.17A of the Crimes Act, that the Court should not pass sentence of imprisonment unless the Court, having regard to all the available sentences, was satisfied that no other sentence was appropriate in the circumstances. He noted the submission of Counsel for the appellants that the three transactions were proved as isolated instances of conduct and were not evidence of ongoing conduct. He went on to remark that he did not take into account matters on which the appellant was found not guilty, or conduct which did not form part of the offence for which the appellants were to be sentenced. His Honour concluded that, having considered all other sentencing options, that a custodial sentence was appropriate in relation to the appellant Narayanan.  
      
       
     85 Mr. Game submitted that there was no reasoning as to why no other sentence apart from imprisonment was appropriate. He further submitted that the appellants did stand to be sentenced on the basis that the offences were two isolated instances. 
      
       
     86 In my opinion, no error is disclosed in the reasoning of the trial judge concerning sentence, or in the result. His Honour set out at length all the factors that he took into account, including general deterrence, and set out the other sentencing options; and in my opinion, those reasons did support the trial judge’s conclusion that no other sentence apart from imprisonment was appropriate in the case of Narayanan.  
      
       
     87 I accept it would have been an error for the trial judge to pass sentence on the basis that the appellants were guilty of any other conduct apart from the conduct of which they were found guilty. However, in assessing the culpability of that conduct, his Honour was entitled to conclude and proceed on the basis that the conduct in question was not conduct which was wholly contrary to the way in which the appellants carried on business, and in that sense, did not constitute isolated “out-of-character” events.  
      
       
     88 However, in view of my decision in relation to conviction, it is necessary to re-consider the sentence. On that question, in addition to all the subjective matters referred to by the trial judge, there has been tendered in evidence a letter from Dr. R.S. Muthukrishnan giving a medical report on Mr. Narayanan, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         At your request I examined Mr Narayanan today and the following is my medical report: 
          
          
         Mr Narayanan presented himself extremely depressed, melancholic and anxious. He complained of insomnia, panic attacks, loss of appetite, poor motivation and total lack of energy. He told me about the custodial sentencing, being on bail and the consequent social humiliation and suffering. He also told me about the unaccustomed circumstances he had to bear during his period of custody - the passive smoking, the unavailability of vegetarian food and the grouping together of various offenders. 
          
          
         Mr Narayanan also mentioned his travel restrictions and regretted deeply his inability to see his 90-year-old and ailing father. His elder daughter's arranged marriage also is in jeopardy, partly because of his inability to go to India to organise formalities and partly because the social stigma of his jail sentence. Unable to face the local Indian community in Sydney, Mr Narayanan has been living like a recluse. His younger daughter who is in year 12, who is struggling to concentrate on her studies, his wife a very orthodox traditional Indian woman trying to cover up the humiliation - are all showing signs of reactive depression. These domestic and social circumstances make Mr Narayanan's already fragile self-image crumble. 
          
          
         On examination, his BP was very high at 160/100. He was deeply depressed showing signs of emotional exhaustion almost on the verge of a psychological crisis. 
          
          
         He was too depressed to accept my hypnotherapy session today. He also told me that he had not been taking the medications --- Prothiaden prescribed by his psychiatrist Dr Paul Friend. This is a precarious situation and in my opinion, a further custodial sentence may precipitate a major psychosis. 
         
        
       
     89 In my opinion, the offences for which the appellants were convicted are very serious offences. The objective of monitoring large cash transactions, so as to combat money laundering and tax evasion, are important objectives; and it is vital that cash dealers comply with the requirements of the FTR Act. It is extremely difficult to detect breaches, so the element of general deterrence is extremely important. 
      
       
     90 On the whole, I think the sentences imposed by the trial judge are appropriate in relation to the counts in respect of which the convictions stand, substantially for the reasons he gave. 
      
       
        
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     91 In the result, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
      
       
       1. Appeal against conviction on counts 39 and 40 allowed, and those convictions quashed. 
        
       2. Otherwise, appeal against convictions dismissed.  
        
       3. Leave to appeal against sentences in respect of counts 51-54 and 57 and 58 granted, but appeals dismissed. 
        
       
     92 BARR J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     93 GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA, and with the reasons he has given.

       “38(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
       
     (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or … 
      
       
        
         
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
         
        
       
     Section 192 relevantly provided: 
      
       
       “192… 
        
       (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
        
       … 
       
     (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and(d) the nature of the proceeding; and (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.”The appellant was charged with supply of a prohibited drug, heroin, contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) ss 25(1) and 29. Evidence given by the appellant’s girlfriend in a recorded interview was inconsistent with evidence given by her at trial. The Crown applied for and was granted leave to cross-examine the witness pursuant to Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 38. No reference was made by counsel or the trial judge to the matters relevant to a grant of leave under Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 192. The appellant appealed against conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence, relevantly arguing that: (1) the trial judge erred in his grant of leave pursuant to s 38; (2) the trial judge erred in permitting questions to be asked beyond the scope of the leave granted; and (3) the trial miscarried because the prejudicial value of the evidence thereby adduced outweighed its probative value.Held, (Heydon JA, Dunford and Buddin JJ agreeing), dismissing the appeal,(1) Because the capacity of a party to question a witness under s 38 “as though the party were cross-examining” depended on the grant of leave, there was a mandatory duty on the trial judge to consider the matters relevant to a grant of leave set out in s 192(2). This the trial judge did not do. The grant of leave was vitiated by error of law: [37], [47].

       Stanoevski v R

     (2) Notwithstanding the trial judge’s error, had ss 135, 137 and 192 properly been considered, a grant of leave pursuant to s 38 could have been properly made in this case. None of the factors in s 192(2)(a)-(e) pointed against the grant of leave, and it had not been demonstrated that the evidence in question had prejudicial value which outweighed its probative value: [50]-[52], [90].(3) Questioning of unfavourable witnesses “about” the matters in s 38(1) was not confined narrowly to those matters. Leave to question “as though the party were cross-examining” would properly be granted where questioning was not narrowly confined to one of the matters in s 38(1), but also to establishing the probability of the factual state of affairs in relation to those subjects contended for by the party conducting the questioning or the improbability of the witness’s evidence on those subjects. To establish a state of affairs a questioner would be entitled to ask questions going solely to credibility on s 38(1) subjects: [55], [67], [90].

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: On 7 March 2001, after a five day trial at Newcastle before Coolahan DCJ and a jury, the appellant was convicted on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 18 July 1997 at Port Macquarie. On 9 April 2001 he was sentenced to imprisonment for three and a half years to commence on 7 March 2001. A non-parole period of two years was fixed. The appeal is against conviction and the appellant also seeks leave to appeal on sentence.  
      
       
        
       Background 
        
       
     2 The trial judge said the following in his remarks on sentence. 
      
       
        
         
         “The facts in relation to the matter as obviously accepted by the jury disclose that on 18 July 1997, pursuant to a search warrant, police attended at the offender’s townhouse in Port Macquarie. The search warrant was obtained in the course of a major drug operation in the Port Macquarie Area. At 6.45am on that date, they entered into the offender’s unit and broke into his bedroom where the offender was standing in the middle of the room. His then girlfriend, Amber O’Brien, was in bed. The warrant was explained to him and he was allowed to dress, his clothes being checked out by police prior to him putting them on. He was then taken downstairs where the occupier’s notice was read to him. 
         
        
        
         
         Shortly after that he was taken back up the stairs for the purpose of the police conducting a search. The offender was in front Detective Richards was behind him and behind Detective Richards was Detective Sainsbury who had been video recording events at the flat, and in particular the search. Both Detective Richards and Detective Sainsbury gave evidence, which was obviously accepted by the jury, that when he was several steps from the top of the stairs the offender ran up the stairs and into the toilet which was just near the top of the stairs. Police then heard the toilet flush. They ran after the offender and took hold of him in the vicinity of the toilet. There was no one else upstairs at the time. The police checked the toilet bowl but could only see water and froth apparently caused by a toilet cleaner of some sort. 
         
        
        
         
         Some time later other police again looked at the toilet and this time, amongst the froth, saw two plastic packets floating in the bowl. One plastic packet was wound into a ball and was covered in elastic bands. The parcel was subsequently weighed and analysed and found to be thirteen point six grams of powder containing heroin of a purity of seventy-nine per cent. The other item was a plastic bag containing two resealable plastic bags which again were weighed and analysed and found to contain white powder, one containing point five of a gram and the other point six-one of a gram, both containing heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         At no time did the police see the offender in possession of any drugs and at no time did they see him put them in the toilet. 
         
        
        
         
         The police case was that, in accordance with the current practice, the drugs were kept in the toilet so that they might easily be disposed of in the event that the place was raided.  
         
        
        
         
         Based on the actions of the offender in flushing the toilet he was arrested and conveyed to the police station where he participated in a record of interview. During the course of that record of interview he made full admissions as to his ownership of the drug. He was then charged with this offence. 
         
        
        
         
         At trial, evidence was given along the lines that I have described. In addition, the Crown called Ms Amber O’Brien. She said that the drugs in question were hers and not the offender’s despite the fact that in an earlier statement to the police she had said that they had belonged to the offender. Leave was granted to cross-examine her on the basis of the prior inconsistent statement. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender also gave evidence at trial. He denied running to the toilet and said that he was not sure whether he had flushed the toilet or not. He denied that the heroin was his and said that he had never seen it before. 
         
        
        
         
         As to the record of interview, he did not dispute that the interview was accurately recorded but said that he made the admissions contained therein because of threats made to him by police in the police vehicle on his way to the police station. He said, in effect, that he was told that if he did not admit that the heroin was his both he and his girlfriend, Amber O’Brien, would be charged and they would not be granted bail. It was on this basis, he said, that he had made the admissions. 
         
        
        
         
         There were three police officers in the car at the relevant time and each denied that this threat was ever made. 
         
        
        
         
         Clearly the jury rejected the offender’s evidence and regarded the admissions made by him in the record of interview as being true. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, there was discovered at the unit items which might be regarded as being indicia of actual supply. These included resealable plastic bags similar to the ones found in the toilet and a sensitive set of scales. Although explanations were given as to the use that was being made of these items I have no doubt that their use, at least in part, related to the supply of heroin.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     3 The quantity of the drug was 14.71 grams. The conviction was based not on actual supply of the drug but on its deemed supply by reason of the quantity allegedly in the appellant’s possession. At the time of the events in issue, Amber O’Brien was aged 17. The appellant was then aged 19. She was cohabitating with the appellant, though by the time of the trial she had ceased to do so and the appellant had married another woman.  
      
       
        
        
       The grounds of appeal relating to conviction 
        
       
     4 Ground 1 was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred by granting leave pursuant to Section 38 of the Evidence Act to the Crown Prosecutor to cross examine Amber O’Brien.” 
         
        
        
       Ground 2 was as follows: 
        
        
         
         “The trial miscarried because the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant flowing from the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination of Amber O’Brien outweighed the probative value of that evidence.” 
         
        
        
       Ground 3 was as follows: 
        
        
         
         “The trial miscarried because of the admission of evidence relating to the registration of a motor vehicle in Amber O’Brien’s name.” 
         
        
        
       The s 38 application 
        
       
     5 On the third day Amber O’Brien began to give evidence in chief after having been called by the Crown. After some minutes of evidence, the Crown made an application under s 38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995. It was opposed. Section 38 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
          
          
         (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 
         
        
        
         
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39). 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness’s credibility. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs.  
         
        
        
         
         (5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs. 
         
        
        
         
         (6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
         
        
        
         
         (7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person; and  
         
        
        
         
         (b) the party is a witness in the proceeding.” 
         
        
       
     6 The terms of ss 135, 137 and 192 are also relevant.  
      
       
        
         
         “135. The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
          
          
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) be misleading or confusing; or 
         
        
        
         
         (c) cause or result in undue waste of time. 
         
        
        
         
         137. In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
         
        
        
         
         192. (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 
         
        
        
         
         (d) the nature of the proceeding; and 
         
        
        
         
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
         
        
        
       The arguments of Crown counsel on the s 38 application 
        
       
     7 Crown counsel commenced the application by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “My application is in respect of section 38(1)(c) that the witness has made a prior statement inconsistent with her in-court testimony and I would be seeking to cross-examine her in relation to matters that are contained in her evidence. Her evidence your Honour on – the ERISP I should say indicates 17 July but it was indeed Friday 18 July [1997], the same day of the search, ERISP, and the interview commenced at 11.49 and if I could hand up a copy of that interview.  
         
        
        
         
         EXHIBIT #A ON APPLICATION TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour commencing at question 47 the witness in the interview was asked ‘Who made the bongs?’ and the answer was ‘Ian’. I haven’t asked her directly that question but proceeding to question 64 and following through to question 136 refers to the questions in relation to the heroin. Question 64 ‘Heroin was found in the toilet bowl?’ it says ‘Yes’. The following question 65 in relation to the search she says, ‘Can you tell me about that?’ she said ‘I’m not sure, I was downstairs’. It goes on ‘Have you seen them before?’, ‘Yes in Ian’s possession, he used it in a bong, used two or three grams’. Question 78 ‘And who would supply you with two grams?’ answer ‘Ian’. Question 79 ‘Would you buy it from him or was it given to you?’ answer ‘Given’. ‘How often has he given you it?’, ‘Every day’ is the answer. Question 83 ‘How much?’, ‘Half a gram’. Question 84 ‘How was that administered each time?’, ‘Through a bong’. Question 84 ‘You said that you have it daily, how long ago did he first start supplying it to you daily?’ answer ‘Approximately two weeks ago’. 
         
        
        
         
         Question 88 ‘Have you used it every day since then?’ answer ‘Yes’. Question 94 ‘What do you believe the white powder to be?’ answer ‘Heroin’. ‘Who did you ask?’ meaning question 101, ‘Who did you ask in relation to the heroin?’ answer ‘Ian’. His evidence as to – question 107 using it by means of a snow cone. Question 117, in relation to the two packets seen prior the answer is ‘Yes’. Question 118 ‘Where?’ answer ‘In the bedroom’. Question 119 ‘Whereabouts?’, ‘Ian had them’, answer. Question 127 ‘Was Ian handling them?’ answer ‘Yes’. Question 126 ‘Whereabouts in the bedroom?’, ‘Ian had them on him’. Question 127 ‘When you say on him was it in his pocket?’ answer ‘Down his undies’. Question 128 ‘Down his underpants was it?’ answer ‘Yes’. Question 130 ‘Can you tell me why you believed he would have it down his underwear?’ answer ‘Cause that’s where he had it at that time’. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour at questions commencing at 320 she’s asked in relation to the plastic bags and she proffers a story about horse samples and the use of plastic bags for the horse supplements. In relation to the scales commencing at 410 she says that she used to make up horse samples with them and the plastic bags.” 
         
        
       
     8 Counsel’s point was that in the record of interview of 18 July 1997, the witness had said that the appellant had sold her heroin every day for two weeks and used heroin himself. She also said that he concealed heroin in his underwear. Yet in chief she said the appellant had not used heroin for six months, that she had never obtained heroin from him, that she had never seen him with heroin in his underwear, and that she could not recall telling the police that she had.

         EXHIIBIT #C ON APPLICATION TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         COLES: Thank you your Honour. That’s the statements I intend to tender on the application. Does your Honour wish to hear from me now? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         COLES: Your Honour the Crown submits that the witness has made a number of statements that demonstrate a clear inconsistency with the evidence contained in the electronically recorded interview on 18 July 1997 and that evidence is the statement she’s made on 18 November 2000 and the record of interview she had with Detective Richards on 20 November. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour it’s the Crown’s submission that the inconsistency is clear in accordance with section 38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act and that the Crown would then seek leave to cross-examine the witness in relation to those statements. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In relation to those inconsistencies only? 
         
        
        
         
         COLES: Yes your Honour, in relation to the inconsistencies, which are considerable. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Oh yes. 
         
        
        
         
         COLES: Your Honour perhaps if I extend that to, if I could make this observation. The witness gave evidence in relation to proceedings at the Port Macquarie District Court in May 1999 in relation to a voir dire. Your Honour I would be asking to question her, to cross-examine her, as to the fact that she sat a number of feet from the Judge, from Crown Prosecutors, from Court Officers, and at no stage did she indicate that the wrong person was in the dock, that she was the owner of the said drugs and that there was considerable waste of time and public money pursuing a matter that she was going to admit to.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The arguments of defence counsel on the s 38 application 
        
       
     10 Counsel for the appellant was then called on, and submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well the section requires your Honour has to give leave if— 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes— 
         
        
        
         
         McCOLM: -- if it’s to be done. My friend says that he’s set out the ground for 38(1)(c). Your Honour my view is, and I might stand corrected, is that 38(1)(c) doesn’t specify the grounds that your Honour is to consider as to whether your Honour would give leave. What 38(1) specifies what areas a person may be cross-examined about, if your Honour does in fact give leave. In fact the section is not – an Act doesn’t specify when a person is to be regarded as unfavourable. It specifies, 38(1) specifies what cross-examination may be about but doesn’t otherwise give your Honour assistance. 38(6) does raise matters that your Honour may take into account but obviously that is not exhaustive. Those matters of a party giving notice at the earliest opportunity and 38(1)(b) is another matter. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour clearly in this case she has given, in respect of some particular matters, different accounts about the heroin and it’s a matter whether your Honour sees that sufficient to give leave for the Crown to cross-examine about those matters. If your Honour was so minded to do that, and I won’t say anything further than that, your Honour my submission is that it would not extend to giving leave to cross-examine about the evidence, or her failure to indicate something at a previous trial. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Honour what this person has come forward has come forward with information which incriminates herself. Now clearly a person is under no obligation at all to come forward and incriminate themselves. There is no evidence that she was approached by any prosecution witness, police officer or officer of a prosecution office at the committal to ask about her evidence. She was called in respect of a particular matter at that trial before his Honour Judge Luland, and that being details as to her arrest and the accused’s arrest. 
         
        
        
         
         If your Honour is minded to grant leave I suggest that it’s not general leave for cross-examination it should be restricted to where she has made a prior inconsistent statement. That’s all I’d wish to say your Honour.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11 These submissions could not be described as vigorously opposing any grant of leave about “different accounts”, ie to the police, but they did not consent to it. The submissions much more strongly opposed any leave beyond leave in relation to prior inconsistent statements to the police, such as leave in relation to proceedings before Luland DCJ.  
      
       
        
       The trial judge’s reasons for judgment on the s 38 application 
        
       
     12 The trial judge delivered judgment acceding to the application in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Section 38(1) provides that a party who calls a witness may, with leave of the court, question the witness as though the party were cross-examining the witness about certain matters. The two matters which would appear to be relevant here are sub-paragraph (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party or (c) about whether the witness has at any time made a prior inconsistent statement.  
         
        
        
         
         Dealing with the latter, there is no doubt that on 18 July 1997 during the course of an electronically recorded record of interview the witness Amber O’Brien, the subject of this application to cross-examine, made statements which are diametrically opposed to the evidence that she has given in the witness box thus far in chief today. Accordingly, I would give leave to the Crown to cross-examine her about whether she has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 
         
        
        
         
         As to sub-paragraph (a) it seems to me that the evidence given by the witness thus far, particularly when one takes into account the interview to which I have just referred, is certainly unfavourable to the Crown and I would give leave to the Crown to cross-examine her in respect of that evidence as well. The extent to which the cross-examination is allowed relates only to the evidence that she is giving and whether she has made a prior inconsistent statement. The Crown has already outlined the basis upon which he wishes to cross-examine the witness and I grant leave on that basis. 
          
          
         In granting leave I have taken into account sub-paragraph 6 which requires the court to take into account whether the party, namely the Crown, gave notice at the earliest opportunity and also the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. Leave to cross-examine is therefore granted. 
         
        
        
         
         McCOLM: Your Honour does that include leave to cross-examine about what was said on the voir dire, or not said on the voir dire, or at a trial at Port Macquarie in May ’99? That’s one thing I think my friend himself raised your Honour— 
         
        
        
         
         COLES: That’s so. I’d seek that leave your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Yes. Yes I think that falls into category (a) which seems to be a much more general provision for facility to cross-examine than paragraph (c). 
         
        
        
         
         LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Just in relation to that application, which I have granted. I should also say that so far as the proposed cross-examination of the witness is concerned, as to all matters raised by the learned Crown Advocate, I grant leave under subs 3 of s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine as to credibility only, should that be the only issue raised.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The appellant’s position in outline 
        
       
     13 In essence the appellant’s arguments were that the trial judge erred in granting leave under s 38 on a basis as wide as he did; that leave under s 38 must be granted in specific and narrow terms so as to avoid the risk of unfair prejudice to the accused; and that the actual questioning that followed the grant of leave extended beyond the grant of leave and was itself prejudicial, particularly because it concluded by suggesting that Amber O’Brien had changed her story at the instigation of the appellant and in return for the gift of a car.  
      
       
        
       The s 38 question complained of 
        
       
     14 The s 38 examination commenced with a series of five leading questions about what happened when the police arrived. The witness was then asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You didn’t tell the police at that point that it was your heroin did you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Okay. The accused was subsequently taken away and in handcuffs by two police? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you tell any of the police that remained that the heroin belonged to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were taken to the police station you had, on your version at least, some considerable time before you were interviewed, that’s right isn’t it, you were waiting in the foyer? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was probably about 15 minutes, 20 minutes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were waiting in the foyer for your mother to arrive, that’s right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yep. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You had a chance to dwell on the circumstances of the morning’s evidence at that stage didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you speak to any police officer at the front desk and tell them ‘There’s been a terrible mistake, it’s all mine’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t speak to anyone down there, no . … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now you had to wait for some hours before you yourself were interviewed that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And again you had some time to dwell on what was going on and the events that transpired that morning that had brought you into the custody of the police? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you understood at that stage that you had been arrested? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I wasn’t sure if I had been or not, not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You certainly knew that you were going to be spoken to by the police? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
        
        
       The appellant submitted that these questions went solely to credibility, did not relate to any prior inconsistent statement, and extended beyond the terms of the leave granted. 
        
       
     15 The next passage complained of by the appellant followed some questions about the police interview which were not criticised. It is: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. In May 1999 you gave evidence at Port Macquarie Court in relation to these matters didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I believe I did, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you tell the accused’s solicitor or his barrister that this heroin was yours? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t tell him it was mine but I told him that it wasn’t Ian’s, I didn’t tell him the whole, complete story. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You told the whole, complete story. Who did you tell that to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t tell the whole complete story --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t. Would you please speak up a little bit? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In that course of that proceedings you sat about the same distance as yourself to the Judge today? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t tell the Judge? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. After you gave your evidence in those proceedings did you stay around the court to give evidence? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How long did you stay? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’m not sure, the trial was called off after that lunchtime period. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It was your plan to give this evidence in the court? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why didn’t you tell anybody via that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I did, I told his solicitor and his barrister, just not the whole story that it was mine, I just told him that it wasn’t his.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The appellant submitted that the questions concerning what the witness told the appellant’s legal representatives at Port Macquarie were well outside the scope of the grant of leave. Though the questions about her testimony at Port Macquarie were within the scope of the grant of leave, they created unfairness and prejudice because the cross-examination insinuated that her evidence on that occasion was inconsistent with her testimony, yet that could not be decided because the terms of her testimony at the Port Macquarie hearing were not set out.  
        
       
     16 The next passage complained about was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Now you say in your statement, and you made a statement on the 18 November 2000, that’s right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said that on the morning the police came that you couldn’t remember what you’d done with the heroin? 
         
        
        
         
         A. At first I couldn’t, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Right. And you said that Ian was handcuffed to a stair, to the stair, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was later on in the morning yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Okay. Did you see a video at any stage during the course of the search? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes they were making a video, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the video was recording the proceedings of the search? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Throughout the morning? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say that you were brought into the toilet? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were brought in when some items were recovered from the toilet bowl? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, that’s what they told me, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you say that the only thing you saw was the police officer opening a bag in the sink? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said that ‘That’s only rice’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who did you say that to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The police officer that was opening the bag of rice, there was a balloon I believe. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. A balloon? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And do you know who that police officer was? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t recall, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well was it Detective Richards the officer in charge of this matter? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I can’t recall, I believe it was a plain clothes – sorry a uniformed police officer. I can’t be sure no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The items recovered from the toilet bowl, that was the heroin that you had placed there is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You placed them in the toilet bowl? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did you put the rice in the toilet bowl? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t put the rice in the toilet bowl. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You told us that you saw a police officer opening a balloon that contained some rice? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it your understanding that that item came from the toilet bowl? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wasn’t sure at that point, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had you put the rice in the balloon? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did you know it was rice? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because he was opening it in front of me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How far away were you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Half a metre. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you were in the toilet area? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When that was taking place? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see a video camera operating at that point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I believe it was, I’m not sure if it was right there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say it was right there you mean it was video taping proceedings of you being shown this rice contained in the balloon being shown to you, is that what you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Probably, yes. The video tape was going the whole time the search was conducted I believe. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see that’s a lie isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s not a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say they pulled you back out of the toilet and you were sent back downstairs is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That whole story is a lie isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s not a lie it’s complete truth.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant submitted that the questioning about her evidence about handcuffing and its consistency with a police video was: 
        
        
         
         “cross-examination about a fact in issue at the trial. It went solely to credit. It was outside the scope of the grant of leave. It unfairly prejudiced the appellant.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The same submission was made in relation to what she saw the police do in connection with the toilet bowl. It was submitted that to question about whether the “whole story” about what happened during the search was a lie was “a very important breach of the grant of leave. It was a substantial attack on her credit generally about a fact in issue at the trial and was totally irrelevant to whether or not she had made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
        
       
     17 The next passage of which the appellant complained is: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You said in your statement that you were on the morning of the search that you were feeling a bit groggy? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And yet in your statement you said ‘About 20 minutes after they took Ian to the police station and about 5 minutes after that a police officer asked me to go down because Ian wished to speak to me’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were able to give pretty clear details as to what happened 20 minutes after Ian left three and a half years ago? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That was like two hours after, I was groggy when I first woke up. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you weren’t so groggy two hours later? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No not as much sir, no. I had glandular fever for two weeks prior to this and a week after, I was extremely sick. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The details you give there are pretty certain aren’t they, you say 20 minutes after Ian left, 20 minutes not 15 minutes or approximately half an hour, it was 20 minutes? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I probably would’ve said approximately, I can’t be sure how much it was – it was three hours ago – I’m sorry three years ago. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now you say it’s half an hour, right it was, it was three years and four months later you made that statement, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Right yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you said that the two policemen drove you to the station, when you got there they asked you to wait for about five or ten minutes and then they put you in the dock. That never happened did it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did happen. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. They didn’t put you in the dock did they? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I believe it was, yes at that time, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you say that they kept you in an interview room or a room for some hours, that’s right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That didn’t happen either did it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did happen, all of this happened.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     18 The appellant then criticised the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. All of this statement you’ve made is designed to cover up for Ian, for the accused isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It’s not cover up it’s to tell the truth, I’ve been guilty about this for three bloody years. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re feeling guilty about this. When you – on the morning of the search you were feeling guilty then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when you gave evidence at the – in May 1999 at Port Macquarie you were feeling guilty then? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The allegation that the witness was covering up for the appellant was said to demonstrate unfair prejudice.  
        
       
     19 The appellant then complained of questioning about whether the version given by the witness to the police on 20 November 2000 was correct: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And when you told the police in your original interview that those plastic bags were for horse samples, that was a lie wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Not it wasn’t a lie, that’s what they were used for as well. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The plastic bags were used for horse supplements you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you needed a digital electronic scales to measure those supplements is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And those supplements include vitamins and minerals that went into horse feed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that’s because you knew that those supplements were required for horses? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And isn’t it the case that supplements for horses are measured in scoops not grams? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No not in this – sorry, company, we measured it by grams, we used a whole range of vitamins from this one company which we measured in – on the scales. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It’s just rubbish isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A.. No that’s not rubbish. My mother and father will be here tomorrow to testify this, it’s all true, every bit of it and they know that, all my family, all my friends know it.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The appellant complained that this was outside the scope of the grant of leave, related to the facts of the trial, and was aggressive and confrontational. Ensuing questioning of a similar kind was also complained of.  
        
       
     20 The appellant then directed attention to certain evidence which, with preparatory questions, was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You waited three years, over three and a half years before telling this story? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. I was going to tell it at the first trial --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It’s really your intention to --- 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Sorry I don’t wish to talk over you, what did you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was going to say this at the first trial but it got called off.  
          
          
         Q. Of course that was some two years after the accused had been charged wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, about that time yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What you’re really trying to do is – were you trying to ambush the Court? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were just going to blurt this out in your evidence and that was going to end the trial? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was just going to tell the truth.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       The appellant complained that this was unfairly prejudicial because the questioner was contending that the witness had been attempting to pervert the course of justice in order to protect the appellant and had made another attempt to do so at Port Macquarie. 
        
       
     21 The next passage complained of was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. How long have you been letting the accused drive your car? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It’s not my car, it’s his dad’s car. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. He’s been using the car here in Newcastle? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’ve been using the car here in Newcastle? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I drove it the first day yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Who owns the car in the video – I’m sorry I withdraw that. The car that was parked at your residence on 18 July, who owned that one? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I believe that was Ian’s brother’s car. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you still in a relationship with the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Has he asked you to come and give this evidence today? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No you did.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       This questioning was said to be outside the scope of the grant of leave and to go solely to credibility. It was also said that there was no basis to suggest that the car had been transferred into the name of the witness for the purpose of inducing her to give false testimony on behalf of the appellant.  
        
       
     22 The appellant then complained about questions directed to the relationship between the witness and the appellant, and in particular whether he had ever stayed with the witness or the witness with him. These were said to go beyond the grant of leave. 
      
       
     23 The s 38 examination concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And you’ve made up this story to cover for him, haven’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you’ve come to this Court to tell lies for him, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that is not true.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     24 The appellant also complained about the following questions asked in re-examination by the Crown prosecutor: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You said the car wasn’t yours, that’s right? 
          
         A. Yes, it’s in my name but it’s Ian’s father’s car. 
          
         Q. Oh, right, it’s in your name? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
         Q. But it’s not yours. 
          
         A. No. 
          
         Q. And it was transferred to your name on 10 January 2001? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
         Q. You just forgot to tell us that did you? 
          
         A. You didn’t ask me. 
          
         Q. Another one of those instances where unless you’re asked you’re not going to tell us? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION.” 
         
        
        
       The essence of this complaint was that it was wrong to criticise the witness for not volunteering earlier that the car had been transferred on 10 January 2001.  
        
       
     25 The appellant submitted that the trial judge should have controlled “this uninhibited excess” by the use of s 38(6), s 135, s 137 and s 192(2). He submitted that by the end of the re-examination the trial had miscarried and no redirection could have cured the mischief. In any event the trial judge did not tell the jury that despite the Crown prosecutor’s questioning of the witness to suggest that she was covering up for the appellant, there was no evidence to suggest that she was lying to protect him at his instigation.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s arguments to this Court 
        
        
       The supposed analogy with R v Hogan 
        
       
     26 The appellant placed considerable reliance on R v Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292 as being a very similar case in which a conviction was overturned by reason of a misapplication of s 38.  
      
       
     27 The accused was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Matthew Gray in the backyard of his girlfriend, Rachel Golby, late one afternoon. He gave evidence that that morning he and Rachel Golby had been lying alongside each other in her bedroom when the accused entered and had a hostile conversation with them. Rachel Golby later told her mother in Gray’s presence what had happened. Gray then left, and returned for dinner. After dinner he watched television in Rachel Golby’s bedroom and then went into the backyard. He was then detained by the accused; he was asked to go to the accused’s car; he refused and called for Rachel; the accused then struck him and hit him three or four times with a post.  
      
       
     28 At the trial Rachel Golby in chief gave a version of the morning conversation in the bedroom materially different from Gray’s, namely that the accused said to Gray only “How are you going, mate.” Her evidence in chief about the conversation between herself, her mother and the complainant was also different. She said that after dinner she fell asleep until she heard a loud scream from outside. She accompanied Gray to hospital, and said that there, and on a later occasion, he indicated a desire to make a false allegation that the accused had bashed him.  
      
       
     29 The Crown prosecutor then applied for and obtained leave to examine under s 38 along the lines of prior inconsistent statements made in a witness statement dated 23 June 1998. Rachel Golby admitted making those statements to the police, which corroborated Gray’s version, but denied their truth. The examination under s 38 was described thus by Greg James J: 
      
       
        
         
         “The cross-examination was general in nature. It included cross-examination about what the witness had had to drink, whether or not she had taken heroin, whether she was on drugs and what drugs, including heroin, speed and ‘pills’ such as Serapax and Valium and marijuana she had taken. It developed into a wholesale attack on credit as well as dealing with those matters in relation to issues that were at least peripherally relevant at the trial or might have been relevant to the witness’ opportunities and capacity to observe what had occurred. She was specifically cross-examined on a number of occasions by the proposition being put to her that she was lying to protect the accused. The questioning asserted the content of prior inconsistent statements whether relevant to issues or on credit. Much of the cross-examination was prejudicial to the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         There was cross-examination which ranged so widely as to question her about whether the complainant and Rebecca Jones had been sleeping together which had caused a rift in her friendship with Rebecca Jones. There were questions put as to whether she had caught the two sleeping together and as to the nature of the house in which this had occurred. This was entirely collateral and far from the issue.” 
         
        
       
     30 There was also a successful s 38 application in relation to Rachel Golby’s mother. Its content was described thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “The cross-examination of Kathleen Golby raised matters as to the credit of Rachel Golby, hearsay as to the events in the backyard and assertions of her having denigrated the character and disposition of the appellant. Some of it was highly prejudicial to the appellant and of limited relevance.” 
         
        
       
     31 Greg James J then described evidence from other witnesses thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence that was led from Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis and Mrs Robertson of prior inconsistent accounts included matters that, at best, might have been relevant only as to credit on collateral or peripheral questions. There appears to have been no separate consideration of whether that evidence or any of it should have been permitted to be led. Much, it seems to me, should have been excluded.” 
         
        
       
     32 The appellant in the present appeal relied on the following remarks of Greg James J: 
      
       
        
         
         “The important matter is not whether such cross-examination might have elicited, amongst other evidence, evidence which might properly have been used in the trial. The issue, rather, concerns whether or not the questions as to such matters as were explored should have been permitted to be asked. It is necessary, when giving consideration to the grant of leave, to have regard to the effect on the trial of the ambit of questioning and of the matters that might be raised. It is essential when considering the grant of leave to consider how far, at least initially, cross-examination might be permitted to extend, having regard to the bounds set by s 38, to the matters to which regard must be had when granting leave in s 38(6) and s 192 and to whether prejudicial matters to which ss 135 and 137 might apply might be raised. 
         
        
        
         
         Leave might be further extended as a consequence of a further application, but lest the cross-examination should divert the focus of the trial as, in my view, it did here, it is necessary for a trial judge to take considerable caution in considering the matters the legislation and says [sic] the High Court has held he or she must consider and to give consideration to those matters by confining, at least initially, leave to that then seen as necessary, reconsidering the ambit in accordance with the criteria, if further leave is sought. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         I consider that the trial miscarried when his Honour granted leave, as he did, notwithstanding there was a basis on which in each case leave might have properly been granted. 
         
        
        
         
         Even if leave would almost certainly have been granted, it could not be successfully argued that would necessarily have permitted as wide an ambit of cross-examination as occurred. I conclude there was a miscarriage.” 
         
        
       
     33 The appellant also relied on what Giles JA said. In paragraph 4 he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It cannot realistically be doubted that, had there been regard to the s.192(2) matters, leave would have been given to question Rachel Golby as if cross-examining. But the leave would by no means have permitted the unfettered and wide-ranging questioning which was undertaken, apparently because all of the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the appellant considered that there were no restrictions on what Rachel Golby could be questioned about and in particular that her credit could be attacked. The extent of questioning led or contributed in turn to the calling of evidence from Rebecca Jones, Kerry Francis, Mrs. Kim Robertson and Detective Senior Constable Robinson about what Rachel Golby had been doing on the afternoon of 21 June 1998, what she had said to them, her drug habit, and Rebecca Jones' relationship with the complainant.” 
         
        
        
       
     34 In paragraph 5 he said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The result was to convert the focus of the trial from whether the appellant maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on the complainant to whether Rachel Golby was lying to protect the appellant - a proposition put to her on more than one occasion in the course of her questioning by the prosecution. The risk of prejudice to the appellant was high, particularly when the jury might have held Rachel Golby's lying against the appellant. There was nothing to suggest that she was lying to protect him at his instigation.” 
         
        
       
     35 The appellant submitted to this Court that the examination of Amber O’Brien: 
      
       
        
         
         “went to issues that were solely issues of credit outside of the terms of the statements and in particular the cross-examination was crafted so as to demonstrate that it was given false evidence as part of an arrangement with the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         Part of that arrangement, it was submitted, was that the appellant had transferred the registration of a motor vehicle into the name of the witness so that she would give false testimony in his aid at the time of the trial. None of that was the subject properly of a grant of leave because it raised fundamental issues of fairness. It should have [been] disallowed because of the operation of s 135 and/or s [137] at the very least. Ultimately, the focus of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of the witness was not whether or not the witness could be accepted or rejected but whether the appellant had acted with her in concert to performing in the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         The trial miscarried in exactly the same way as the trial miscarried in Hogan’s case and the comment of Giles JA and Greg James J in that case are pertinent in this case . …” 
         
        
       
     36 Referring to the last part of the passage quoted from Giles JA’s judgment, the appellant in this appeal said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That is exactly what happened here. The prosecutor cross-examined a witness, pointedly, about the fact that she was lying and lying at the insistence of the appellant. There was no evidence at all to support that contention. Not even the evidence that a car had been registered in her name.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge’s failure to consider the provisions of the Evidence Act 
        
       
     37 In relation to the decision to grant leave, the appellant’s written submissions state: 
      
       
        
         
         “In his ruling, His Honour did not have regard to s 192, 135, 137, 102, 103 and 60 of the Evidence Act. The terms of the judgment seem to suggest that the scope of the cross-examination for which leave was granted was limited to cross-examination on the prior inconsistent statements and the evidence that the witness gave at Port Macquarie. Despite the terms of the ruling, the cross-examination that the Crown Prosecutor embarked upon was wide ranging and extended well outside the narrow scope of the terms of the grant of leave. 
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Stanoevski v The Queen 
          (2001) 202 CLR 115, the High Court held that s 192 was a mandatory requirement for the grant of leave for cross-examination on character. In  
         Regina v Garry Hogan 
          [2001] NSWCCA 292 (3 August 2001), this Court held that s 192 applied to grants of leave to cross-examine pursuant to s 38. In  
         Stanoevski 
         , Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ held: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Section 192 applies to this case, and in particular to the exercise by the trial judge of his or her discretion under section 112 of the Act. It should be noted that the leave required under section 112 was not leave to adduce evidence, but to cross-examine about the character of the defendant. In addition to matters which may be relevant in a particular case, in all cases the Court must take into account the matters prescribed by section 192(2). It is clear here that the trial judge (probably because his attention does not seem to have been drawn to it) did not take into account all of those matters, some of which would inevitably have been relevant to the way in which his discretion ought to be exercised had he adverted to them.’ (Paragraph 41) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Those words apply in this case. Further, their Honours held (at paragraph 43): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The cross-examination on the report raised a very grave possibility of unfairness to the Appellant within the meaning of section 192(2)(b). By giving permission for that cross-examination to take place, the trial judge was allowing the undertaking of an extensive collateral enquiry by the prosecutor.’ 
            
           
          
         Further, their Honours held: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘It follows that matters of the kind which section 192(2) provides should be considered where of relevance to this case and to the trial judge’s decision to permit the prosecutor to cross-examine as he did. In not taking properly these, and matters of weight and relevance into account, and in not therefore exercising his discretion in accordance with section 192 of the Act, the trial judge fell into error.’ (Paragraph 47) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Regina v Fowler  
         [2000] NSWCCA 142 (23 May 2000), this Court also stressed the need to have regard to s 192 and s 135 to 137 of the Evidence Act. Wood CJ at CL stated (at paragraph 120): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Section 38 of the Evidence Act now permits a party, by leave, to cross-examine a witness who meets any of the criteria identified in subsection 1. Its exercise is, however, subject to a number of discretionary considerations, so as to prevent its abuse, and is a section that needs to be applied with some care in criminal trials. So it is that before leave is granted, the trial judge must give consideration to the matters specified in sections 38(6), 135-137, and 192 of the Act.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is significant that s 135-137 and 192 are mandatory. In the instant case, His Honour did not advert to any of these sections whereas matters of the kind specified by those sections which should be considered were of relevance in the case. There is no doubt that leave would have been granted to cross-examine the witness if regard had been paid to s 192(2) but the leave would by no means have permitted the wide ranging questioning which was eventually undertaken by the Crown Prosecutor. The result was to convert the focus of the trial onto whether or not Amber O’Brien was lying to protect the Appellant – the proposition that was put to her on more than one occasion in the course of her questioning by the Prosecutor. As Giles JA held in  
         Hogan 
         , a very similar case: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The risk of prejudice to the appellant was high, particularly when the jury might have held Rachel Goldbys lying against the appellant. There was nothing to suggest that she was lying to protect him at his instigation.’ (Paragraph 5).  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         A proper exercise of s 135 and 137 would have required the Judge to deny the Prosecutor the right to adduce many of the answers that were obtained from Ms O’Brien because of the risk that the jury would unfairly and improperly attribute responsibility for her answers to the Appellant.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge’s alleged errors in the procedure for granting leave 
        
       
     38 The appellant’s oral argument to this Court on the procedure that should have been adopted when the trial judge granted leave under s 38 was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “What should have happened was that the judge should have granted leave to cross-examine the witness on the prior inconsistent statements, then following upon such cross-examination, if the Crown sought to ask particular questions about credit only, there should have been demonstrated some basis for the grant of leave. It would have required the Crown to outline what they intended to ask at least by way of topics so that the judge could consider whether there was a need to limit the questioning either by refusing leave under Subs 3 or limiting its terms, but by granting leave at the outset under Subs 3 without specifying what could or could not be asked, that then gave the Prosecutor free rein to ask any questions on credit that occurred to them and that then led to numerous instances of questions that went solely to undermine the credit of the witness, some of them included questions that were designed to suggest to the jury that the witness was acting as an agent of the appellant when there was no proper basis for such questions.” 
         
        
       
     39 The appellant submitted that when the Crown called Amber O’Brien it believed she was not a witness of truth, that it had no obligation to call her and that it “could have made her available to the accused”. Section 38 permitted the Crown to call her and obtain leave to put prior inconsistent statements to her, but s 38 was a new facility in the law of evidence which had to be handled with care and not used in “demolition of a straw person that is designed not [to advance] the prosecution case but to taint the accused”. In particular, care had to be employed where the Crown “consciously and deliberately” called a witness believed by it to be untruthful. It was desirable to proceed in stages. The first stage was to permit questioning about the inconsistent statements. If the Crown wished to proceed further, it should make another application. If the Crown wanted to establish that when the prior inconsistent statements were given to the police, the witness had had time to reflect about the matter, and her mother was present to assist, as the Crown prosecutor actually did, that might be permissible, but only after a further grant of leave. If the Crown wanted to establish that the 18 November 2000 police statement, inconsistent with that given to the police on 18 July 1997 but consistent with the evidence in chief, was made much later than the 18 July 1997 interview, it might be permitted to do so, but only after the grant of further leave. The same applied to inquiries into why the witness’ version changed – whether because or some faulty recollection, or because of being under great stress at one time rather than another, or because of some disease, or because of some particular motive, or because of a sudden attack of conscience. On each application the counsel seeking leave had to be particular as to the terms of the application, and the court had to be particular as to the terms in which it was granted.  
      
       
     40 The appellant submitted that if counsel desired to suggest that a witness under s 38 examination was lying to protect the accused, either of that witness’ own volition or at the instigation of the accused, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider whether the evidence had probative value and whether there was a risk of unfair prejudice to the accused. The risk arose from suggestions that Amber O’Brien had been brought to court by the accused to give evidence in his favour by reason of some corrupt relationship, whereas it was the Crown who had brought her to court believing she was dishonest, intent on prejudicing the appellant by tainting him with her dishonesty, and not possessed of any evidence of a corrupt relationship.  
      
       
     41 These circumstances made it necessary to consider with care the terms of s 38 leave and to grant the leave only in a confined way. Even though the witness denied what was put to her in various prejudicial and inflammatory questions, the very nature of the questioning was so inflammatory as to make the trial unfair.  
      
       
     42 In short, the appellant submitted that before s 38 was enacted, the Crown could not cross-examine its own witness. He submitted that in order to avoid a dangerous revolution in the law, s 38 should be read narrowly so as to permit leave only in precisely identified circumstances. He submitted that what the Crown might do in cross-examining the witness had she been called by the accused was no guide to what it might do in asking s 38 questions, because, if called by the accused, she was being held out by the accused as a witness of truth, and excessive s 38 questioning of a witness called by the Crown who was favourable to the accused would cause the jury to jump to the conclusion that the accused was guilty because the witness who was favourable to him was demonstrably dishonest.  
      
       
        
       The non-assistance of counsel 
        
         
        
       
     43 The trial in this case took place in March 2001, shortly after the High Court gave judgment in Stanoevski v R on 8 February 2001, but probably before that case was reported. The trial was before R v Hogan was decided on 3 August 2001. However, the necessity of taking into account ss 135, 137 and 192 in relation to s 38 applications was well known before those cases: see the lengthy analysis of Wood CJ at CL in R v Adam (unreported, 3 December 1998).  
      
       
     44 It is, of course, highly unsatisfactory that the appellant’s counsel before this Court (who did not appear at the trial) is relying on the trial judge’s failure to pay regard to ss 135, 137 and 192, when his predecessor at the trial did not remind the trial judge of them. The Crown notes that fact, but accepts that “the solicitor advocate appearing as Crown prosecutor” did not remind the trial judge of the sections either. The Crown did not formally take the point that leave is needed under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, and the terms of what is said in the cases relied on by the appellant make that course understandable. 
      
       
        
       The Crown’s arguments to this Court 
        
       
     45 The Crown’s written submissions state: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted, however, the mere fact that His Honour did not mention section 192, or sections 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act does not necessarily illustrate that His Honour failed to consider the matters set out therein when coming to the decision to allow cross-examination pursuant to section 38. His Honour’s ruling limited the cross-examination and His Honour did specifically grant leave under section 38(3) to enable cross-examination as to credibility only. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted the instant matter is distinguishable from that which prevailed in Regina v Gary Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292.”  
         
        
        
       
     46 The Crown submitted simply that the leave granted was justifiable because of the witness’ prior inconsistent statements to the police and at Port Macquarie, and that no efficient examination about the prior inconsistent statements could be carried out without questioning about credit. There was no need to explore the Port Macquarie evidence with greater particularity. Questioning directed to why the witness had changed her story and whether it was part of an attempt to assist the accused was common and permissible; indeed a jury inference that that was the reason was both possible and likely.  
      
       
        
       Was the trial judge’s grant of leave vitiated by error of law? 
        
         
        
       
     47 The contention by the Crown that the failure to mention ss 135, 137 or 192 does not mean that the trial judge did not consider the relevant questions may be correct in the abstract, but there is nothing positive in the reasons for judgment to suggest that the trial judge did in fact consider the questions. An inference that a judge took particular matters into account can sometimes be drawn from the fact that they were mentioned in argument. The sections in terms were not mentioned in argument. Nor were the substantive elements of them. The entire argument, quoted above, proceeded on the basis that the only relevant enactment was s 38. Yet the terms of s 137 and s 192 are mandatory. They must be complied with whether or not a party who might gain from their invocation actually invokes them. It is notable that Part 3.11 (in which s 137 appears) and Chapter 5 (in which s 192 appears) are not listed as among the provisions which the court may, with the parties’ consent, dispense with: s 190. It is unnecessary to discuss the extent to which s 135 is mandatory or the extent to which a court should apply it even though no party requests this. The conclusion that the trial judge did not pay regard to s 137 and s 192 is beyond rational argument.  
      
       
     48 The Crown’s submission that R v Hogan is distinguishable in this respect from the present case was unsupported by any reasoning in either the written or the oral submissions. How it could be distinguished is unclear; in any event the conclusion of that case that at least s 137 and s 192 apply in all s 38 cases makes it very hard to imagine how it could be distinguished. That conclusion is also supported by Adam v R (2001) 183 ALR 625. In that case the trial judge, Wood CJ at CL, took into account ss 135-137 and 192: R v Adam (unreported, 3 December 1998). The High Court mentioned the fact that the trial judge “referred expressly to the various considerations mentioned in s 192(2)” and also referred, implicitly with approval, to the fact that he took s 137 into account: [28]. Perusal of Wood CJ at CL’s reasons for judgment, incidentally, reveals the type of argument called for on the part of counsel where questions arising under s 38 applications are to be explored, though it is not suggested that the complexity of the issues at the trial in the present case approached those in Adam v R.  
      
       
     49 It follows that the s 38 order which the trial judge made was under an error of law. However, the conviction could still stand if the Crown could establish that the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant the prosecution’s application under s 38 even if all relevant provisions had been taken into account: Stanoevski v R (2001) 202 CLR 115 at [56] per McHugh J. 
      
       
        
       Would the trial judge, directing himself properly, have made a s 38 order? 
        
       
     50 Had the trial judge considered s 192, it is likely that he would have reasoned, and reasoned legitimately, as follows. In relation to s 192(2)(a), though a s 38 order would obviously lengthen the hearing, it would not do so unduly: the s 38 examination in fact only took up eleven pages of transcript. In relation to s 192(2)(b), leave to cross-examine at least on the differences between the evidence in chief and the record of interview would not have been unfair to either the witness or the appellant. As to s 192(2)(c), the evidence was very important. As to s 192(2)(d), the nature of the proceeding was a neutral fact. There was no relevantly useful power of the type referred to in s 192(2)(e). Turning to s 137, the probative value of concessions by the witness about what she had said to the police (in an electronically recorded interview) was potentially very high; that value might be reduced by any explanation given by the witness, but that was a matter for jury evaluation. The potential probative value wholly outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant; and if the evidence turned out to be of low probative value, there would be no unfair prejudice to the appellant. The application of s 135 could not lead to any different outcome.  
      
       
     51 The appellant’s written submissions do not in terms deny that the trial judge, had he had all relevant provisions in mind, would have granted leave to cross-examine the witness about her evidence at Port Macquarie in May 1999. In so far as that evidence did not disclose that she was the owner of the drugs, and questions addressed to her would, if truthfully answered, have revealed that she was not, it could be described as being inconsistent with her evidence in chief. In so far as her evidence at Port Macquarie asserted that the appellant was the owner of the drugs, it would have been explicitly inconsistent with her evidence in chief. Accordingly, subject to its precise terms, the Port Macquarie evidence did not fall into a different category from the record of interview of 18 July 1997. Its terms were not tendered to the trial judge in the s 38 application, but counsel for the appellant then appearing took no point about that.  
      
       
     52 The appellant’s written submissions conceded that there “is no doubt that leave would have been granted to cross-examine the witness if regard had been paid to s 192(2)”. But they go on to contend that the leave should not have permitted questioning about whether the witness was lying to protect the appellant, or lying to protect the appellant at his instigation. In oral argument the appellant also submitted that leave to examine on credit should not have been given; and also that leave in relation to Port Macquarie should not have been given without more precision being introduced.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s arguments as a whole considered 
        
        
       The significance of the appellant’s non-objection 
        
       
     53 The arguments of the appellant in support of these grounds had a double aspect, though it did not always sharply emerge. One element was that the s 38 examination extended beyond the scope of the actual leave granted. Another was that the s 38 examination extended beyond any permissible leave which might have been granted. The distinction could be important, because over the eleven pages of impugned s 38 examination, counsel for the appellant interrupted only four times: once to say he could not hear one answer (an experience shared by the Crown prosecutor), once to object after seven pages and twice to object near the end. An examination which was not objected to which, while it went outside the scope of the leave granted, remained within the scope of the leave which the court had power to grant, might be less likely to cause an appeal to be allowed than an examination which was not objected to but which went wholly outside the scope of the court’s power under s 38. The latter type of examination would be an examination beyond what parliament contemplated as being compatible with an appropriately conducted trial.  
      
       
     54 There may be some significance in the fact that counsel for the appellant at the trial had been in practice for thirteen years – that is, he was experienced. It is a common perception of experienced counsel that frequent interruptions of cross-examination often irritate judges and juries because they can often have the effect, and sometimes, regrettably, have the purpose, of putting the cross-examiner off, giving the witness an opportunity to think of a convenient answer, or simply giving the witness a rest. They also have the effect, and, even more regrettably, on occasion the purpose, of feeding to the witness an answer which objecting counsel desires the witness to give. Section 38 examinations are much rarer than true cross-examination, but to the extent that they are a limited kind of cross-examination, counsel at a trial might well wish to be prudent and selective in the extent to which a s 38 examination should be interrupted, lest judge and jury react adversely. Judgments of this kind have to be made question by question in trials conducted orally, and the soundness of those judgments is not readily to be impugned by minute textual analysis conducted at leisure with hindsight.  
      
       
        
       The meaning of “about” 
        
       
     55 There is an assumption underlying the appellant’s submissions which, though not clearly articulated, is important. The submissions start with the incontrovertible proposition that leave under s 38 does not justify general cross-examination, using the leading questions (s 42) and aggression characteristic of cross-examination, on any subject relevant to an issue or to credit. Section 38 permits the party who obtains the leave to question “as though the party were cross-examining a witness”, but only “about” the three subjects described in paragraphs (a)-(c). The assumption on which the appellant’s submissions proceeded is that those three subjects are narrow and that the word “about” is not a word denoting an extensive connection between a question and each of the subjects.  
      
       
     56 Though in terms the application to him was only based on s 38(1)(c), the trial judge made it plain that the leave he granted was based on s 38(1)(a) (in relation both to the record of interview and the Port Macquarie trial) but apparently also on s 38(1)(c) at least so far as the record of interview as concerned. Though there were arguably signs in the examination in chief before the s 38 application was made that s 38(1)(b) might apply, the application was not advanced on that basis and the trial judge did not mention it.  
      
       
     57 It is important to bear in mind that so far as s 38 examination elicits evidence of prior inconsistent statements containing hearsay, though they can be admitted merely on credit, they can also be admitted to prove the facts asserted by reason of s 60, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     58 Section 102 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       That is described as “the credibility rule”: Dictionary, Part 1. Further, s 103 provides: 
        
        
        
         
         “(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has substantial probative value. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard in deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value, it is to have regard to: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.” 
         
        
        
       If the court gives leave under s 38(3), the questioning must be in accordance with Part 3.7, and in this case in particular ss 102 and 103:  
       Adam v R 
        (2001) 183 ALR 625 at [24] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ.  
        
       
     59 The relevant Macquarie Dictionary definitions of “about” suggest that to ask a question about a subject is to ask a question concerning it, or in regard to it, or connected with it, or concerned with it. The relevant definitions in the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) of “about” suggest that to ask a question about a subject is to ask a question touching it, concerning it, in the matter of it, in reference to it, or in regard to it. The word “about” is the “regular proposition employed to define the subject-matter of verbal activity …”. At times the appellant’s submissions implied that a party questioning under s 38 could do no more than put a version which was to the contrary of the unfavourable evidence, or put the party’s version of the matter which the witness was not genuinely attempting to testify about, or put the terms of the prior inconsistent statements. Those dictionary definitions suggest that the party conducting s 38 questioning could range more widely than that.  
      
       
     60 In the Interim Report of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC 26) on Evidence, the following clause appeared in the draft Bill proposed: 
      
       
        
         
         “34. (1) Where a witness gives evidence that is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, that party may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about that evidence as though the party were cross-examining the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Where, in examination in chief, a witness appears to the court not to be making a genuine attempt to give evidence about a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge, the party who called the witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about that matter as though the party were cross-examining the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) The questioning shall not take place until after the other parties have had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The matters that the court shall take into account in determining whether to give leave under this section include - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the matters on which and the extent to which the witness has been questioned by some other party; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     61 In the Interim Report, para 625, which appears after a discussion of the narrowness of the test for hostile witnesses under the then law, the Commission said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Hostile Witness – Proposal 
         . It is proposed that the law relating to ‘hostile’ witness be abrogated. The criticisms of the law, and the absence of any satisfactory rationale justifies this course. Further the need for accurate fact finding and considerations of fairness justify allowing a party to test by cross-examination that part of a witness’ testimony that is unfavourable to the case of the party whether the witness was called by the party or not. If the party does not test such evidence it is likely that no one will. The proposals may also encourage parties to call witnesses, often the most credible available. The major danger with such an approach is that it may add to the time and cost of litigation. Several factors will minimise this danger: 
         
        
       
     · Decision to call Witness. Parties will generally know what evidence a witness wishes to give. If they can avoid it, they will not call a witness whose evidence is unfavourable on important points. While the proposal would make it less dangerous for a party to call such a witness, a party will still be reluctant to do so. It is unlikely that it will call such a witness unless the evidence he can give supporting the case is important and that which does not is unimportant, or can be successfully challenged.  
      
       
     · The Inconsistent Statement. The most likely situation will be one where the witness fails to swear up to his proof of evidence. The law presently permits cross-questioning in this situation with the leave of the court. 
      
       
     · Advantages of Discrepancies. Discrepancies between the evidence of witnesses called by a party can enhance the value of their evidence. This provides another reason for not cross-questioning the witness where the conflict is on non-essential issues. 
      
       
     · Tactical. A party will be reluctant to attack the credibility of a witness where it wishes to rely on the test of that witness’ evidence. Thus, it is likely that the witness will be challenged only where there is a significant conflict of evidence and any challenge would be restricted to the evidence given and would not extend to the general issue of the character or credibility of the witness. To so extend the attack would damage the credibility of the testimony as a whole. 
      
       
        
         
         Against the risk of adding to time and costs of litigation should be balanced the saving of time that may occur when a key witness favourable to each party is called, because of the changes made by the proposals. A distinction needs to be drawn between the following procedures: 
         
        
       
     · Cross-questioning the witness on the unfavourable evidence; 
      
       
     · Cross-questioning the witness to attack the credibility of the witness; 
      
       
     · Leading evidence through other witnesses that relates only to the credibility of the witness. 
      
       
        
         
         It is suggested that the advantages of allowing the cross-questioning on the unfavourable evidence clearly prevail. Leave should be required – so that the cross-questioning can be controlled by the judge. It is provided, however, that it should only occur after all other parties have had an opportunity to question the witness. As to the remaining two categories, the advantages are more debateable and the risk of wasting time and cost greater. There will be occasions – for example where the witness fails to swear up to his proofs because of bias – where clearly such questioning and evidence should be allowed. On the other hand, there will be cases where the unfavourable evidence is not of major importance and the attack on credibility of little weight. The proposals advanced on character and conduct evidence will limit the cross-examination and the calling of other evidence. Nonetheless, control in this situation is desirable. It is proposed that leave be required.” 
         
        
       
     62 It appears to follow from the last sentence that the Commission favoured what it called “Cross-questioning the witness to attack the credibility of the witness”, but took the view that the need to obtain the court’s leave would be a sufficient safeguard against abuse in cases where the unfavourable evidence was not of major significance and the attack on credibility of little weight. That view is supported by the third and fourth sentences, in their reference to “allowing a party to test by cross-examination that part of a witness’s testimony that is unfavourable to the case of the party”, on the ground that if that party did not test the evidence, it is likely that no-one would.63 In its Report on Evidence (ALRC 38), para 114(a), the Commission said: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a)  
         Cross-examination of the unfavourable witness 
         . It was proposed that the party who called the witness could, with leave of the court, question the witness about the unfavourable evidence as though the party were cross-examining the witness. This imported the rules proposed for the manner of cross-examination and was intended to enable the rules on the admissibility of evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness to be applied. The intention was that these rules, together with the leave requirement, would provide the machinery needed. As pointed out in the Interim Report, circumstances will vary – on the one hand a witness may fail to swear up to a proof of evidence because of bias and a full attack on credibility would be warranted; on the other hand the unfavourable evidence may not be of major importance and the proposed attack on credibility may be insignificant. Commentators, however, pointed out that the draft could be construed as not allowing cross-examination going solely to credibility.15” 
         
        
         
        
         
        
       Note 15 was: 
        
        
         
         “The difficulty lay in the expressions ‘a party … may question the witness about  
         that evidence 
          as through … cross-examining the witness’ and ‘a party … may question the witness about  
         that matter 
          … .” 
         
        
        
       The text continued: 
        
        
         
         “It should be made clear that cross-examination on matters relevant to the credibility of the witness is also permissible but only with leave of the court. An alternative would be to remove the reference to the evidence given by the witness so that cross-examination cannot be said to be limited to it. This, however, would remove all limits other than the leave requirement.16” 
         
        
        
       Note 16 was: 
        
        
         
         “Consideration was given to distinguishing between two situations: on the one hand, the witness who gives some favourable evidence and, on the other hand, the witness who gives totally unfavourable evidence or suffers a total loss of memory. In the former, consideration could be given to not allowing any cross-examination as to credibility. In the latter, however, it could be allowed. The above distinctions can be described and are cases that will arise. But they are not the only cases and there can be considerable variation. Any proposal advanced should be available to control all situations. Hence this alternative has not been adopted.” 
         
        
       
     64 The Commission’s reasoning did not lead it to alter the words “that evidence” and “that matter”, but did lead to the introduction of sub-clause (3) into clause 41, which corresponded to clause 34 in the Bill appearing in the Interim Report and to s 38 of the Evidence Act. The new clause 41 read: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where a witness gives evidence that is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, that party may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about that evidence as though the party were cross-examining the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Where, in examination in chief, a witness appears to the court not to be making a genuine attempt to give evidence about a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge, the party who called the witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about that matter as though the party were cross-examining the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) A party who is questioning a witness as mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) may also, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the credibility of the witness, and such questioning shall be taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) Unless the court otherwise directs, questioning as mentioned in this section shall take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) Where the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness shall be as the court directs. 
         
        
        
         
         (6) The matters that the court shall take into account in determining whether to give leave, or give a direction, under this section include - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by some other party.” 
         
        
        
       The new sub-clause (3) corresponds with s 38(3).  
        
       
     65 In short, the Commission was concerned to limit the topics on which the examination of unfavourable witnesses could take place, but wished to permit cross-examination relating to those topics even though it went only to the credibility of the witness’s evidence about those topics.  
      
       
     66 One purpose of a s 38 examination must be to enable counsel calling the witness to demonstrate that the evidence in chief which led to the s 38 order is false. Another must be to enable counsel to demonstrate that any prior statement inconsistent with it is true. That latter purpose is assisted by s 60, which permits a prior inconsistent statement to be considered as evidence of what is represented, not merely as a matter affecting credibility. But s 60 by itself is not wholly effectual unless the questioner is able to interrogate with a view to demonstrating the truth of the prior inconsistent statement. There would be little point in permitting s 38 examinations otherwise and no point in the existence of s 38(3). The purposes described can be assisted by obtaining concessions from the witness about matters tending to indicate the falsity of the impugned evidence. One of these is the lateness with which the impugned story is advanced. Another is the inherent improbability of the impugned story. These purposes must also be capable of being assisted by the eliciting of evidence tending to show the truthfulness of prior statements inconsistent with the impugned evidence, such as the fact that they were made under conditions conducive to accurate recollection and expression and conducive to sincerity.  
      
       
     67 In my opinion, on the true construction of s 38, leave may be granted under s 38 to conduct questioning not only if the questioning is specifically directed to one of the three subjects described in s 38(1), but also if it is directed to establishing the probability of the factual state of affairs in relation to those subjects contended for by the party conducting the questioning or the improbability of the witness’s evidence on those subjects. In establishing the probability or improbability of one or other state of affairs, the questioner is entitled to ask questions about matters going only to credibility with a view to shaking the witness’s credibility on the s 38(1) subjects.  
      
       
        
       Did the Crown adopt the right course in calling Amber O’Brien? 
        
       
     68 There is no reason to suppose that the Crown believed Amber O’Brien would tell untruths in the sense of departing in chief from the answers given in her police interview of 18 July 1997. Obviously the Crown saw that as a possibility, perhaps a strong possibility, and had prepared itself to deal with that possibility. But it was not a certainty. Contrary to some of the suggestions advanced by the appellant, it was not improper for Amber O’Brien to be called by the Crown. No ground of appeal complained of her having been called, and no amendment to the Notice of Appeal was applied for when this circumstance was pointed out. In fact it was the Crown’s duty to call Amber O’Brien, and if it had not called her that fact would have been made the subject of a ground of appeal. It was the Crown’s duty to call her because of her 18 July 1997 record of interview, her occupancy of the room where drugs equipment was found, and her presence in the townhouse where the drugs themselves were found. She was essential to the unfolding of the narrative underlying the Crown case. Obviously she was a reliable witness in the sense that one of her two versions must have been reliable: the question was – which? She was not an unreliable witness who had given many versions, all of questionable reliability; or a person whose single version was demonstrably false; or a person whose reliability was doubtful because of some mental disturbance. It was not correct to describe the calling of Amber O’Brien as an improper introduction of a “straw person” simply for the purpose of tainting the accused. The whole history of the matter made it inevitable that she be called. The obligation to call a witness does not create an obligation to embrace and accept whatever that witness says: the very existence of s 38 reinforces an obligation to test what is said in the interests of justice. Defence counsel did not protest at the calling of Amber O’Brien by the Crown, no doubt for the very good reason that she afforded him a highly unusual and potentially powerful weapon. Her evidence in chief cannot have surprised him, and he could have made considerable progress towards an acquittal by pointing out to the jury what she might lose by giving her evidence (without any protection under the Evidence Act s 128), and that so young and vulnerable a woman had no reason to damage her own interests unless she was telling the truth. For the Crown to have permitted that possible line to remain open in an unqualified way without legitimate testing of her position in a s 38 examination would have been damaging to the public interest and the administration of justice. The appellant suggested that if the Crown were to call her it should have done no more than call her, elicit her name, address and occupation, and leave her to be cross-examined by the appellant. Had this been done, she would no doubt have given the evidence in cross-examination which she in fact gave in chief exculpating the appellant, and it might have been very difficult for the Crown to obtain leave to conduct s 38 questioning in re-examination: see s 38(4). It is hard to see how in any sense justice would have been furthered by the course proposed by the appellant.  
      
       
        
       Evaluation of the appellant’s suggested procedure 
        
       
     69 In R v Novac (1976) 65 Cr App R 109 at 119 Bridge LJ, Wien and Jones JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In jury trial brevity and simplicity are the hand-maidens of justice, length and complexity its enemies.” 
         
        
       
     70 One factor tending to make jury trials longer and more complex is the practice of excessive applications being made in the absence of the jury. Ideally the evidence tendered to the jury will flow not only logically but smoothly. Conventional court sitting hours are appropriate periods within which the jury can concentrate on the evidence as it is given. Concentration is enhanced if interruptions of indeterminate and unpredictable length are avoided. That is why judges customarily endeavour to channel applications into periods of short adjournments during the day, or periods at the end of or the start of each day’s proceedings.  
      
       
     71 Another reason for that approach is that the frequent sending of jurors out of court is likely to exacerbate unduly a sense on the part of the jurors that they are not participating fully in the trial and that important matters are being discussed secretly in their absence. That in turn may provoke a desire to speculate, perhaps misleadingly, about what it is that is being discussed in their absence. 
      
       
     72 Further, the position of counsel must be considered. Though counsel conducting questioning under s 38 are not strictly cross-examining, the witness being questioned is ex hypothesi a witness over whose credibility there is a cloud and who may give quite unpredictable answers. It is not easy for counsel to be sure, at the time when any s 38 application is made, whether the terms of the leave requested will be adequate to cover all circumstances. Section 38 questioning, like cross-examination, must be permitted to have a measure of freedom. Truth will often out when counsel who is asking the questions turns out to be a little more quick-witted than the witness. The legitimate exploitation by counsel of any advantages they have in this respect is wrongly impeded if their questioning is artificially interrupted, whether by events external to the trial, or non-responsive answers from the witness, or captious objections, or the need to seek further grants of leave under s 38 at short intervals. Counsel questioning pursuant to s 38 must be able to adjust to meet new circumstances quickly, without the witness being able to take advantage of intervals in which new s 38 applications are made as opportunities to have a rest or reconsider the posture to be adopted in manoeuvring to meet the different challenges made by the questioner.  
      
       
     73 The technique advocated by the appellant cuts across all these considerations. No doubt it will often not be right to grant leave to ask s 38 questions on the widest possible basis at the outset. But it will often not be right for the court to distribute small dollops of leave in response to repeated small-scale applications. That would produce a stop-start approach to questions which is likely to be ineffective, likely to distract the jury as they go in and out, likely to lengthen the trial, and likely to make it more complex. It is a question of judgment to be made in the circumstances of each case what the extent of a particular grant of leave should be, and how far the questioner should be forced to make more than one application.  
      
       
        
       Where was the prejudice alleged? 
        
       
     74 Here there were virtually no objections to the questions now said to be prejudicial. There was no attempt to clarify the extent of the leave granted and no attempt to contend that particular questions as they were asked went beyond the leave granted. It is a fair inference that in the atmosphere of the trial defence counsel did not perceive the questioning to be unfairly prejudicial.  
      
       
     75 The appellant’s submission that the questioning of the witness, in view of her dishonesty, would have a prejudicial effect on the appellant ignores the necessities of the circumstances. At trial, the appellant’s position was that notwithstanding what he said to the police, the drugs were not his. At the trial, Amber O’Brien’s position was that notwithstanding what she said to the police, the drugs were hers. On 18 July 1997 each had adopted a position which was the opposite of that adopted at the trial. The two versions at the different times were so interwoven that a consideration of one necessarily had an impact on the other. The central issue was: “Was the accused innocent because she is guilty?” Her evidence went directly to that issue, and that made a s 38 examination of a searching kind justifiable. It is inaccurate to describe the s 38 examination, as the appellant’s written submissions repeatedly did, as going merely to “credibility” in the sense in which that expression is generally understood. Not only did she change her version, but it coincided with a change in his version in the sense that as early as the Port Macquarie hearing in May 1999 he was contending that his confession was false and she, according to her evidence before Coolahan DCJ, told the accused’s lawyers that the heroin was not his. There was an identity of motive alleged, too: each said at the trial that their records of interview on 18 July 1997 were false because of police pressure, though in addition he said he wished to protect her; by the time of the trial, she said she wished to protect him. In Palmer v R (1998) 193 CLR 1 at [51] McHugh J said that “in some cases, the credibility of a witness may be of such crucial importance that it is decisive of the facts-in-issue, particularly where … the witness is a participant in the very facts-in-issue or the only eye witness to them.” This is a case of that kind. She lived in the appellant’s townhouse, she slept in the room where drug-related equipment was found, and she was present when the police found the drugs.  
      
       
     76 The trial judge, though he erred in the process by which he decided to grant leave under s 38, did not err in granting leave on too wide a basis. It was legitimate to grant leave which would permit an examination of what was said and what was not said on particular occasions, what the circumstances affecting the various occasions were, and what particular reasons the witness might have for having behaved in particular ways on particular occasions.  
      
       
     77 It is, of course, possible that even though leave was granted in appropriate terms, the particular questioning pursuant to that leave might have led to a miscarriage. It is also possible that questioning going beyond the terms of the leave might have led to a miscarriage. That depends upon an analysis of the particular questions. 
      
       
     78 So far as the appellant complains about questioning to do with the fact that before her police interview on 18 July 1997 Amber O’Brien was able to wait in the foyer of the police station for her mother to arrive, had an opportunity to think about the morning’s events, had a further opportunity to do so in the hours before being interviewed, and did not tell either the police officers or her mother that it was she and not the appellant who was guilty, the questioning was permissible. It went to the reliability of the two versions. It showed that she had every opportunity to consider her position and tell the police the truth at a time when the relevant events were fresh in her mind. It was not unreasonable to suggest to the witness that if she was in truth the owner and primary intended user of the heroin and if she in truth obtained it from someone other than the appellant, it was surprising that she did not protest to the police and exculpate the appellant there and then. After all, she was cohabiting with him. Her failure to protest, unless explained, increased the probability of her record of interview being correct, and the improbability of her evidence in chief being correct. It was not unreasonable to elicit from the witness the fact that she had had time to collect her thoughts both before her mother arrived and before the interview began. Even if it can be said that the questions “went solely to credibility”, the judge’s order permitted that. In a sense they did not go “solely” to credibility, because the material was clearly connected to what had actually happened in preceding days at the witness’s flat. But if they went solely to credibility, they were capable of adducing evidence of substantial probative value, because one factor which s 103(2)(a) makes relevant to the court’s decision about whether the evidence has “substantial probative value” within the meaning of s 103(1) is whether the evidence tended to prove that the witness knowingly made a false representation while under an obligation to tell the truth. The evidence elicited did tend to prove that – and not on some wholly unrelated occasion, but in the course of her own evidence in chief a handful of questions earlier.  
      
       
     79 While in the circumstances a person in the position of the witness might panic and choose not to tell the police what she much later said was the truth, it would have been likelier that she would have told her mother that the heroin was hers. The explanations which she gave were for the jury’s consideration in relation to issues at the heart of the case. The question about whether the mother had made a statement to the police might be objectionable, but it was not objected to and was of no prejudicial effect. 
      
       
     80 The next controversial group of questions concerns what happened at court at Port Macquarie. The leave granted was leave to ask questions about “what was said on the voir dire, or not said on the voir dire, or at a trial at Port Macquarie in May ‘99”. Some of the questioning in relation to Port Macquarie went beyond this. To some extent the questioning also assumed that the witness had complete freedom as to what she might say. Failure to disclose a matter in answer to questions at a judicial hearing might be significant if an answer to a particular question in purported compliance with a duty to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth on the subject of that question did not comply with that duty by reason of the failure. But there could be compliance with that duty even though the witness did not disclose everything she knew. The s 38 examination of the witness elicited the answer that though she was about the same distance from Luland DCJ as she was from Coolahan DCJ, she did not tell him that the heroin was hers. Whether that was significant, and whether it was within the leave granted, depended on whether she was asked a question which, had she complied with her duty, should have called for disclosure of that fact. This is a matter which could have been, and was, cleared up in cross-examination of the witness by counsel for the appellant. The witness also admitted that she had failed to tell the appellant’s solicitor or barrister that the heroin was hers (as distinct from not being the appellant’s). That was not a matter on which s 38 leave had been granted in terms. However, the questioning was relevant to the bases on which leave was granted, because the witness’s silence was inconsistent with her evidence in chief so far as she said in chief that the heroin was hers, and inconsistent with the record of interview so far as she said it was not the appellant’s. This was legitimate questioning as to credit on subjects very closely connected to both her evidence in chief and the record of interview. If it had been thought that the questioning went beyond the terms of the leave granted, an objection could have been made, but probably the only consequence would have been a widening of the terms of the leave. And again, the cross-examination by counsel for the appellant established that no lawyer appearing for either Crown or defence asked her any questions outside the court.  
      
       
     81 So far as the questioning related to events in the witness’s flat after the police arrived, it was permissible even though it may have been outside the terms of the leave. So far as it challenged the witness’s credit, it assisted the jury in deciding whether her evidence in chief about heroin possession and her statements in the record of interview about not possessing heroin, were reliable or not.  
      
       
     82 So far as the questioning concerned her grogginess on the morning of 18 July 1997, it was relevant to why she did not disclose her ownership of the heroin. The questioning tended to negate a possible explanation for the inconsistencies she was being cross-examined about. The questions about whether her explanation for the changed story was that she felt guilty about the position of the appellant, or was trying to cover up for him, were permissible. Her explanation that she changed her story because she had been tormented by conscience for years ever since 18 July 1997 was legitimately tested in view of her silence on 18 July 1997 and at Port Macquarie.  
      
       
     83 The questioning about the witness’s habit of weighing drugs for a dealer in return for being given drugs, and her use of plastic bags and scales to weigh horse food supplements, was legitimate testing of the substance of the difference between her versions, namely that on one version it was she who cut and possessed the heroin, while on the other she had no role.  
      
       
     84 So far as the appellant complained about the tone of the questioning, nothing in s 38 prevents questioning pursuant to leave granted under that section from being aggressive and confrontational. If there was any vice in particular questions, and in particular if particular questions contravened s 41, that was a matter for particular objection, and by itself no offending question could have caused any risk of a miscarriage of justice. The same is true of the questions in re-examination. 
      
       
     85 So far as the appellant complained about the absence of any basis for suggesting a motive for the changed story, there was evidence capable of supporting the motive suggested. The witness made a prior written statement in November 2000, and gave a record of interview on 20 November 2000, departing from what she had told the police on 18 July 1997. Her evidence in chief conformed to the November statements. The car was transferred into her name in January 2001. There was documentary evidence that that was the fact. At one stage the witness said that the car was not her car, but the accused’s father’s car. Then she changed her evidence and said that it was in her name, but was the accused’s father’s car. The question to which she gave the earlier answer was one which permitted her to reveal the whole truth on the point if she had then desired to do so: indeed it compelled her to. This coincidence of events, coupled with the unsatisfactory manner in which the witness gave her evidence about car ownership, supported a circumstantial inference. Whether the witness’s denial that the coincidence was significant was acceptable and whether her assertion that she only wanted to tell the truth at the trial was to be accepted were matters for the jury. The circumstances must have caused the jury to inquire why the witness had changed stories. The appellant does not now complain of the putting before the jury of the inconsistent versions. What the Crown prosecutor did was no more than to explore possible reasons why the version may have changed. Further, the fact that the appellant and Amber O’Brien changed their versions in a manner paralleling each other must have given rise to a suspicion of collusion. The Crown was entitled to rely on that. The Crown submitted to the jury that there was collusion, aided by the gift of the car. If the Crown was to make that unsurprising submission of the obvious, namely that there was collusion, and give it concreteness by reference to the car evidence, it was obliged to put that line to Amber O’Brien as a matter of fairness, as it also did in relation to the accused. In short, the whole history of the matter left it open to the jury to ask: Why have both stories changed so radically? The Crown tactics in the s 38 examination and in address were fair, rather than unfair, because they brought out into the open, for consideration by Amber O’Brien and the appellant, and exposed for the jury one possible explanation of a specific kind. 
      
       
        
       Were the questions intrinsically prejudicial? 
        
       
     86 To some extent the appellant’s argument concentrated on the form of the questions asked, without regard to the answers. The appellant submitted that where there was a witness like Amber O’Brien who was “demonstrably unreliable”, who had given “wildly inconsistent versions” of the facts in issue, and who had “some relationship” with the appellant, there was a risk of the jury being unfairly prejudiced by such questions as “you are here lying to protect him and he has given you a car to do it …”. The risk of prejudice lay in the fact of the questions because the jury might ignore a denial given in answer in view of the witness’s unreliability and friendliness to the appellant.  
      
       
     87 Section 135 and s 137 deal with prejudice. They do not control questions as such, only the evidence which may be given in answer to questions. If a question is likely to elicit an answer which is prejudicial, it may be objected to. If a question is likely to elicit an answer which is not prejudicial, it is not objectionable merely because a different answer would be prejudicial. In the s 38 examination Amber O’Brien generally gave answers which were favourable to the appellant. It is therefore hard to see that they were prejudicial, for if the jury accepted the answers the appellant’s position would be strengthened, not prejudiced. To assume, as the appellant’s argument does, that the jury would ignore answers favourable to the appellant is simply baseless speculation. It was open to the jury to reject the answers and form a correspondingly diminished opinion of her credibility. Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, that would not have been unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. It would have weakened evidence otherwise favouring him, but it would have cast light on where the truth, so far as Amber O’Brien could report it, lay. Not only was the actual evidence not unfairly prejudicial, but the questions were not either. Further, if there was any prejudice which was curable it could have been cured in the summing up; if it was incurable, the jury could have been discharged. In [103] the merits of the summing up are pointed out, together with the inferences which flow from the fact that experienced defence counsel did not seek either a redirection or a jury discharge.  
      
       
        
       The relevance of R v Hogan 
        
       
     88 R v Hogan is not a case giving any strong guidance to the answer in the present case. It is true that in that case, like this, the trial judge erred in not taking into account s 192 in deciding whether to grant leave under s 38. But the case was radically different. The consequence of leave being granted in R v Hogan apparently was that numerous additional witnesses were called and several complex side issues arose about the criminal and other misconduct of members of the Golby family. The present case, in contrast, raised quite confined issues. Amber O’Brien and the appellant agreed in their interviews with the police on 18 July 1997 that the drugs were his not hers; in her later statement, her evidence in chief, and his evidence in chief, they reversed positions and said they were hers, not his. There was no difficulty in proving the inconsistent statements which were made to the police and recorded, whereas in R v Hogan some were made to third parties. There was significant evidence against the appellant by reason of what the police observed at the flat occupied by him and Amber O’Brien. The controversy was a confined one. An investigation of why Amber O’Brien might change her story was neither irrelevant nor excessively prejudicial. In short, as discussed in [75] above, this was a case where the credibility of Amber O’Brien and the issue of whether it was she or the accused who was guilty were closely entwined. 
      
       
     89 The aspect of R v Hogan on which the appellant relies is the allowing of the appeal on the ground that the application of s 38 caused the focus of the trial to shift from the issue whether the appellant was guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to the issue of whether Rachel Golby was lying to protect the appellant. Here the issue of the appellant’s guilt and the witness’s allegedly lying evidence in chief were much more closely linked. If she was telling the truth on oath, he was innocent. If she was lying on oath but telling the truth on 18 July 1997, he was not innocent. Whether she was lying was an issue partly turning on whether she had a motive to.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     90 Had the trial judge approached the questions properly, even if objections had been taken by counsel for the appellant appearing at the trial conforming with those which counsel appearing for him on the appeal said should have been taken, he would have ended up permitting questioning substantially to the effect of that which in fact took place (omitting a handful of excessively offensive or vague questions of no significance). In particular, he could legitimately, and would, have reached the following conclusions. Section 38 permits the testing of the evidence in chief with a view to establishing the probability of the truth of the matters asserted in the prior inconsistent statement. Hence it permits examination of the witness on matters of credit with a view to the jury accepting the prior inconsistent statement and rejecting the later sworn evidence. It also permits an examination of the background at the time with which the statements are dealing, the background at the time when the prior inconsistent statement is made, and the background at the time when the witness moves to a version different from the prior inconsistent statement. It permits an inquiry into the possible reasons for the change, including the motives for the change. Judicial rulings which prevented these techniques being employed where application is made for leave to question under s 38 would not be giving full effect to the section. Hence the failure of the trial judge to take account of s 192 or s 135 or s 137 is immaterial. So is the fact that the trial judge did not grant the leave in small, precisely defined segments. So is the possible extent to which the questions asked went beyond the leave actually given, for they were within the leave which could have been given. Independently of whether the parties raise the question, account must always be taken of s 192 and, in criminal cases, of s 137. In practice account will usually also be taken of s 135, though in criminal cases its operation overlaps very significantly with that of s 137. If leave is granted under s 38, the recipient should not go beyond it without a further application for leave. In these last-mentioned respects the trial did not proceed satisfactorily, doubtless because the trial judge received no assistance from the parties in these respects. The different proposition advanced by the appellant that trial judges should grant leave in small precisely defined segments may apply validly in some cases. Indeed some support for a limited version of the appellant’s approach appears in R v Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292 at [80]-[81]. But it has not been demonstrated that that approach is a sound criticism of the trial judge in the present case. However, whether the trial judge was technically open to criticism or not for the way in which the s 38 questioning was allowed and prosecuted, in my opinion no unfairness arose as a result of what happened. 
      
       
     91 Accordingly Grounds 1 and 2 fail.  
      
       
     92 The issues underlying Grounds 1 and 2 overlap with those underlying Ground 3. The actual evidence about the registration of the vehicle in Amber O’Brien’s name comprises her admission that it was transferred to her on 10 January 2001 (in contrast to her denial during the s 38 examination that the car was hers); and a RTA transfer document evidencing the transfer of the vehicle into her name on that day. Neither item of evidence was objected to. The first item of evidence was objectionable on grounds of form (it was in answer to a question in re-examination which was leading and which did not arise from cross-examination). It was not, however, irrelevant, because Amber O’Brien’s motives to lie were relevant. Nor was it vulnerable to exclusion under s 135 or inadmissible under s 137, because its probative value, in demonstrating a material reason to change her story, exceeded its prejudicial effect.  
      
       
     93 Accordingly Ground 3 fails as well. 
      
       
        
       Proviso 
        
       
     94 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that even if the trial judge erred, the appeal may be dismissed on the ground that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. According to authorities conveniently collected in Glennon v R (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712, the proviso cannot be applied in two circumstances. One is where the error is so fundamental that it caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all. That is not the case here. The other is if the conviction is not “inevitable” in the sense that the appellant can be said to have lost a chance of acquittal which was fairly open.  
      
       
     95 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the jury disbelieved him because at least partially they thought he might have transferred a vehicle in the witness’s name, or otherwise told a lie on his behalf, that was such a substantial inroad into his credit that he lost a reasonable opportunity to be acquitted. People often make confessions to police and get acquitted. 
         
        
        
         
         Without the confession all the evidence showed was that there was a quantity of drugs in the house occupied by four people, two of whom seemed to be the likely suspects, one was the accused and the other was the witness. The Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt it was in his possession or jointly in his possession with the witness. They had to exclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was in the witness’s possession exclusively. Anything which substantially undermined his credit, and improperly so, contrary to law, meant that he lost a reasonable chance of acquittal.” 
         
        
       
     96 The appellant’s case on the appeal was not put in any uniform way. The submissions to the effect that there was an error of law in the way the trial judge approached the exercise of discretion under s 38 were sound, but in applying the proviso the question is what error the trial judge made in the substance of his conclusions, not what error was made en route to them. Some of the appellant’s submissions about the substance of the trial judge’s conclusions were radical. Moving from the most radical position to the least, they were: 
      
       
        
       (a) Amber O’Brien should never have been called. 
        
        
       (b) Section 38 questioning of Amber O’Brien should never have been permitted. 
        
        
       (c) Section 38 questioning of Amber O’Brien should never have been permitted as to credit. 
        
        
       (d) Section 38 questioning of Amber O’Brien should never have been permitted except by degrees after limited applications were made in succession: first as to precisely identified inconsistent statements, then as to the particular circumstances of each statement, and then as to motives for the differences in her statements. 
        
        
       (e) Questioning of Amber O’Brien on the basis that she had a motive to cover up the appellant’s role in the crime, and that that motive was gaining the vehicle, should never have been permitted.  
        
       
     97 The decision whether the proviso to s 6(1) applies must turn on identifying the error allegedly made by the trial judge. 
      
       
     98 If the error related to permitting her to be called or permitting her to be examined under s 38, then conviction was not inevitable. But the appellant did not advance any ground of appeal in relation to the trial judge’s having permitted her to be called, and the appellant conceded that some form of leave in the first instance was not erroneous. 
      
       
     99 If the error lay in permitting her to be cross-examined as to credit, it cannot be said that the conviction was inevitable. But the submission by the appellant that that was an error was far from powerful. 
      
       
     100 If the error lay in not requiring that there be a series of s 38 applications, each precisely defined and subject to specific conditions, it is likely that the Crown would eventually have got leave having the same extent which it actually achieved after one application. Subject to the remaining points, a conviction obtained after that piecemeal process would have been inevitable.  
      
       
     101 If the error lay in granting leave for s 38 questioning, or permitting questioning beyond the bounds of s 38 leave, directed to a motive of protecting the accused, and a motive centred on a bargain by which the witness was to get a vehicle for changing her story, the question is whether without that type of examination a conviction would have been inevitable.  
      
       
     102 There are several matters relevant to that question.  
      
       
     103 First, the trial judge said the following about Amber O’Brien’s evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, members of the jury, so far as her evidence is concerned, she was called by the prosecution but she gave evidence which was unfavourable to the prosecution case. The prosecution was therefore allowed to cross-examine her to show that she had earlier made a statement which was inconsistent with the evidence that she gave here in this Court.  
         
        
        
         
         That earlier statement, in the form of a record of interview made on 18 July 1997, is not before you but you have heard evidence from Ms O’Brien confirming that passages of that statement read out to her by the learned Crown Advocate were true in the sense that that is what she told the police at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Of course, in nearly all respects, what she admitted in evidence saying to the police on 18 July 1997 about the ownership of these drugs was diametrically opposed to what she said in the witness box in this trial. You must decide in this case, in view of those conflicts, whether you accept the evidence given in the trial or you accept what Ms O’Brien conceded that she had earlier told the police on 18 July 1997. On the other hand, in view of those conflicts you have to decide whether you accept the evidence of Ms O’Brien altogether.  
         
        
        
         
         In respect to both the earlier statement made by her and the evidence that she gave in this Court, I should warn you that the earlier statement may be unreliable and so might the evidence that she gave in this Court. The reasons for that are that when she made the earlier statement she was a suspect in the proceedings; she was a juvenile – I think the evidence is that she was sixteen – who had no criminal record; and she said that she had been told by police that the accused had admitted that the drug was his and that she should back him up. She also gave evidence that she was scared. 
         
        
        
         
         They are matters, if you accept them, that may lead to her earlier statement being unreliable. Whether you find that it is unreliable or not is totally a matter for you, and the weight you attach to those matters, or the importance you attach to them, is also a matter for you. 
         
        
        
         
         Likewise, the evidence that she gave in this trial may be unreliable because of the previous inconsistent statement that she had made to the police on 18 July 1997. Again, whether you find that her evidence in this trial is unreliable or not is a matter for you. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown, of course, says, look, you would have no doubt but that what Ms O’Brien told the police in her recorded interview on 18 July 1997 was the truth and that what she is telling you in the witness box now is not the truth and it is part of an elaborate scheme to ensure that the accused is acquitted. The Crown points to the fact that, whilst she says that the relationship with the accused ended some two months after their arrest, it is clear that there is still a relationship of some sort going on. She gave evidence about her brother being looked after by her and she said that the accused came and visited, as did the accused say that, and there was the question of the car which she said belonged to the accused’s father being registered in her name late last year. The Crown points to those matters as being evidence, if you accept if, of the fact that she could not be said to be an impartial witness. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, Mr McColm says, well, you have got to bear in mind that back in July 1997, Amber O’Brien was only sixteen years of age. But, more importantly, she has made a statement in November last year and participated in an interview in which she inculpates herself in relation to serious drug offences, and she received legal advice and she knows by doing that that she could receive a custodial sentence – be charged and receive a custodial sentence. And Mr McColm says, well, how likely is that, unless it was true? 
         
        
        
         
         Again, members of the jury, they are matters for you to take into account when you come to assess Ms O’Brien’s evidence. The Crown, of course, points to the fact that it was only in November of last year that this allegation by Ms O’Brien that the drug was hers first came to light. Mr McColm says, well, you have got to take into account her age at the time; her evidence that it was on her mind, in the sense that she felt guilty about it, until it got to the stage where she knew she could not go on experiencing that guilt, and confessed that the drug was hers. 
         
        
        
         
         He also points to the fact that she was under no obligation at any stage to inform anyone, or to inculpate herself, I should say, in relation to what she says was her possession of this drug. 
         
        
        
         
         Members of the jury, they are the matters that, in brief, relate to the evidence of Amber O’Brien. Can I just say this to you, and I express no view one way or the other, that if you were to reject the evidence of Amber O’Brien, then that does not, of course, mean that the accused is automatically guilty. You still have to take into account all the other evidence in the case. …” 
         
        
        
       That is, the trial judge was warning the jury that a finding that Amber O’Brien’s sworn evidence was unacceptable, even dishonest, did not mean that its converse was true. It did not follow from a rejection of her evidence that the drugs were the appellant’s. No further direction was sought with a view to overcoming any inadequacy perceived at the time by defence counsel. It may safely be inferred that in the atmosphere of the trial after that direction had been given defence counsel saw no prejudice flowing to his client from the handling of Amber O’Brien by the Crown. The appellant complained that the jury were not told that there was no evidence that the appellant had instigated Amber O’Brien to give false evidence in his favour: but it would not have been true for the trial judge to have said that, because there was circumstantial evidence capable of supporting that conclusion, and whether it did was a matter of what inferences the jury felt it should draw. The appellant submitted that all the damage had been done by the time of the summing up and was incapable of correction by it; in that case one would have expected defence counsel to have perceived this and to have asked for the jury to be discharged. This did not happen, and it is obvious why it did not happen. 
        
       
     104 Secondly, Amber O’Brien gave sworn evidence which was potentially very damaging to the appellant. Near the end of the s 38 examination, the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The heroin that was found that you say is yours, that was a very pure substance wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah it was pretty good, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the purpose of the purity was that it was to be cut down to a street weight, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No we never used to cut it no.” 
         
        
       
     105 It was open to the jury to treat that as evidence that the very heroin which had been found on 18 July 1997 and which she claimed ownership of in her evidence in chief was heroin which she and the appellant had been habitually having access to, not for cutting to the street weight, but for their own purposes. The answers were capable of permitting the jury to infer joint possession of the heroin, which would have sufficed to render the appellant guilty as charged. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the word “it” did not refer to the drug seized, but to other drugs used in the more remote past. That submission collides with the identification of what the heroin was in the first question. 
      
       
     106 Thirdly, the Crown case was strong from several points of view.  
      
       
     107 The heroin was found in premises occupied by the appellant. Resealable bags and precision scales were found in the appellant’s bedroom. There was no suggestion that the drugs were possessed by anyone other than either the appellant or Amber O’Brien or both. No suggestion was made that the police officers had planted the drugs, least of all to the police officers. 
      
       
     108 There were admissions by conduct, or items of circumstantial evidence, strongly adverse to the appellant: he broke away from the police officers, including Detective Richards, soon after their arrival, ran to the toilet and flushed it; he then lied to Detective Richards about whether he had been with Detective Richards when the toilet had been flushed; and though the appellant was “relaxed …, very cocky and … quite assured” while his bedroom was being searched, when he was brought to have a look at the ball with rubber bands around it which was found in the toilet and which contained heroin, his demeanour changed: “He became quite depressed, he was calling out to Amber requesting her to come to him. He was very emotional”.  
      
       
     109 If the effect of the appellant’s admissions in the course of the record of interview were to be overcome, the jury had to disbelieve numerous police officers, or at least not accept their evidence. There was no particular reason to disbelieve or not accept the evidence of any of them. So far as events at the appellant’s townhouse were concerned, one issue was whether the appellant ran up the stairs to the toilet (as Detective Richards and Sergeant Sainsbury said they saw him do, and as Detective Senior Constable Johnston said he heard), or merely took a step or two to the toilet on reaching the top of the stairs (as the appellant said); and whether the appellant flushed the toilet (as Detective Richards and Sergeant Sainsbury said they saw, and as Detective Senior Constable Johnston and Sergeant Loughland said they heard) or not. The appellant’s version did not explain how it was that the police came to find the drugs in the toilet. So far as events in the police car as it took the appellant on the short journey from his townhouse to the police station were concerned, the issue was whether the police were silent or whether they told the appellant that if he did not confess, both he and Amber O’Brien would be charged and gaoled. The appellant’s evidence in chief twice specifically located this threat as having taken place in the car on the way from his house to the police station: he said there were three officers present. In cross-examination Detective Richards denied saying anything like this “before the interview”: he was not asked about where he was supposed to have said it. Detective Lysaght, who was in the car as the driver, was not asked in cross-examination about it; yet if the threat had been made, he would have heard it. It was not put to Detective Sergeant Johnston that the threat was made during the car journey by Detective Richards, only that Detective Richards made it “before” the interview. He denied that. Though it was open to the jury to think that these disparities arose from some fault on the part of counsel, it was also open to them to conclude that the failure of counsel for the appellant to cross-examine Detective Lysaght at all and the disparity between the version put to Detectives Richards and Johnston in cross-examination and the version given by the appellant in chief strengthened Detective Richards’ and Detective Johnston’s denials and weakened the appellant’s credibility. (In his remarks on sentence the trial judge said: “There were three police officers in the car at the relevant time and each denied that this threat was ever made”: as indicated, two denied it was ever made, and were not asked about the car: the other was not asked at all.) The appellant’s position was further weakened by his admission that at Port Macquarie he said that Detective Richards’ alleged threat was at the police station just before the interview, not in the police car. He also admitted giving false evidence at Port Macquarie about whether Amber O’Brien was still his girlfriend.  
      
       
     110 Fourthly, Amber O’Brien’s evidence in chief and her overall position in the witness box were unconvincing. The drugs were worth $7,000. She did not explain convincingly why she, a girl of 17, would be given drugs of that value. She said she got them from her father’s best friend, sold heroin and gave the money to the friend. She also said she put the heroin in the toilet on the night of 17 July 1997. She attributed to police officers statements purporting to explain her allegedly false claim of innocence on 18 July 1997 for which there is no evidentiary support. Indeed it is significant that the instructions of the appellant’s counsel in cross-examining the police appeared to differ from her evidence, despite the fact that the terms of his leading questions to her in cross-examination appeared to reveal a familiarity with, and an expectation of, what she was going to say. She said that among the reasons why she did not tell the police the truth on 18 July 1997 was the fact that “they” told her that the appellant had already confessed. Her interview on 18 July 1997 was conducted by a Detective Acting Sergeant Bryant and Sergeant Loughland. Detective Acting Sergeant Bryant was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Before you interviewed Miss O’Brien did you say, or did you hear another officer say, to her that the accused had admitted the heroin to being his? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t recall. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. See did either you say, or hear another officer say to Miss O’Brien, that the accused had said it was for his personal use, both for him and herself? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t recall that either. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did either you say or hear another officer say that the accused had said this because at least one had to be charged and the accused didn’t want it to be her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That I would definitely remember and no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did either you or another officer say to Miss O’Brien that she had to do an interview? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And if she didn’t she’d be charged anyway? 
         
        
        
         
         A No not at all. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And was there any suggestion made that she should back up Ian’s story? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it suggested to her that if she backed up Ian’s story she would be home that night? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. See I suggest that all occurred before the interview was commenced with Miss O’Brien. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No that’s not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But of course you weren’t with Miss O’Brien, as you fairly said, the whole time she was at the police station? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And indeed you weren’t present when she was arrested? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct.” 
         
        
       
     111 Sergeant Loughland said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Before you conducted, or before the interview was conducted with Ms O’Brien, she was told that the accused had admitted that the heroin was his? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Not that I recall, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Had she been told what the accused had said at all? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Not that I recall, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I mean, you had information that the accused said it was his, hadn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know what the exact conversation was, but yeah, that’s my understanding, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And it was of concern to find out what Ms O’Brien might say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. About that and other matters as well, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say this to Ms O’Brien, or did Detective Bryant say this to Ms O’Brien in your presence, that the accused had admitted the heroin being his and that he had had it for personal use? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t recall that, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you or Detective Bryant say to Ms O’Brien that the accused had said – had told the police he smokes five grams a day and that she, Amber, smoked three? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Sorry, could you repeat that? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you or Detective Bryant say something to this effect to Ms O’Brien, that the accused had said he smoked five grams a day and that she smoked three? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, that’s not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did either of you, I mean Bryant or yourself, say to Ms O’Brien that the accused had said this because at least one had to be charged and Ian, the accused, didn’t want it to be her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did either of you say to Ms O’Brien that she had to do an interview and if she didn’t, they would charge her anyway? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s definitely not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was she told, either by yourself or Bryant, that if she didn’t want to get charged and go straight to gaol, she should back up Ian’s story? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s definitely not correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did either of you say to Ms O’Brien that she and the accused would be – both would be at home that night if she made a statement? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
        
       There was much material put in those leading questions of which Amber O’Brien said nothing in her evidence. While it was open to the jury to consider that these disparities arose from a mistake by counsel or some momentary loss of memory by Amber O’Brien, it was also open to the jury to infer that while she may have given instructions to support the questions, she was not prepared to adhere to those instructions on oath. 
        
       
     112 Thus the appellant’s submission that without the appellant’s confession the evidence showed only that there were drugs in a house occupied by four people is quite invalid. There was Amber O’Brien’s sworn statement pointing to the habitual joint use of drugs. There was suspicious behaviour on the part of the appellant in running away from the police, flushing the toilet and then lying about it. There was a significant change in the appellant’s demeanour when the drugs were found in the toilet. There was questioning by the appellant’s counsel of the police officers in relation to Detective Richards’ alleged threat indicative of uncertain instructions from the appellant in which the appellant’s counsel had no confidence. There was a change of story by the appellant in relation to that threat. There was the appellant’s false evidence at Port Macquarie about Amber O’Brien’s status. And, if Amber O’Brien’s evidence in chief is held out as a prop for the appellant’s case, there was much in her evidence to raise grave doubts about it.  
      
       
     113 Each individual item of evidence against the appellant is capable of innocent explanation in some way. When they are taken together, the possibility of them bearing an innocent explanation dissolves to the point of invisibility.  
      
       
     114 In all the circumstances there were very substantial materials which the jury could employ to criticise the credibility of the appellant’s testimony and accept the credibility of his interview on 18 July 1997, and also to reject the credibility of Amber O’Brien’s testimony. 
      
       
     115 Even if it is concluded that questioning about motives, and about the car, for some reason should not have been permitted, there were very grave doubts about the credibility of both Amber O’Brien and the appellant. Even without any questioning about motives, the jury would reasonably have asked themselves why such radical reversals of position had taken place. There must have been some motive for Amber O’Brien’s change of tack. It would have been likely that the jury attended to the facts that she had escaped being prosecuted while the appellant had not; that he had much to gain by changing his story at the trial while she may have thought she had nothing to lose; and that she had only changed her story at a late stage, November 2000. The precise nature of her motive would not have altered the inevitability of the appellant’s conviction.  
      
       
     116 Accordingly, even if any of the grounds of appeal were made out, in my opinion the proviso ought to be applied.  
      
       
        
       The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     117 Counsel for the appellant advanced the following points.  
      
       
     118 First, three factual errors were pointed to. The appellant was 19 when the offence was committed; yet the trial judge said he was 21. This mistake was said to be significant because a 19 year old, unlike a 21 year old, was not necessarily to be regarded as having reached adult standards of responsibility. Secondly, the trial judge said that the offence took place on 18 July 2000, when in fact it took place on 18 July 1997. This, it was said, led the trial judge to underestimate the length of the appellant’s period free of crime by three years, and hence erroneously discounted a significant matter in mitigation. A third factual error was that the trial judge said the quantity was 34.7 grams. Though the Crown had this error corrected, the sentence was pronounced immediately after the correction. 
      
       
     119 Dealing with these points in turn, the first is unconvincing because 19 year olds are expected to conform to the standards of responsibility imposed by the criminal law on older persons. There is no reason to suppose that the second error is anything other than an inconsequential typographical error. That is suggested by the fact that the trial judge stated the correct date a little later on that page. The same is true of the third error: the trial judge stated the correct weight while describing what the police found in the toilet seat. Hence it is not the case that he was operating under a complete misapprehension until the Crown intervened at the end of his reasons. And even if, which has not been demonstrated, the error as to the weight was operative on the trial judge’s decision to select the sentence he did, it does not follow that he was wrong. The actual weight was not trivial, and as counsel for the appellant conceded, weight is not the only relevant factor.  
      
       
     120 Counsel for the appellant also relied on the fact that the appellant had no prior convictions of the kind of crime charged, on the fact that the conviction was for deemed supply rather than actual trafficking, on the fact that there was no evidence that the appellant intended to make a profit, on the fact that the sentence placed the appellant in the top 20% or 30% of offenders, and on the fact that home detention, an available option given the appellant’s age and the 3½ years since the crime, was a reasonable option, but it was not considered. The appellant submitted that, given the trial judge’s finding of special circumstances, both head sentence and non-parole period should be reduced.  
      
       
     121 The failure to consider home detention is evidently not regarded by the appellant as a decisive matter, since the application is not that a sentence of home detention should be substituted. That perception on the appellant’s part is understandable, since there is no suggestion that the sentencing judge was asked to consider home detention. The good record of the appellant in relation to serious drug offences is not matched by a good record in other respects, including as it does offences in three States for crimes against property, crimes against the person, drug crimes and attempted escaping from lawful custody. The sentencing judge did find that the indicia of actual supply (resealable plastic bags and a sensitive set of scales) pointed to the supply of heroin in fact. The amount of the drug seized was significant, being worth about $7,000. So far as the appellant relies on Judicial Commission statistics, they are of limited utility. Statistical averaging glosses over the inevitable variations in circumstances, objective and subjective: R v Hofer [2001] NSWCCA 554 at [23]. Further, as Grove J said with Howie J’s concurrence in R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 410 at [14]-[15]: 
      
       
        
         
         “there is a misconception that the upper limit of the range of sentence is that of the statistical publications of sentence information by the Judicial Commission. Such statistics were apparently available to the applicant and indeed have been attached to Crown submissions. 
         
        
        
         
         The upper limit of sentence is in fact the maximum set by parliament. If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offenders then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure. This is not a matter of jurisprudence but a matter of arithmetic.” 
         
        
       
     122 In my opinion there is no error of principle, no material error of fact, no failure to consider any relevant circumstance, and no taking into account of any irrelevant circumstance in the sentencing judge’s reasoning. Counsel for the appellant described the sentence as being in all the circumstances “very harsh”. It was not so harsh as to go beyond the legitimate bounds of the sentencing judge’s discretion. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     123 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       (1) The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
        
       (2) The application for leave to appeal against sentence is dismissed. 
        
       
     124 DUNFORD J: I agree. 
      
       
     125 BUDDIN J: I agree with Heydon JA.

       Introduction 
        
       
     2 This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed on the respondent by Judge Andrews in the Dubbo District Court on 17 August 2001. The respondent had pleaded guilty to an offence of Dangerous Driving Occasioning Death (s 52A(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900) and Dangerous Driving Occasioning Grievous Bodily Harm (s 52A(3)(c)). 
      
       
     3 The sentence imposed on the respondent for the most serious offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, was a term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 17 August 2001 and expire on 16 August 2003. The sentence was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. With respect to the second offence, the sentence passed was for a term of 18 months imprisonment, concurrent with the first sentence, and that sentence was also suspended. 
      
       
     4 The foundation for the appellant’s case is the submission that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. Three errors are alleged. First, that his Honour made an erroneous assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. Secondly, that his Honour elided the two steps required when imposing a suspended sentence. Lastly, that his Honour made an erroneous assessment of the weight to be given to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. 
      
       
     5 Before turning to the facts of the motor vehicle accident which is the subject of the offences, it is convenient to set forth some relevant dates and circumstances. 
      
       
     6 The accident occurred on 20 July 2000 when the respondent was 17 years and 3 months old. He had had a provisional driver’s licence for 6 weeks and was driving home from part-time work in Dubbo late at night and alone. 
      
       
     7 The respondent was charged and appeared in Dubbo Local Court on 28 February 2001 when the presiding magistrate referred the case to the Children’s Court on 7 March 2001. On this date the respondent entered pleas of guilty and the case was adjourned to 18 June 2001 for sentence. However, on that date a different magistrate committed the respondent to the District Court for sentence. This occurred on 17 August 2001 before his Honour Judge Andrews. 
      
       
     8 On 31 August 2001 the Director advised the respondent that the Offices was considering whether to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It appears that some time in late November 2001 the Legal Aid Commission intimated to the respondent that it understood that an appeal had been filed. However, the respondent was not served with the Notice of Appeal until 2 April 2002 thus there was a delay of 7 months before the respondent was served. This is a significant delay in the circumstances of a non-custodial sentence and the explanation for the late service of the Notice of Appeal which has been proffered is not a very satisfactory one. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     9 I turn to the essential facts of the accident as found by his Honour. It is convenient to quote sections from his Honour’s reasons on sentence. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         At about 11.45pm on 20 July 2000 the young person was driving a 1987 Ford Falcon station sedan, registration QFC 411, in an easterly direction on the Golden Highway towards Dunedoo and approximately ten kilometres east of Dubbo he has attempted to overtake a truck which was being driven by the witness O’Sullivan. He attempted to overtake on an uphill section of roadway and in doing so crossed double unbroken separation lines near the crest of a hill. At the time the victims Peter and Lydia So were travelling in a 1995 Toyota Camry sedan, registration number QLY 888 which Peter So was driving in a westerly direction and which has crested the hill and a head [-on] collision has occurred between the two vehicles. 
         
        
        
         
         This collision occurred wholly on the incorrect side of the road for the direction of travel of the young person’s vehicle. As a result of the collision Lydia So who was a passenger in the front seat suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at Dubbo Base hospital. The driver of the truck had stopped and contacted police and ambulance who have attended a short time later. The young person was also conveyed to Dubbo Base hospital as was Peter So who was trapped in the vehicle for a short time after the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         The highway was blocked for approximately three hours. As a result of the collision the victim Peter So suffered multiple rib fractures, fractured a right femur, right tibula, multiple fractures to the right ankle, lacerations to the left knee, multiple fractures to the left ankle and bruising to one of his lungs causing breathing difficulties. 
         
        
        
         
         The young person suffered facial injuries which required surgery for correction and is also receiving ongoing treatment as is Mr So.  
         
        
       
     10 In considering the objective seriousness of the offences his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         … there is no dispute that the road was bitumen, it was dry and the weather was clear. Visibility was described as reasonably good due to the moonlight. The speed limit was 100 kilometres per hour. The prisoner passed one vehicle prior to the accident probably a few kilometres beforehand. The driver of the overtaken vehicle said that she was travelling about 60 kilometres per hour and the prisoner’s vehicle passed her quickly. The truck which the prisoner attempted to overtake consisted of a prime mover and a single trailer which was loaded with wheat. The driver of the truck said that he was travelling about 95 to 97 kilometres per hour as he went up the hill to where the accident happened. He was travelling at about 90 kilometres per hour near the top of the hill. He said that the prisoner’s vehicle pulled out onto the incorrect side of the road and at that time there were double lines and he was approaching the crest of the hill. The prisoner cannot shed any light on the matter as he has now has no recollection of the accident due to the injuries which he suffered. 
         
        
        
         
         He was at this time a school boy. He was working in Dubbo at night at a Kentucky Fried Chicken shop. He was travelling home in his father’s car as they lived about 42 kilometres out of Dubbo on the Dunedoo Road. He had a provisional licence for six weeks which meant that he could not exceed 80 kilometres per hour. He had driven this route a few times before at night. Given the speed of the truck which he was overtaking, it was apparent that he was driving somewhat in excess of 90 kilometres per hour at the time of the accident, although I cannot make a finding necessarily that he was exceeding the speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour.  
         
        
       
     11 It will be noted from this extract that the sentencing judge’s reasons that his Honour found that the speed of the respondent was in excess of 90 kph at the time of the accident but not in excess of the 100 kph speed limit. 
      
       
     12 His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         I note from the photographic evidence and other evidence that it is a comparatively short distance from the commencement of the double unbroken line to the scene of the accident. Given that distance and the speed of the truck which was around 90 kilometres per hour and the speed of the prisoner’s vehicle, I am not necessarily convinced that the prisoner pulled out to overtake after the commencement of the double unbroken lines. It may be that he commenced to overtake when there was an unbroken line and that either due to the presence of a large truck in front of him and due to inexperience he made an error of judgment which meant that he was across the double unbroken line and on the incorrect side of the road and near to the crest of the hill at the time of impact.  
         
        
       
     13 One feature of the roadway referred to by his Honour was the widening of the road from two lanes to four from the commencement of the centre unbroken line. His Honour said that this could possibly have given the impression to an inexperienced driver at night of the road opening up to four lanes. I would have thought, judging by the photographic exhibits, that the purpose of the widening of the road was to allow slow vehicles, such as trucks, to move over to the new left lane on climbing the hill. The driver of the wheat truck did not do this. 
      
       
     14 The other matter which I mention is that it is my understanding that the maximum speed permissible for a provisional driver is 90 kph and not 80 kph referred to by his Honour and which seems to have been assumed by all concerned in the District Court. During argument on the appeal, it has been conceded that the position is that a provisional driver, such as the respondent, is restricted to a maximum speed of 90 kph by reason of his provisional licence. However, this error probably matters not. 
      
       
     15 His Honour recorded that alcohol was not a factor in the accident and that neither excessive speed not erratic driving was involved. Rather, the respondent made an error of judgment. His Honour said it was ‘certainly greater than momentary inattention’. Rather, his Honour thought that it was something more, given the respondent’s deliberate decision to overtake. His Honour said that it was a misjudgment based on inexperience. Serious as it was, it could not in his view be categorised as an abandonment of responsibility. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         I would assess the objective gravity of the offence as greater than momentary misjudgment, but closer to that level of culpability than to an abandonment of responsibility.  
         
        
       
     16 After reference to the respondent’s subjective circumstances, his Honour concluded as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         By taking all of these matters into consideration I consider that the objective seriousness of the offence being greater than momentary misjudgment means that a sentence of full time custody is warranted. But as the conduct is considerably less than reaching the threshold of abandoning responsibility and in view of the youth of the prisoner and in light of all of the subjective matters outlined, I propose in all of these circumstances to suspend those sentences.  
         
        
        
       Abandonment of responsibility 
        
       
     17 It is the appellant’s submission that, properly categorised, the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. In so submitting, the appellant challenges his Honour’s findings that excessive speed and erratic driving were not relevant factors. 
      
       
     18 However, given the evidence before the court, I am unable to see how his Honour’s findings on speed and erratic driving were not findings which were open to him to make on the evidence. It would be a brave appellate court which intervened and rejected findings of fact available on the evidence. Here there are no particular features which are apparent in the evidence to lead me to conclude that his Honour’s factual findings should be overturned. 
      
       
     19 His Honour found that the respondent was driving in excess of the speed which he was permitted to drive with a provisional licence but not above the speed limit of 100 kph. I would not understand that such a ‘degree of speed’, as explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231, would indicate that the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. The same comment may also be made about the allegation of ‘erratic driving’. 
      
       
     20 As his Honour the sentencing judge said, what caused the accident was an error of judgment due to inexperience. Nonetheless, it was in my opinion, a fairly massive error of judgment. It had devastating and tragic consequences. To pull over onto the incorrect side of the road to overtake a truck while approaching the crest of a hill where he could not see over the hill, was a major error, even if caused by inexperience. But can it amount, of itself, to an indication of abandonment of responsibility? In the circumstances of this case, and without excessive speed, erratic driving or other indicia, I do not think that it can so qualify. Interestingly enough, such driving is not specifically included in the list of factors collected by the Chief Justice in Jurisic as circumstances of aggravation which may indicate an abandonment of responsibility. I accept, of course, that other circumstances may qualify and it is the circumstances in the context in which the particular conduct occurs which are relevant. 
      
       
     21 Counsel for the respondent made the point that while the consequences of his client’s actions were grave in the extreme, his moral culpability was low. He was not drunk or affected by drugs, he was not showing off or travelling at a grossly excessive speed. He was not driving whilst tired but driving home from work after he concluded his part-time job. In attempting to overtake the truck he made an error of judgment as to how long it would take him to safely complete the manoeuvre. 
      
       
     22 In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to find that the respondent did not abandon responsibility for his conduct. Nor do I accept the appellant’s submission that the driving of the respondent was very close to an abandonment of responsibility, rather than where it seems his Honour located the respondent’s conduct on the continuum. 
      
       
        
       Eliding the two steps 
        
       
     23 It is the appellant’s submission that, having first determined that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence, the court must determine the length of the sentence. It is only after this step that the court considers the manner in which the term is to be served. It is submitted that his Honour elided the steps. Reliance is placed on Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 and R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 
      
       
     24 It is not evident to me that his Honour necessarily elided the steps. It would, of course, have been clearer if his Honour had said that he chose a two year term of imprisonment independently of the criteria for suspension.  
      
       
     25 I do not accept the submission that if his Honour had set the term of imprisonment consistent with the objective seriousness without regard to whether it should be suspended, he would have assessed a custodial term significantly below a 2 year term. In my view, a two year term of imprisonment was justified on his Honour’s findings. It may be noted that a somewhat similar argument was rejected by the court in R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50] to [54]. 
      
       
        
       Weight to be given to subjective circumstances 
        
       
     26 It is submitted by the appellant that his Honour gave too much weight to the youth and prior good character of the respondent. Reliance is placed on remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Musumeci (Unreported, NSWCCA, 30 October 1997) referred to by the Chief Justice in Jurisic [at 228]. In particular, that the youth of the offender should be given less weight than in other types of cases. Also, that so far as youthful offenders of good character are guilty of dangerous driving, the sentence must be seen as having a reasonable proportionality to the objective factors and inadequate weight should not be given to those objective factors. 
      
       
     27 I do not conclude that his Honour gave too much weight to the youth of the respondent or to his previous good character. Nor did his Honour lose sight of a reasonable proportionality with the objective facts as he found them. The character evidence concerning the respondent was very strong and could not be ignored. 
      
       
     28 It follows from the above that I am not persuaded that his Honour made any error in the sentences which he imposed on the respondent.  
      
       
     29 Insofar as the appellant submits that the suspension of the sentences led to a manifestly inadequate sentence being imposed, I do not accept this submission. On the facts as found by the sentencing judge which were open to him, the plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity and the subjective features, the sentence imposed was within the permissible range.  
      
       
     30 It may be noted that his Honour did not have periodic detention availability to him as a sentencing option since there is no facility in the Dubbo area. 
      
       
        
       Discretion and Delay, Double Jeopardy 
        
       
     31 While I am not satisfied of error by the sentencing judge, even if there was error, it would not in my view be appropriate for the court to intervene and resentence the respondent. 
      
       
     32 First, there was a considerable delay by the appellant in serving the Notice of Appeal, which I have already referred to. As I mentioned, it was not served until 2 April 2002, some 7 ½ months after the sentence was passed. The explanation for this delay is far from convincing. However, it appears from what we were told by counsel for the respondent at the hearing of the appeal, that the Legal Aid Commission told the respondent in mid to late November that it was aware that the Director had lodged an appeal, thus there was a delay in him being aware of the appeal of around 3 months. Gleeson CJ in R v Astill (Unreported, NSWCCA, 29 January 1990) stressed the need for prompt notification of an appeal by the Crown. In that case the delay was around 2 months.  
      
       
     33 A number of other cases have been referred to by counsel for the respondent including R v Myers (Unreported, NSWCCA, 13 February 1990) in which the delay was around 3 months; R v Hallacoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67, where the delay was 2 ½ months; and R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, where the delay was around 2 months. Delay is in my opinion a powerful discretionary factor and it must be kept firmly in mind that the delay is in fact to be measured from 20 July 200 when the accident occurred. I have already referred to the steps taken along the way in the processing of this case. 
      
       
     34 The delay which I have referred to above must also be viewed together with the element of double jeopardy, which is particularly important and onerous where a non-custodial sentence is passed at first instance. Given that the respondent was a juvenile at the time of offence, the case was at one stage to be dealt with at the Children’s Court. However, this did not come to pass. 
      
       
     35 It has now been over 9 months since the sentences were imposed and getting on for two years since the accident. The accumulation of delays have also had consequences for the respondent, as the evidence demonstrates. There is also evidence before the court of events in the respondent’s life since the sentence was passed, his continued remorse as well as his further good works in the community. 
      
       
     36 Given the element of double jeopardy and the extensive delays in the process, which have not in any way been contributed to by the respondent, if there be error I do not believe that this court should intervene. Rather it should dismiss the appeal in the exercise of discretion. 
      
       
     37 Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     38 BERGIN J: I agree 
      
       
     39 CARRUTHERS AJ: In my view, for the reasons advanced by Mr Ingram, counsel for the Crown, the manner of driving by the respondent was so dangerous to other road users that these matters called for a full custodial sentence to be imposed at first instance. By that I do not necessarily mean a full custodial sentence of two years. However, as Justice Stein has pointed out, it is now almost two years since the offence occurred and 9 months since the subject sentence was imposed upon the respondent. The respondent has been at liberty for almost two years since the offence. In these circumstances, in the exercise of the court’s residual discretion, I would dismiss the appeal notwithstanding that I consider that there was sentencing error by Judge Andrews. I therefore join in the order proposed by the presiding Judge. 
      
       
     40 STEIN JA: The order of the court is that the appeal be dismissed.

      REGINA v. IAN RAYMOND CLISSOLD 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Ian Raymond Clissold, on 27 September 2001, was re-arraigned on an indictment containing two counts, he having formerly pleaded not guilty in respect of the two offences charged. On that day, he pleaded guilty to the alternative count to that originally charged as count one, that is he pleaded guilty to manslaughter as an alternative to the charge that on 4 August 1999 at Erskine Park in the state of New South Wales, he did murder Peter John Ledger. He pleaded guilty to the second count, that is, that on that day he did assault Gregory Mark Symonds and thereby occasioned to him actual bodily harm. Those pleas were accepted by the Crown in full discharge of that indictment.  
     
      
    2 The plea to manslaughter was entered on the basis that the offender was an accessory before the fact to an unlawful and dangerous act occasioning the death of the deceased. The plea in respect of the assault upon Mark Symonds was entered upon the basis that the offender was party with others to an attack upon that man as householder in order to abduct the deceased, who was, as will appear from the recital of facts to which I will turn shortly, on the orders of the Supreme Commander of the Commancheros, Jock Ross, to be given by members of that body, supervised by the offender, the Sergeant at Arms of that body, “a flogging”. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty prescribed by law for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty prescribed by law for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment. It was conceded by counsel appearing for the offender, and entirely properly so, that the surrounding circumstances sufficiently established by the facts statement admitted by consent and part of Exhibit A on the plea, where such that the court should have regard to the offender’s culpability when sentencing for these two offences as embracing those other matters referred to in that statement which otherwise would have given rise to separate charges. They include the assault committed on the deceased at the premises of Symonds from which the deceased was abducted and which included the use of a knife on him to remove him from the home as well as that abduction. The admitted facts include the admitted detention for a period of time of Mr. Symonds in the home for the purpose of the ill treatment afforded to the deceased. It will be necessary to have regard to those matters but to recognise also that they are not separately charged. They set however, a chilling context to what in fact occurred. The legal necessity to have regard to matters such as those in the context of sentencing for homicide was recognised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Garforth (CCA, unreported 23 May 1994). It will be necessary also to have regard when sentencing to the principle established by the High Court in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 104 CLR 610 that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The culpability for each offence be particularly examined and that the court pass a sentence appropriate to each offence giving then consideration to the exercise of the discretion on whether or not such a sentence should be entirely cumulative upon some other sentence passed, or wholly or partially concurrent.” 
        
       
      
    4 The pleas came to be entered in somewhat unusual circumstances but it is not necessary that I refer in detail to the chronology surrounding their entry as it is set out in a submission helpfully filed on behalf of the offender. It is sufficient that I note the following. 
     
      
    5 On 25 September 2001 prior to the commencement of the trial that had been envisaged, I delivered judgment in respect of two matters which had been raised as appropriate for pre-trial rulings. The first concerned the admissibility of certain material that it was proposed to tender in the Crown case. That material, in particular, related to the prospect of being able to establish the location of the occasioning of the deceased’s death. It was submitted by the Crown that it could be established that the deceased was beaten to death at the Commanchero club house and the body was thereafter taken to his former wife's home and abandoned in the driveway. There was little evidence to support the submission. What evidence there was was plainly of such little probative value as merely to found a speculation. I rejected it. 
     
      
    6 In the other judgment however a question arose as to the admissibility of the identification of the offender as being one of the assailants who had arrived at the home of Symonds. Identification evidence may be unreliable and is traditionally regarded by the courts as evidence to be examined with close scrutiny. In that judgment I noted the limited nature of Mr. Symonds' prior acquaintanceship with the offender. I ruled that the evidence of the witness recognising the offender as the assailant might be admitted, however I raised in that ruling limitations on what might occur at trial concerning identification. 
     
      
    7 The pleas were entered following that ruling.  
     
      
    8 However it was accepted by the Crown in argument that the value of the plea was such that in the absence of that plea, had the trial proceeded, the evidence of Mr. Crowley, a witness to whose evidence I will return shortly, might not have been accepted beyond reasonable doubt, in which case the offender might have been acquitted entirely in any involvement in the death. It was accepted by the Crown that I should regard both the plea and the acceptance of it as proceeding from an entirely rational appreciation of that possibility. It was accepted by the Crown that absent the plea there was a substantial risk that the Crown would not achieve a conviction for the homicide at all. It was also accepted by the defence that the plea should proceed upon the basis that it admitted complicity in the death of the deceased and that it was accepted the role of the offender in the abduction of the deceased and the assault upon him at the house should be taken into account in assessing his overall culpability. It was conceded by the learned Crown Prosecutor that the plea had been accepted in recognition that after the assailants left Symonds’ house, the Crown was unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt who amongst the assailants did what and with what intention or indeed who was relevantly and critically present. Such concession was made since there was evidence of a statement made by the offender to a psychologist that although he had participated in the initial assault and abduction, prior to the conclusion of the “flogging” that had been intended, he had left the group suffering from abdominal pain and that it was never intended that the deceased should be subject to grievous bodily harm as far as he was aware. The Crown’s concession is an acceptance of an inability to disprove that proposition beyond reasonable doubt notwithstanding the evidence from Mr. Crowley to which I have already referred. In his statement, Mr. Crowley said the offender said to him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am in a bit of trouble. Jock told us to sort somebody out, he was causing a bit of trouble and teach him a lesson but it went a bit too far. There was three of us there, we gave him a beating but it went too far. It wasn’t intentional and the bloke died after it.” 
        
       
      
    9 It was accepted by the defence that that material was reliable to the extent that permitted it to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing to support all such findings other than the presence of the offender at the critical time and any controlling role of the offender at the time at which the assault, the “flogging”, escalated from one in which no serious physical injury was to be occasioned to the deceased to one where really serious physical injury or death was intended to be or might have been or contemplated to be occasioned. 
     
      
    10 I proceed to deal with the matter therefore on that basis. 
     
      
    11 I turn now to the agreed statement of facts. 
     
      
    12 The offender and the deceased were members of the Western Chapter of the Commancheros Motor Cycle Club. The offender held the position of Sergeant at Arms within the club; the deceased was an ordinary member. The deceased had stayed overnight at the home of Symonds on the evening of 3 August 1999. Shortly before 8pm on 4 August, Symonds answered the knock on the front door to find Brady Hamilton, a member of the Commancheros, the offender and another man, who apparently had some association with the Commancheros, standing outside. When Hamilton was informed by Symonds that Ledger was present, the three forcibly entered the house. The offender threatened Symonds with a knife and punched him to the left side of his head, dazing him. Symonds was ordered to move along the hallway and upon the kitchen being reached the offender punched Symonds to the ear, knocking him to the floor. 
     
      
    13 The deceased who had been asleep on a lounge was approached. A sum of money was demanded of him. That sum had apparently been involved in some form of dispute arising within the club in circumstances apparently connected with an offer or attempt to purchase or sell a motor bike. It is not necessary for me to resolve the detail of that matter. Apparently these persons had attended on the premises with a view to obtaining the money, the deceased’s club colours and to enforce some form of club discipline at the instigation of the Supreme Commander, Jock Ross. The offender than began punching the deceased heavily and repeatedly to the face with his fists. The money and the colours were demanded. The deceased begged Symonds to help him. Symonds replied saying he did not know what was going on and did not want to know. The deceased was punched again a number of times. He was crying out when he was punched. The unidentified man had a meat cleaver in his hand. The offender had the knife which he pressed against the deceased’s back and ordered him from the house. Symonds was ordered not to go near the phone. Tersely, the Crown statement of facts continues:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The deceased, Ledger, was taken by the prisoner and the others to an unknown location where he was savagely beaten. About 9.25 pm that evening his dead body was found in the driveway of the home of his estranged wife, Margaret ledger, at 8 Pictor Street, Erskine Park.” 
        
       
      
    14 The body was examined for its injuries. There were sustained numerous bruises, lacerations and abrasions to the head, body, arms and legs of the deceased. During an internal examination the forensic pathologist observed and noticed lacerations to the lower lip and left side of the mouth. Fracturing and extensive damage to the left side of the jaw. Extensive bruising under the scalp. Blood in the cavity of the right lung. A fracture to the skull which extended into the base of the skull. Extensive fractures to the face including to the right cheek bone being completely detached from the rest of the face, the anterior wall of the upper jaw bone being fractured with exposure of the right maxillary sinus, fractures through the left cheek bone and upper jaw bone and several fractures through the lower jaw bone. A fracture in the hard pallet and part of the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull. Fractures with associated bruising through the third to twelfth rib on the right side, the fractures of the seventh, eight and ninth rib causing penetration into the pulmo cavity and lacerations of the lung. A fracture with extensive dislocation and soft tissue injury through the shaft of the left femur and widespread soft tissue injury in the left knee joint and soft tissues beneath the fracture. A fracture to the medial knuckle of the left femur, a fracture with minor dislocation of the mid shaft of the left fibula with surrounding soft tissue damage. The pathologist concluded that death was due to the effects of severe injuries consistent with a severe beating and that the major injuries to the leg and chest would have contributed to the death by virtue of blood loss and impairment of breathing. 
     
      
    15 Certain injuries were inflicted to the knees and legs of the deceased. There was submitted to me, on the voir dire, evidence concerning the use of a spike knuckle-duster. It was accepted that for the purposes of this plea, I could have regard to such evidence as had not been ruled inadmissible on the voir dire. The evidence was no higher than that the spiked knuckle-duster which had been located following these events was consistent with the sort of implement that may have inflicted wounds of the nature of those seen to the knees and legs of the deceased. I am unable to say that the offender was aware of the use or intended use of some such implement consistent with the basis upon which the plea was entered and accepted. 
     
      
    16 I must not, having regard to the conclusion of the pathologist that the injuries that may have been inflicted by such an implement contributed to the death and plainly and obviously would have been the occasioning of grievous bodily harm, attribute a culpability to the offender in respect of those matters going beyond the ambit upon which the plea was entered and accepted. However I accept, and it is within the admission made by the offender, that the attack upon the deceased at Symonds’ home was not only committed in company with others but by the use of weapons including the meat cleaver held by the associate and the knife with which the offender threatened the deceased and abducted him from the premises. 
     
      
    17 In August 1999, following the death of the deceased, the offender visited the home of the father of Michelle Crowley in the mid north coast. It was there he made to Mr. Crowley the admission to which I have referred concerning the instructions given to him by Jock Ross. He was arrested on 25 January 2000. When interviewed by the police he maintained his right to silence. 
     
      
    18 He has a prior criminal record. It is a record of some substance. It commences some 20 years ago when he was put upon a bond for stealing. It involves earlier offences of assault and malicious injury, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault female, malicious damage, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and traffic matters, however courts have extended leniency to him in respect of those matters, in particular he has had the benefit of sentences being deferred, upon him entering into recognisances, of being sentenced for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to a sentence of some two years extent involving a minimum term of one year, and being fined for traffic matters, although sentenced also to six months imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified. This will be his first substantial sentence of imprisonment if one disregards the sentence for the earlier outburst of violence. 
     
      
    19 The facts of that matter were put before me, by consent, on the plea. There had been a substantial difference in versions of what had occurred giving rise to that plea before the sentencing judge. It was the offender’s contention that he struck one blow against the windscreen of the vehicle of his victim with a piece of wood he had picked up from the side of the road in response to what he contended was harassment by the victim. The victim had apparently had a relationship with the lady who was then the offender’s preferred companion. 
     
      
    20 The trial judge found that he struck at least one blow and accepted otherwise the account of the victim. The trial judge accepted that the offender was at that time angry and acted on impulse, that the offender had a psychological history of behavioural problems resulting in a tendency for him to get into arguments and have trouble in controlling his violent impulses. This at least, the trial judge accepted, was partly in consequence of the offender having been injured by a person who shot him with a shotgun occasioning injuries to his head causing migraines and pressures and a lack of ability to cope with stressful situations. The trial judge considered there should be some leniency because of that matter but found that the effects upon the victim of the “at least one blow” were catastrophic. The victim suffered a penetrating injury to his right eye, the result of which was that the eye had to be taken out and he lost its use.  
     
      
    21 There does not seem to be, in the facts as found here and admitted by the defence, any basis upon which it could be said that this offence arose on impulse, occasioned by some inability to control reactions arising from a consequence of the injuries sustained in the shooting to which the trial judge referred when passing that sentence to which I have referred. This was a premeditated exercise of club discipline committed by the Sergeant at Arms of the club under the orders of the Supreme Commander. 
     
      
    22 In the material provided to me on behalf of the Crown there was extensive material referring to the events which have been summarised in the statement of facts. In addition, I was provided with the victim impact statement of Margaret Ledger, the wife of the deceased, and a victim impact statement of Gregory Symonds.  
     
      
    23 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 makes particular provision, and differently, for how each statement should be regarded. Division 2 of that Act contains s.27. Subsection (2) provides that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to an offence that is being dealt with by this Court the division applies only if the offence is being dealt with on indictment and is an offence that results in the death of or actual physical bodily harm to any person.” 
        
       
      
    24 Section 28(1) provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “That if it considers it appropriate to do so the Supreme Court or District Court may receive and consider a victim impact statement before it sentences an offender.” 
        
       
      
    25 Subsection (3) provides that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence” as here, “the Supreme Court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family member and acknowledge its receipt and may make any comment on it that the Court considers appropriate."" 
        
       
      
    26 The law in this state concerning how such a statement must be taken into account has been enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. at 76. In the case of a homicide the statement is noted by the court, and it has been held to be inappropriate that the content of the statement should be used in order that a more severe sentence than would otherwise be passed, might be passed lest that should suggest that the Court might value human lives differently depending upon what might be said by others concerning the impact of the death upon them. It is however accepted law that one can have regard and must have regard to the effects of a crime upon the victim. I do not understand Previtera (supra) to stand in the way of the application of that principle even in the case of a homicide. It is concerning the effect of the death on others as differentially affecting the penalty that it speaks. It does not require the court to ignore the manner of the death or the effect of it on others entirely. In each case I will treat the victims’ impact statements to which I have referred in accordance with those principles. 
     
      
    27 When the statements were provided during the arguments before me, I referred to the fact that when a death is occasioned it diminishes the whole of the community and gravely affects the deceased’s loved ones and friends and the recognition by the court of those matters. That there should be such a principle is not only a matter of law but one of common humanity. The court carries forward that principle into the court’s function in sentencing but does not give to the life of one person rather than another some special significance. 
     
      
    28 I turn to the evidence provided on behalf of the offender. Michelle Crowley provided a reference in which she referred to his generosity, kindness and good manners to members of her family and the kindness to her children he showed during their relationship. She referred to the effects upon her and the children of his absence. 
     
      
    29 The Reverend Hannah, who was the parish priest in Mount Druitt, referred to the offender's family circumstances and in particular that his father had been injured in a serious accident; and that his mother, now an elder in the Aboriginal community had been a member of the stolen generation. He referred to the offender's relationship with his family and his children. He gave some valuable background to which I will turn again when I come to the report of Messrs Duffy, Barrier, Robilliard, psychologists. 
     
      
    30 The offender left school at the age of 15, suffers from dyslexia and is still, at least to a substantial extent if not entirely illiterate. Nonetheless he has worked continuously in one employment or another and has had regard for his family and sought to support those with a moral claim upon him, not only by reason of obligation but out of affection and caring for them. This, notwithstanding the very substantial problems experienced by members of that family by reason of matters not under the offender’s control, or his fault, but which make his efforts in their regard which are to be garnered from what appears in Father Hannah’s report, the more estimable. 
     
      
    31 Captain Carter, the Anglican chaplain, Department of Corrective Services, refers to the two years of the offender’s custody and his contact which is weekly or more with the offender. He refers to the offender as being a cooperative inmate adding to the good order of prison life. He refers to his conscientious conduct in gaol and the high level of trust in him. He has discussed with the offender the family issues arising from his confinement and underlines the offender’s concern for his partner and the children. 
     
      
    32 There is also a report, notably, given on his behalf by various prison officers, including the senior prison officer, and education officer, an Aboriginal welfare officer and an alcohol and drug officer, which refers to his work within the gaol and his ability to assist with the management of other prisoners with particular problems, as a support person under the supervision of gaol staff. In particular it praises his role assisting at risk inmates avoid what is referred to as “an exacerbating situation”. It refers to his cooperation and communication with gaol staff and his assistance with inmates at all levels and from many different cultural backgrounds as being invaluable in the resolving of sensitive issues. It says that his behaviour in gaol has been exemplary. 
     
      
    33 Kevin Walters has also given a reference, he having employed the offender as security officer at a nightclub and restaurant and later in working in the tow truck industry, doing mechanical repairs, cleaning and maintenance. He praises the offender’s conscientiousness and trustworthiness in a personal and professional capacity. He refers to the offender’s role in attempting to resolve disputes within the Commanchero motor cycle club, although he refers to the offender as seeking to resolve tension within the club, or outside of it by a peaceful amicable solution. He contends that on his assessment of the offender he was used by others to mete out discipline but also that the offender is such a person as would never have wished for anybody to be fatally injured. He says the offender feels deep remorse and is a man with a strong sense of morality and loyalty. 
     
      
    34 Greg Babbage furnished a reference and also gave evidence. That evidence related to the offender’s prior circumstances and his family and the kindness the offender had shown to Mr. Babbage’s children. He too, as had the other referees to whom I have referred, praised aspects of the offender’s character and had offered to support him when he is discharged from custody.  
     
      
    35 In the report from Duffy, Barrier, Robilliard there was an extensive review of the offender’s circumstances. That review was conducted in the context of the psychologist being afforded material by way of background as set out in the report. In summary, the report confirms in some detail the observations others have made of him and of his circumstances. It is not necessary that I go into detail concerning those matters. The report refers to the background to the offence and that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As ‘Master Sergeant’ the offender recognised his responsibility to maintain law and order within the club to ‘go and sort out problems.’” 
        
       
      
    36 The report refers to this as being a statement concerning the responsibility to arbitrate. He said “Some people thought I was too soft”, but accepted that his reputation as a boxer earned him respect. He added, “I treated everyone the way I wanted to be treated”. When he moved to the south coast with his family, it was apparently partly to remove himself from more active club life but when the matter concerning the deceased arose, he was called on to intervene and felt a duty to respond. 
     
      
    37 To the psychologist he said that he is now very sorry he left the deceased with the other two assailants when he did. He referred to being with the group that had abducted the deceased and taken him from Symonds' home but said that he left the group as he was suffering abdominal pain, admitting that he knew that the deceased was going to get “a flogging”. He said he left because he was sick. He feels that if he had stayed he would have been able to keep some control of the situation. He said that he does not believe that it is appropriate to “take the law into the hands of the club”, that he was sorry for the victim’s young son who will now grow up without a father.  
     
      
    38 The psychologists concluded after administering numerous tests that he tested out in the well below average range of intelligence, in the bottom three per cent of the population, that his intelligence deficits however were masked by his personable manner and good communication skills. He has a rudimentary level of reading and, although well socialised and functioning effectively, has an intellectual level barely above mildly mentally retarded. He is slow to generate solutions to problems and paranoid in his thinking, hypersensitive to criticism or rejection. He feels safer and more comfortable in the company of those he perceives as stronger than himself and is likely to adopt their image. He values the camaraderie and feeling of belonging of motor cycle club membership. It is concluded that he appears to differentiate appropriately between what he sees as the rights and limitations of maintaining club law and taking the laws of the community into club hands. 
     
      
    39 On the argument concerning the submissions made on plea, a question arose as to whether his adherence to the disciplinary function entrusted to him by the Supreme Commander was a matter which should mitigate the penalty for this offence. That matter has to be considered in the context that notwithstanding what has now occurred, there is no evidence before me to suggest that the offender has terminated his life membership of the Commancheros, albeit there is some evidence, particularly in the report of the psychologist to suggest that he has sought to distance himself from the active day to day role a member of that body might have, but nonetheless as far as one can tell he retains a loyalty to the objects of the club and its Supreme Commander. 
     
      
    40 That leads me then to a consideration of the relevant sentence. It was accepted in argument eventually by the Crown that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was present and participated in the final assault, though I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he bears legal responsibility for the death appropriate to his complicity in the unlawful and dangerous acts which occasioned that death. Although to some extent it was submitted to the contrary, it does not appear to me that if having supervised and directed others to undertake a beating, for some fortuitous cause the offender is not present and those others go too far and beat the person to death, there is much that can be said to mitigate the culpability of having put in train those events, particularly where, as here, the offender had a primary role, using a weapon in the abduction, beating and eventually abandoning the deceased to the attentions of his co-offenders, who inflicted such appalling injuries occasioning the deceased’s death. The relevant culpability for manslaughter, whilst it may not be that of the worst class of case, is very, very high. As far as his personal circumstances go, the prior criminal history of the offender is to be set against what has been said on his behalf by way of his gentleness and good character. In argument it was discussed that there should be full concurrence between the sentences for the two offences but upon reviewing what the High Court has said in Pearce (supra), although the offences are closely related and the culpability of each to an extent embraces that of the other, I am unable to conclude that there should not be within the total sentence a specific reflection of the culpability of the acts perpetrated upon Mr. Symonds. I have concluded therefore that there will be a substantial degree of concurrence in the sentences passed but that they will not be wholly concurrent. It was accepted in the submissions of both counsel that an appropriate sentence in respect of the assault upon Mr Symonds, having regard to all considerations and including having regard to what is said in the victim’s impact statement, was that the offender be sentenced to a fixed term of four years. 
     
      
    41 It is not that sentence which will loom largest of course when one comes to consider the total criminality. I am reminded by the written submissions of the Crown that the starting point of sentence for the major offence is the recognition that the crime deals with the occasioning of the death of another human being and in this case with an attack of viciousness and savagery which preceded a much more vicious and appalling torture and killing of the victim. Whilst I have resolved that I cannot be satisfied that the offender was present, nonetheless I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s influence still remained throughout the beating. I accept the Crown’s submission that the offender was the original instigator of the assaults and the instigator of the viciousness and brutality used at the Symonds’ home. 
     
      
    42 As an assault amounting to an unlawful and dangerous act, the assault contemplated by the offender to be committed upon the deceased falls into that category of being one of the worst one could contemplate short of the deliberate infliction of grievous bodily harm and it resulted in this brutal killing. There was a degree of planning. It is an offence which should be marked by a considerable measure of personal deterrent and denunciation, particularly having regard to it being committed in the context of an exercise of club discipline, so that others will be deterred from being engaged in such events, even if it is not an offence which I should conclude was marked by an intention or realisation on his part that some such consequences as did eventually occur, resulting in the deceased’s death should come to pass. 
     
      
    43 I accept that there is some degree of contrition. I accept that the plea was of considerable utility in the context that the Crown might not otherwise have succeeded in obtaining a conviction at all. Thus I am of the view that the utility of the plea, having regard to the principle in the Regina v. Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 is high. I regard the plea in the circumstances as having been entered at the first reasonably practicable opportunity, that being the time at which the Crown was first minded to consider offering that such a plea might be accepted and in that regard I will treat the plea in accordance with the principle laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision in Regina v. Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310.  
     
      
    44 Further, in addition to that limited contrition to which I have referred, I will take into account the subjective element in such a plea that the offender, by the plea, intended to facilitate the processes of justice, having regard to the prospect that the Crown might have failed at trial. Nonetheless having regard to all of those matters and to the extent to which such a plea might discount a sentence otherwise applicable (see Regina v. Thomson & Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383), I consider that the submitted discount put by the offender’s counsel of 30% is far too high. This is an appropriate matter, having regard to all the offences and the taking into account as I have been asked to do, of all those other offences when sentencing for the two offences charged, for the offender to receive a discount in the order of 20%.  
     
      
    45 Accepting that the sentences imposed must reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and my conclusion that the homicide offence, whilst not the worst class of offence, nonetheless is very, very serious, I have concluded that the appropriate sentence to pass, having regard to all the matters to which I have referred is a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. The sentence on count 2, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence, as I have said, should be a sentence for a fixed term. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s.45 permits me to decline to impose a non-parole period for that sentence in the circumstances set out in s.45(1). In this case my reason for declining to impose a non-parole period is because of the penalty to be imposed in respect of the homicide offence and because on that offence I will impose a non-parole period. In that regard, in respect of the extent of that percent and noting s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I find special circumstances which permits the imposition for the manslaughter of a non-parole period of a lesser extent than that which would otherwise be required because of the length of the sentence to be imposed, that it is partly cumulative. I have determined to impose a non-parole period of eight years. I have already referred to the exercise of my discretion as to the extent to which the sentences are to be made consecutive or concurrent. The sentence on count two will date from 25 January 2000 and be by way of a four year fixed term. The sentence on count one of 14 years will date from 25 January 2002 and the non-parole period of eight years will date from that date and expire on 24 January 2010. I would invite counsel at this point to check the figures. 
     
      
       
      WEBB: I cannot see any error there your Honour. 
       
      
    46 HIS HONOUR: The sentence reflects the submission put to me by counsel for the offender that the appropriate range of penalty in the upshot would be in the lower double figures end of the range available. I make that note specifically since it was submitted by the Crown that the matter should be treated as in the worst class of case so that the sentence should be at the upper end of the range in manslaughter. When one has regard to an appropriate synthesis of all considerations, and particularly those to which I have referred as discounting the sentence that would otherwise be received by dint of the plea, it appears to me that no lesser and no greater sentence than I have indicated should be imposed. 
     
      
    47 Would you please rise Mr. Clissold. For the reasons that I have given on count two you are sentenced to a fixed term of four years imprisonment to date from 25 January 2000. On count one you are sentenced to 14 years imprisonment to date from 25 January 2002 and in respect of that sentence I impose a non-parole period of eight years to date from 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2010. The prisoner may be removed.

      70015/02 - REGINA v Raigan Frances RICHARDS 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 27 March 2002, Mrs Raigan Frances Richards was arraigned on three counts, namely: 
     
      
    · First, that on 7 February 2001 at Wyee in the State of New South Wales, she did murder Reily Shayne Richards 
     
      
    · Secondly, that on 7 February 2001 at Wyee in the State of New South Wales, by administration of carbon monoxide, she did attempt to murder Mahon Richards. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, that on 7 February 2001 at Wyee in the State of New South Wales, by administration of carbon monoxide, she did attempt to murder Braedy Richards. 
     
      
    2 Mrs Richards pleaded guilty to the second and third counts of attempted murder. She pleaded not guilty to the first count, murder, but guilty of manslaughter upon the basis that, at the time of the offence, she was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
     
      
    3 It remains for me to now pass sentence. In order to do so, I must determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion (Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1). Where facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mrs Richards, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities (R v Storey (1997) A Crim R 519; Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
    4 Reily Shayne Richards was a baby aged almost 21 months. Mahon was aged eleven years and Braedy six years. Mrs Richards was the mother of each child. The circumstances in which Reily died, and the attempt was made upon the lives of Mahon and Braedy, are not in doubt. Mrs Richards, driven by a delusion, which I will shortly describe, attempted to end their lives and her own life by introducing carbon monoxide fumes into the cabin of the motor vehicle in which they all slept. Only Reily died. 
     
      
    5 The circumstances giving rise to this tragedy are complex. However, they are important. They shed light upon the state of mind of Mrs Richards and the extent to which is can be said that she was morally blameworthy. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    6 Mrs Raigan Richards was born on 9 March 1963 at Lithgow. Her mother separated from her father soon after her birth. Her mother later remarried. Mrs Richards gained the Higher School Certificate. She excelled in music. She enrolled in a post graduate degree at the Conservatorium of Music. However, she discontinued that degree after about 18 months, distracted by other things. Nonetheless, she worked as a musician. She played the piano and violin. She also taught music. 
     
      
    7 In January 1989, Mrs Richards married Mr Anthony Duff. Mahon was born on 3 November 1989. She claimed that the marriage was violent from the outset. She told a psychiatrist that she persisted in the marriage because she was a Catholic. She believed that it was her obligation to make the marriage work. She ultimately got a job which, in her words, gave her the courage to leave the marriage. She and Mr Duff were divorced on 7 October 1993. 
     
      
    8 Mrs Richards returned to Lithgow. She lived with her mother and step-father. She again worked as a musician. She met Mr Mark Richards, whom she later married. Braedy was born on 10 August 1994. Reily was born on 18 May 1999. Again, according to Mrs Richards, the marriage was characterised by domestic violence. The police came to the house a number of times.  
     
      
    9 Mr Richards enrolled in a programme in 1998 to assist him in curbing such violence. The programme lasted twenty weeks. According to Mr Rowe, who ran that programme, Mrs Richards reported a significant improvement in their marriage as a consequence. Mr Rowe also provided counselling to Mr and Mrs Richards from September 1999 until the break up of their marriage on 22 December 1999. In the course of these sessions Mr Rowe, on occasions, observed outbursts from Mrs Richards and an absence of self-control. He had some concern for the safety of the children. When Mr Rowe became aware of accusations by Mrs Richards against her husband, Mark Richards, in February the following year (which I will shortly describe), he notified the Department of Community Services, DOCS, of his concern. 
     
      
    10 The argument which led to the separation of Mrs Richards and her husband on 22 December 1999, was violent. Mrs Richards pressed charges against her husband. She said that as a result he was placed upon a good behaviour bond. She obtained, as well, an Apprehended Violence Order on her own behalf and on behalf of her parents. 
     
      
    11 Mr and Mrs Richards had, until their separation, conducted a business tinting the windows of motor vehicles. Discussions began concerning the division of property, including the business and their home. 
     
      
    12 In February 2000, Braedy, who was then five and a half years, reported to Mrs Richards conduct which he attributed to his father. It alarmed Mrs Richards. The conduct, without repeating the detail, suggested paedophilia by her estranged husband directed at both Reily and Braedy. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Richards reported the matter to DOCS. She obtained an interim order stopping access to the children by her estranged husband. 
     
      
    14 A Joint Investigative Team, comprising police and officers from DOCS, began an investigation. Mr Richards was interviewed. He denied the allegations. The Joint Investigative Team made a number of inquiries. It interviewed Braedy on 9 March 2000. As a consequence of its investigation, it recommended that Mr Richards should have supervised access to his children. 
     
      
    15 Mrs Richards was devastated by that recommendation. She endeavoured to engage the interest of politicians who had been vocal on the subject of child abuse. 
     
      
    16 A short time after the first allegations had been made, Mrs Richards stated that Braedy reported further conduct by her estranged husband, Mr Mark Richards, this time involving a somewhat older boy who lived next door. Mrs Richards passed this information to the Joint Investigative Team. That Team interviewed the neighbouring boy on 30 March 2000. 
     
      
    17 On 2 April 2000, Braedy reported a further and more disturbing matter. He described a place called ""Uncle Jack's place"" and activities within that place. Those activities involved not only Mark Richards, but Mrs Richards' first husband, Mr Tony Duff. Braedy had been taken to that house, as had the boy next door. 
     
      
    18 Mrs Richards formed the belief that there was a paedophile ring, and that both her former husbands were part of that ring. She reported the matter to her neighbour, the mother of the child said to have been abused. The material placed before me includes a statement from that woman. That person recognised, from the description of the incident provided by the children, the occasion which they were describing. She knew that on that occasion she, not Mrs Richards' former husband (as the children had suggested), had provided transport to and from the particular location. That information was passed to Mrs Richards. However, it was not accepted. Rather, Mrs Richards referred the issue back to Braedy. Braedy reaffirmed his account. Mrs Richards chose to believe her child, as she said in evidence before me. She gave the following testimony: (T59) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I maintain, I believe what my children told me, that's all I maintain."" 
        
       
      
    19 Mrs Richards interpreted the neighbour's apparent acceptance of what was happening as an indication of complicity in what was taking place. 
     
      
    20 On 3 April 2000, Mrs Richards reported what she knew to the Joint Investigative Team. Indeed, she went to the Joint Investigative Team the next day. She formed the impression that they would not listen to her. On 9 April 2000, according to the account she gave to Professor Quadrio, psychiatrist, she telephoned DOCS, reporting the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""My first husband was involved, my second husband, and now it was my neighbour."" 
        
       
      
    21 The Joint Investigative Team, interviewed Mrs Richards for some two and a half hours. The day following, a female officer from the Joint Investigative Team came to see Mrs Richards. She suggested that Mrs Richards needed counselling. She took her to the James Fletcher Psychiatric Hospital. She assured her that her children would be looked after. 
     
      
    22 Mrs Richards remained a patient of that hospital from 12 April 2000 until 28 April 2000. The material before me incorporates a report from the Clinical Director, Dr Clark, of 28 April 2000, which includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mrs Richards is currently diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (professionally Delusioned Disorder) and is accepting treatment for same, though she seems to have no other insight into her illness. This diagnostic viewpoint has been confirmed at a senior consultant level. It does not directly reflect on the outcomes of ongoing JIT (Joint Investigative Team) inquiries."" 
        
       
      
    23 Mrs Richards was discharged into the care of her cousin upon the following conditions, as set out in the report of Dr Clark: 
     
      
    · ""that continued psychiatric care be provided by the Mental Health Team at Liverpool, this transfer of care has been accepted, 
     
      
    · that Mrs Richards does not undertake care of the children or have contact with them, unless directly supervised by a responsible adult, until countermanded by her psychiatric carers following appropriate review of issues of clinical well-being and risk."" 
     
      
    24 Mrs Richards was not happy with aspects of her treatment at the James Fletcher Hospital. She, and those who supported her, wanted a second opinion. Arrangements were made by her solicitor in the Family Court proceedings for her to see Dr Jonathon Carne, psychiatrist. She saw Dr Carne on 5 April 2000. He prepared a report in which he stated his view in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""From my review of the medical records it seems that Ms Richards was suffering from a delusional disorder, a psychotic illness in which there is a loss of reality testing and the possession of an irrational set of beliefs not amenable to logical analysis and without any cultural basis. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion Ms Richards is probably suffering from a delusional disorder possibly caused by the hypomanic phase of bipolar affective disorder (manic depression), however I am not in a position to judge whether her allegations are true."" 
        
       
      
    25 Dr Carne made the following recommendations: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. Ms Richards remains under psychiatric treatment and follows the recommendations of her treating psychiatrist. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Strenuous efforts are made to investigate the veracity of Ms Richards allegations, as that has a considerable bearing on her psychiatric diagnosis. My present feeling is that her beliefs are largely delusional and that the paedophile ring is probably a product of her delusional system."" 
        
       
      
    26 The Family Court proceedings came before the Registrar on 31 May 2000. The purpose was to determine orders for interim access. The fathers were given access on most weekends. In the case of Mr Mark Richards, access was granted upon the basis that it would be supervised because of issues of domestic violence. Mrs Richards was also told that she would lose custody unless she was supervised by a responsible adult. Her mother and step-father therefore moved to her home in Wyee to exercise that supervision. 
     
      
    27 Mrs Richards continued to pursue the matters that had come to her notice through DOCS. In the meantime, the Family Court ordered a psychiatric assessment of Mrs Richards by an independent psychiatrist appointed by the Court, pursuant to Order 30A of the Family Law Rules. A file note made by DOCS on 27 September 2000, included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Regan said she could not understand the point of having a district officer if future allegations were not investigated. Regan expressed concern when she was reminded of what had been stated at the PPM on the 23.8.00. At that meeting she was advised that no further sexual assault notifications would be investigated prior to the completion of the Section 30A Assessment by the Family Court. The reason given was because of concerns previously expressed by JIT (Joint Investigative Team) when investigating a sexual assault notification that they felt that Braedy had been coached and he is at risk of systems abuse if continually interviewed. Further that it was important that the Family Court Assessment not be contaminated."" 
        
       
      
    28 In September 2000, Mrs Richards approached an organisation, ASCA, which assists persons dealing with sexual abuse. Ms Mullinar, a founding member of that organisation, described Mrs Richards as being ""in despair"". She did not believe, however, that either Mrs Richards or her children were at risk. Through the organisation Mrs Richards was given emotional support and assistance. Ms Mullinar said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The way she spoke of her children, it was as though the children were her life."" 
        
       
      
    29 In January 2001, Mrs Richards was interviewed by Dr Wootton, the psychiatrist appointed by the Family Court. Mrs Richards was filled with optimism after that interview. She believed that she was assured of custody. 
     
      
       
      The Family Court Hearing 
       
      
    30 Mrs Richards had been less than happy with the solicitor who was appearing for her in the Family Court proceedings. The hearing, which would determine the issue of custody, was set down for the week beginning Monday 5 February 2001. On the Friday before that hearing, the solicitor for Mrs Richards withdrew. A replacement was found, Mr Rod Powe. Mr Powe was hampered, however, by not having access to the file. 
     
      
    31 On Monday 5 February 2001, Mr Powe sought an adjournment. Mr Mark Richards and Mr Tony Duff were each represented by a solicitor and barrister. The adjournment was refused. On Tuesday 6 February 2001, the report of Dr Wootton was disclosed to the parties. That report does not form part of the material before me. The Family Court, in the context of its proceedings, regarded the report as a confidential document. The parties were not provided with copies. Rather, they, and their advisors, were allowed to read the report at Court. 
     
      
    32 Mrs Richards read the report with disbelief. In the report, she was characterised as a person suffering from a serious psychiatric condition, requiring a further period in hospital of 12 months. Dr Wootton was of the opinion that she should take anti-psychotic medication. He recommended that custody of the children should be awarded to Mr Mark Richards for a trial period of six months. 
     
      
    33 Mrs Richards spoke to her solicitor, having read the report. She asked what hope she had of regaining custody at the end of the 12 months. According to the account she gave to psychiatrists, she was told, ""Not good"". 
     
      
    34 The case was adjourned until the following day, Wednesday 7 February 2001. Mrs Richards was to bring the children to Court. It was expected that they would then be handed over to her former husband. 
     
      
    35 Mrs Richards was entirely unprepared for this blow. She was in a state of panic. According to her mother, she cried hysterically. Once home, she discussed with her parents ""clearing out"". Her parents counselled her against that course. She recognised that it was not an option. She had no money. She accepted that she would be found. She also understood that, having been found, she may never see her children again. 
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    36 At some point that evening, Mrs Richards determined that the only solution for her and the children was escape to heaven, through death. The alternative, in her mind, was handing the children to someone whom she believed had sexually abused the children, and would do so again. She told Professor Quadrio this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I had to save them. I sat and discussed it with Mahon. I know I had no right to ask him but I was pushed over the edge. I said to Mahon, 'we'll go to sleep'. He said 'does it hurt'. I said 'no'."" 
        
       
      
    37 Mrs Richards now recognises how inappropriate and wrong it was to converse with Mahon in this way. In evidence before me, which I accept, she said this: (T64) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. ... would you think he was giving you permission to do what you did? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No I didn't think he was giving me permission. I asked him. I was in a state of panic. When I asked him, I look back now, how can you ask a 10 year old child whether he wants to live or die. It is impossible. I had no right to ask him, no right whatsoever, he's a 10 year old child for God's sake. You have no idea of the state of my mind, the panic and desperation. You don't go round asking 10 year old kids whether they want to live or die."" 
        
       
      
    38 At 2.00 am on 7 February 2001, Mrs Richards drove to remote bushland at Wyee, with her three children. She took with her a length of hose and a can of petrol. The can of petrol she described as ""back up"". She connected the hose to the car's exhaust, and by this means introduced carbon monoxide fumes into the cabin of the vehicle. She woke to find that Reily had died. She and the boys were alive. Mrs Richards gave the following description to Professor Quadrio of what she then did: (p 24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""'Then I woke up and Reily was the only one gone, so I thought I had to finish saving them. It was all about saving the kids.' She took the petrol and set light to it. It caught fire but the car didn't explode. Then she 'felt the heat and felt that I couldn't do it'. She picked up Reily's body and 'we ran'. The car exploded and blew up."" 
        
       
      
    39 Mrs Richards and the two boys were given a lift to their home by a passing motorist. The police were called. Mrs Richards described to the police exactly what she had done. She held nothing back. 
     
      
    40 She was taken with Mahon and Braedy to the Gosford Hospital. The children were examined. They had no physical abnormality. They were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning with oxygen. They were discharged from hospital into the care of the Department of Community Services. 
     
      
    41 Mrs Richards was arrested. She remained in hospital for some days, being transferred to the gaol on 9 February 2001. 
     
      
       
      The Objective Seriousness of the Offences 
       
      
    42 Determining an appropriate sentence requires both an understanding of the objective seriousness of the offences committed, as well as the personal circumstances of the offender. There is, of course, nothing more precious than human life, and nothing more poignant than the loss of a young child. Manslaughter is the felonious taking of human life. Attempted murder is the attempt to take the life of another. In this case, the attempts, of course, involved two lives, both young children. 
     
      
    43 However, there are, as you would expect, degrees of culpability in which there are a number of variables. In The Queen v Blacklidge (unreported, CCA, 12 December 1995), Gleeson CJ said this: (at p4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability."" 
        
       
      
    44 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered upon the basis that Mrs Richards was, at the time, substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. The Crown accepted that plea. That plea involves the partial defence which was formerly referred to as diminished responsibility. In the same case, the Chief Justice made this comment upon that partial defence: (p 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... The abnormality of mind substantially impairs the offender's mental responsibility for his or her act but it does not negate such responsibility. The reduction in the capacity for self control which results from the abnormality of mind diminishes the responsibility but it does not excuse the act ( 
        R v Low 
         (1991) 57 A Crim R 8)."" 
        
       
      
    45 The partial defence has application in the context of manslaughter (s23A Crimes Act 1900). It does not apply to the offences of attempted murder. Nonetheless, similar issues arise in the context of those offences in determining the objective criminality which they involve on the part of Mrs Richards. 
     
      
    46 It becomes important, therefore, to investigate the state of mind of Mrs Richards at the time she committed these offences. To what extent is it reasonable to attribute culpability or moral blameworthiness to her, given her state of mind? 
     
      
       
      The Psychiatric Opinions 
       
      
    47 The psychiatrists on this issue speak with one voice. Although I do not have the report of Dr Wootton of February 2001, it is plain that he regarded Mrs Richards as psychiatrically disturbed and in need of hospitalisation and anti-psychotic medication. 
     
      
    48 Mrs Richards, shortly after this tragedy, was taken to hospital. She was admitted to the Mandala Clinic, a psychiatric unit attached to the Gosford District Hospital. She was examined by Dr Darcy. Dr Darcy furnished a report of 7 February 2001, which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I formed the opinion on what I heard from her that she was probably suffering from delusional beliefs..."" 
        
       
      
    49 Professor Quadrio described the mental state of Mrs Richards in these words: (p 32) 
     
      
       
        
        ""On the basis of this psychiatric assessment, my conclusion is that at the time of the offence Ms Richards was suffering from an abnormality of mind, a Delusional Disorder, such that she was unable to understand exactly what she was doing in rational terms. In an irrational way she knew what she was doing. She believed that she was saving herself and her children from the paedophile ring. She held that conviction absolutely and acted on it, absolutely believing it to be true. This belief was a delusional one and Ms Richards acted on that delusional belief. At the moment that Mrs Richards undertook to kill herself and her children, she did not have the capacity to understand that what she was doing was wrong. She truly believed that she was saving her children."" 
        
       
      
    50 Professor Quadrio offered the opinion that Mrs Richards had available to her the defence of mental illness, which, were it established as a probability, would render her not guilty of the offence. She said this: (p 35) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is my opinion that Ms Richards was not responsible for her actions in relation to these offences because she is suffering from a mental illness. That mental illness is a psychotic one and is well recognised psychiatrically as constituting an abnormality of mind."" 
        
       
      
    51 Professor Quadrio added: (p 35) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the event that the Court may not accept that defence, it is my view that Ms Richards must be seen to be suffering from an abnormality of mind that constitutes substantial impairment."" 
        
       
      
    52 The Director of Public Prosecutions qualified a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, to examine Mrs Richards and express a view. The view reached by Dr Nielssen did not differ from that of Professor Quadrio. In his report of 21 September 2001, Dr Nielssen said this: (p 9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I believe Ms Richards has the defence of mental illness open to her. She has a defect of reason arising from a disease of the mind, in the form of the delusional belief that there was a conspiracy involving both of her former husbands, her neighbour and other members of the community to sexually abuse her children. At the time of the offence, she was deprived of the knowledge that killing the children and committing suicide herself were wrong, as she believed that the children would be returned to a situation in which they would be subjected to sexual abuse. Moreover, in her acutely distressed state, she was unable to reason with any measure of calmness or composure about the consequences of her actions."" 
        
       
      
    53 Dr Nielssen added: (p 9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Ms Richards would also be able to raise the defence of substantial impairment', as she has an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition that impaired her judgement, perception of events and capacity for self control."" 
        
       
      
    54 Dr Lisa Brown, a visiting psychiatrist at the Mulawa Women's Prison, has seen Mrs Richards on a number of occasions since her incarceration in that prison on 9 February 2001. Dr Brown said this: (p 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... Although she is now able to recognise the wrongfulness of her behaviour, it is my opinion, based on my contact with her, that Ms Richards was unable to recognise this at the time and that she acted on a firmly held belief that she and her children would be better off dead than to allow them to be at further risk of harm."" 
        
       
      
    55 Returning to the issue which I identified at the outset, namely, the moral culpability which attaches to Mrs Richards' actions, Mrs Richards was, in the unanimous view of these doctors, so substantially impaired that she might have raised the defence of insanity. She has, however, not done so. Rather, she has, as mentioned, raised, and the Crown has accepted, the partial defence of substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the impairment under which Mrs Richards laboured was so gross as almost to amount to insanity. 
     
      
    56 The dilemma which confronts a sentencing Judge in these circumstances, was eloquently described by Street CJ in R v Georgina Marie Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397, in these words: (at 402)  
     
      
       
        
        ""The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        In a case such as the present, where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life."" 
        
       
      
    57 A sentence ordinarily serves a number of objectives, one of which is deterrence, both of the individual and of the community. Here, I believe there is little need for personal deterrence so far as Mrs Richards is concerned. For the reasons I will provide shortly, the risk of re-offending is low. Her case, moreover, does not provide a suitable vehicle to deter the community at large (Scognamiglio v R (1991) 56 A Crim R 81). Barr J in R v Sette [2000] NSWSC 648, said this: (para 42) 
     
      
       
        
        ""42. A sentence can only have a deterrent effect to the community at large where the community can appreciate that there is a real degree of culpability on the part of the offender. Where the actions of the offender approach the morally innocent, little is demonstrated to the community by way of deterrence in the imposition of sentence."" 
        
       
       
      Prospects of Reoffending 
       
      
    58 Once the crisis was over, Mrs Richards quickly made significant progress in her mental health. The psychiatrist who saw her in prison, Dr Lisa Brown, furnished a report on 2 March 2001, which included the following: (Exhibit 1) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am not aware that she poses a risk to herself or to others if she were to be released on bail."" 
        
       
      
    59 Dr Nielssen described the nature of Mrs Richards' illness. His description provided some insight into the likely prognosis. It may be accepted that at least one of her children, and a neighbouring child, said things to her which suggested sexual abuse. The delusion which various doctors, including Dr Nielssen, diagnosed, had its source in the way in which Mrs Richards used this material, ultimately drawing the conclusion that both husbands were involved in a paedophile ring, as well as a neighbour. Mrs Richards, at the time that conclusion was drawn, had almost a decade of experience of living with Mr Duff and then Mr Richards. One assumes, since it was not mentioned, that nothing came to her notice in that time which suggested paedophile conduct on the part of either. This was the context within which she received accounts from a child who was then five and a half years old, and from another child a little older, but described as somewhat backward. Mrs Richards was right to take these accounts seriously. However, the accounts given by young children of such matters may be unreliable. Indeed, as Mrs Richards acknowledged, she recognised that aspects of her son's account were unreliable. She said this: (T 60) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... Braedy has made disclosures like 'He's putting sticks up my bottom'. I know that's not possible or otherwise his bottom would be bleeding, but I can only repeat what he told me."" 
        
       
      
    60 Nonetheless, recognising the unreliability of that aspect of her child's account did not shake Mrs Richards' faith in other aspects of the accusations which were made, first against Mr Mark Richards and then against Mr Anthony Duff. Nor did the rebuttal of at least part of these allegations, provided by her neighbour, undermine her faith in the account that she had been given. Likewise, the conclusions of the Joint Investigative Team offered her no solace. It is in this context that the doctors diagnosed delusions. She had a fixed belief, which in her mind was unshakeable.  
     
      
    61 Mrs Richards' prognosis, in these circumstances may, to a degree, depend upon the prominence which issues of child abuse have in her life in the future. When she saw Professor Quadrio, she thought that she might devote her time to exposing paedophile rings, and DOCS, whom she believed had let her down. Since these were the very things which triggered her delusions and the psychotic episode, and led to these crimes, that preoccupation, were it to occur, would be a matter of concern. 
     
      
    62 However, more recent evidence from Dr Nielssen, which I accept, and from Mrs Richards herself, suggests that the preoccupation has receded. She saw Dr Nielssen on 23 April 2002. Dr Nielssen reported on his examination as follows: (p 1) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In response to questions to establish her current beliefs, she answered that she had 'no desire to pursue it, as it would only harm the kids' and said 'I won't harp on it or do anything about it'. She said 'I would never be in that situation again ... what I did was in a state of panic ... I had no support from anyone'."" 
        
       
      
    63 Dr Nielssen therefore assessed Mrs Richards as presenting a relatively low risk of reoffending. He gave the following evidence: (T 17/18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In terms of the prediction of dangerousness itself as outlined in my report, it's not a very easy area to discuss based on scientific knowledge because the research is inconclusive and again it's very difficult to generalise research on groups of people to individuals, but having said that, I'd say that Ms Richards has a relatively low risk for the reasons that the situation in which the offence occurred is unlikely to recur and from what she's been through and the treatment she'd had and will likely to get will modify her response in future. Secondly, she's not a person who carries a high risk of violence or harm to others anyway, through having a history of anti-social or violent conduct or substance abuse leading to loss of control of behaviour. Thirdly, even though delusions are fixed they can respond to some extent to treatment, even just a counselling to, and I believe that she has gained some insight regarding what other people believe are delusional beliefs from the way she skirted around the subject during our interview when her current beliefs were very much an area of interest. ..."" 
        
       
      
    64 Dr Nielssen also gave the following evidence: (T 20/21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ...She hadn't previously had any exposure to counselling or care other than marital counselling and what sounded like an acute episode in her early adult life. I think she would handle things differently and I've previously given evidence on the risk being very much higher during the first episode if you like of mental illness as opposed to later episodes."" 
        
       
      
    65 Dr Nielssen elaborated upon the last answer in the following evidence: (T 21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... the first episode of psychotic illness prior to any contact with treating services carries a far higher risk than subsequent episodes and this is based on my own unpublished data but it's about a 40 fold higher risk."" 
        
       
      
    66 I accept this evidence. Mrs Richards, on the evidence, has made a very good recovery from her mental illness. I believe the prospects of rehabilitation to be excellent. I accept that, with appropriate treatment and supervision, Mrs Richards presents a low risk of reoffending. 
     
      
       
      The Subjective Case of Mrs Richards 
       
      
    67 Mrs Richards is a woman aged 39 years. She is intelligent, accomplished and refined. She gave evidence before me. She presented as an articulate and reasonable woman, who had plainly made a substantial recovery from the acute mental illness which afflicted her. 
     
      
    68 Mrs Richards was, on the evidence before me, a woman who was devoted to her children. Ms Patti Hammond, of the Probation and Parole Service, said this: (Exhibit D) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Enquiries revealed that Ms Richards is considered to be a well organised, capable, caring and devoted mother. She devoted time to her children and developed close relationships with them; she loved her children and they loved her."" 
        
       
      
    69 Mrs Richards has no previous convictions. She has been, throughout her incarceration, a model prisoner. I accept unreservedly that Mrs Richards suffers very significant remorse. 
     
      
    70 Mrs Richards acknowledged at once responsibility for her crimes. She pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, that is, once the Crown had accepted her plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. The sentence should be approached upon the basis of the maximum discount of 25% for an early plea of guilty (R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309). 
     
      
       
      The Appropriate Sentence 
       
      
    71 Mrs Richards entered custody on the day of the offences, 7 February 2001. She has remained in custody for a period exceeding 15 months. That custody has, in part, been the more onerous because her crimes involved a child, making it necessary that she be held on protection. 
     
      
    72 In fixing upon a sentence, it is necessary that separate sentences be identified in respect of each count. In determining such sentences I should have regard to the principle of totality, giving consideration at the same time as to whether the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative (Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610). 
     
      
    73 The task of fixing an appropriate sentence in this case is, for the reasons identified by Sir Laurence Street, not an easy one. The case, on any view, is most unusual. I have considered, as one of the many alternatives, a further custodial sentence. However, in the unusual circumstances of this case, and taking account of the 15 months that Mrs Richards has already served, I do not feel that a further sentence of full time custody is called for. 
     
      
    74 Rather, I believe that it is appropriate that Mrs Richards should enter a Good Behaviour Bond for a period of 5 years. Under Pt 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it is necessary that such a bond should contain a number of conditions. It is also necessary that I should explain those conditions to the person who is to be the subject of the bond, in this case Mrs Richards. 
     
      
    75 Here, it is appropriate, in my view, to impose conditions as to supervision. Recommendations have been made by various psychiatrists that Mrs Richards should be supervised and have counselling. Mrs Richards herself has said that she is anxious to have counselling. As a consequence of the conditions I intend to impose, she will be obliged to submit to psychiatric care, as directed by those responsible for her supervision. 
     
      
    76 Before passing sentence, it is perhaps appropriate that I should address some remarks to others affected by this tragedy. Mr Mark Richards has lost a precious daughter. He also has the torment of knowing what his son, Braedy, has been through. Mr Anthony Duff has the same torment in respect of Mahon. The families of both Mr Richards and Mr Duff have, no doubt, been affected, and affected profoundly. It is gratifying to see that neither child suffered physically. It is also encouraging that the Victim Impact Statement suggests that Mahon is now doing very well. 
     
      
    77 One can only hope that Mr Richards and Mr Duff approach the future with some appreciation of the vicious and unreasonable nature of mental illness, and the need for generosity and charity in their dealings with Mrs Richards, keeping at the forefront of their minds the paramount interests of the children. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    78 Raigan Frances Richards, I sentence you as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. In respect of the second count, the attempted murder of Mahon Richards, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment commencing on 7 February 2001, and expiring today, 17 May 2002. 
       
       
      2. In respect of the third count, the attempted murder of Braedy Richards, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment, concurrent with the previous term, commencing on 7 February 2001, and expiring today, 17 May 2002. 
       
       
      3. In respect of the offence of manslaughter, you are required to enter a Bond (under s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999), for a period of 5 years commencing today, 17 May 2002, and expiring on 16 May 2007; that Bond to include the following conditions: 
       
      
    · First, that you will appear before the Court, if called upon to do so, during the term of the Bond. 
     
      
    · Secondly, that you will be of good behaviour, and will inform the Registrar or the Clerk of the Court of any change of residential address. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, that within 24 hours of your release, you will report to the Adult Probation and Parole Service, at a location to be stipulated, and will submit to its supervision and directions during the term of your Bond. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, that you undertake such psychiatric care as the Adult Probation and Parole Service may arrange or direct. 
     
      
    79 The consequence of the imposition of these various conditions as part of the Bond is that if you fail to comply with them, or any of them, you may be brought back before the Court and sentenced according to law. The sentence that may be imposed may include a number of sanctions, including imprisonment. In the event that there is a breach of the Bond, a warrant may be issued for your arrest. The Court may, unless there are reasons excusing such breach, proceed to enforce the Bond in the ways which I have stipulated.

       Conviction appeal – s 61  
       Crimes Act 
        
       
     2 The applicant, Sondra Ann Fisher, appeals against her conviction for common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. She needs leave to appeal out of time and, accepting the reasons advanced by her counsel, I see no reason why leave should not be granted. She also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed on her in the District Court by O’Reilly DCJ on 9 February 2001.3 In relation to the s 61 offence of common assault, the appellant had pleaded guilty and was committed for sentence. The plea was affirmed in the District Court together with a plea of guilty to eight other offences. In total there were five counts of break, enter and steal; two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (both with respect to the same victim) and one count of escape from lawful custody, in addition to the common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act. Matters comprising six further offences were also taken into account on two Form 1s.4 With respect to the common assault count, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to commence from 1 August 2000, but this was subsumed into the other sentences which I will detail later.5 The appellant submits that the District Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the charge of common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act because of s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is submitted that s 8 operates to require that the offence must be dealt with summarily. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Corish submits that s 61 of the Crimes Act is no longer to be characterised as an indictable offence. I should mention that the relevant offence, admitted by the appellant, was an assault on Teresa Kelly on 27 January 2000. 6 An indictable offence is one that may be prosecuted on indictment; see definition in s 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. There is also a definition of indictable offence in s 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987. 7 The appellant relies upon s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides that the following offences must be dealt with summarily: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) an offence that under this or any other Act is required to be dealt with summarily, 
          
          
         (b) an offence that under this or any other Act is described as a summary offence, 
         
         
          
         (c) an offence (not being an offence that under this or any other Act is required to be dealt with on indictment) for which the maximum penalty that may be imposed is not, and does not include, imprisonment for more that 2 years. 
          
         
        
       
     8 In particular, reliance is placed upon sub-para (c). Common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and it is submitted that it is not an offence which is required to be dealt with on indictment.9 Section 8 in its current form commenced to operate on 1 January 2000. Prior to that date the appellant accepts that a s 61 common assault offence could be dealt with on indictment if the prosecutor so elected. See s 20(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act and Table 2 to Schedule 1 of the Act. 
      
       
     10 However, it is submitted, that this procedure is no longer available. Since the amendment commenced to s 8, common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act can no longer be described as an offence which may be prosecuted on indictment. 11 What should also be noted concerning the relevant legislation in Division 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act is that the division is headed ‘Summary Disposal of Indictable Offences By Local Courts’. Section 18 contains the objects of the Division and refers to Tables of indictable offences to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor elects otherwise. 12 Section 18(b) refers to Table 2 in Schedule 1 to the Act. This Table is headed ‘Indictable offences that are to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects otherwise’. The Table includes a reference to s 61 of the Crimes Act, the offence of common assault. 13 Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act is relevant and in ss (2) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         An indictable offence listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecuting authority elects in accordance with this Division to have the offence dealt with on indictment. 
         
        
       
     14 Turning to the Crimes Act, it may be noted that s 61 is headed ‘Common assault prosecuted by indictment’. When s 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act was amended, no change was made to the form of s 61 of the Crimes Act, such as to change or delete the header. More importantly, no change was made so as to delete the reference to s 61 of the Crimes Act from Table 2 of Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act.15 In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant accepts that these matters present some difficulties for his argument but submits that provision in s 8 (1)(c) is unambiguous.  
      
       
     16 Section 35 of the Interpretation Act provides that ‘Headings to a part, division or sub-division of an Act and to a Schedule to an Act, shall be taken to be part of the Act’. 
      
       
     17 It is the submission on behalf of the respondent that Parliament has indicated that, subject to s 20, the offence of common assault is to be tried on indictment. 18 Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act refers to the objects of the division and includes the preservation of jurisdiction to deal with the offence of common assault on indictment. Section 33 of the Interpretation Act provides that an interpretation which would promote the purpose or object underlying an Act is to be preferred to one which does not. 19 There are other provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which should also be noted, in particular s 7(2) and s 20(2). They refer to the continuing jurisdiction to deal with certain offences on indictment.20 If the submission of the appellant is correct, then it seems that s 8(1)(c) would give s 20 and Table 2 in Schedule 1 relating, for example, to common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act, little or no practicable field of operation. 21 For my part I accept and prefer the submission of the respondent that the courts should strive to give each of the two provisions a field of operation on the basis that it is unlikely to have been the parliamentary intention to include a provision in an enactment which has virtually no practicable effect. 22 A reasonable result should be sought by the courts consistent with proper construction. In my opinion, that can readily be achieved by treating the expression in s 8(1)(c) ‘required to be dealt with on indictment’ as subject to s 20 of the Act. If Parliament had intended by the amendment of s 8 that common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act no longer be prosecuted on indictment, it would have been a simple matter to have removed the heading to s 61 of the Crimes Act and also to remove the reference to s 61 from the Table to the Criminal Procedure Act.  
      
       
     23 That Parliament did not see fit to do so supports the respondent’s analysis of the legislation and the submission that s 8 did not intend to remove common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act from being prosecuted on indictment. In my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Sentence appeal 
       
     24 I turn, therefore, to the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against sentence. The total effective sentence imposed upon the applicant was six years imprisonment commencing on 2 August 2000 and concluding on 1 August 2006. A non-parole period was fixed for three years and the applicant is not eligible to apply for parole until 1 August 2003.25 There are two bases submitted in support of the application. First, one of parity with the co-offender and, secondly, a submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
      
       
     26 The sentences imposed on the applicant were as follows: For three break, enter and steal offences the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of six years to commence on 2 August 2000 and expire on 1 August 2006 with a non-parole period of three years to expire on 1 August 2003. For the two other break, enter and steal offences, the applicant was also sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two and a half years to commence on 2 August 2000 and expire on 1 February 2003. The applicant was also sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences - there were two of them - to commence on 2 August 2000 and expire on 1 August 2003, and she was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment for the common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act and the escape from lawful custody. They were also to commence on 1 August 2000. 
      
       
     27 In his Honour’s judgment on sentence and in the Crown’s submissions in summary of the trial, the bare facts of each of the offences are set forth and I will not take time now to reiterate them. In his reasons for sentence the learned sentencing judge outlined what he regarded as the appropriate sentences for each matter if they had been dealt with in isolation. These are set out in his Honour’s reasons for sentence. 28 His Honour then totalled the sentences and, having regard to the pleas of guilty entered and adhered to by the applicant, to the principle of totality and the subjective features of the case, concluded that the overall appropriate sentence was six years. 29 As to the parity argument, the applicant relies on the sentencing of the co-offender on the break, enter and steals. He was originally sentenced to three years and on a re-sentencing, because he failed the programme set for him in the Drug Court, he was on 19 December 2001 sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year and eight months set. 30 The applicant’s counsel relies on the disparity between the sentences imposed on the co-offender and the sentence indication for the applicant. He submits that this would lead to the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance that she was dealt with much more harshly than her co-offender, Mr Jackson.31 In my view the parity argument fails. There is no doubt, and I do not think it is disputed, that the offences of the applicant were serious and aggravated by being committed while she was on parole. Her criminal record included offences of break, enter and steal, robbery and an offence of violence. In addition to the nine offences for which she was sentenced, six other matters were to be taken into account on two Form 1s before the Court. 
      
       
     32 The nine offences included two very serious assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, as well as the common assault under s 61, which in itself was quite serious on its facts. Therefore, the imposition of a substantial sentence of imprisonment was required. 
      
       
     33 The big difference between the offences for which the applicant was sentenced as compared to the co-offender, was that he did not face any charges of assault. His Honour indicated that the largest penalty was attracted by the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which was the most serious offence. The injuries occasioned by the applicant to the victim were severe and his Honour rejected the applicant’s expression of contrition, as he was entitled to do. 34 In my opinion, it cannot be concluded that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance at the lesser penalty imposed on the co-offender. 35 The second aspect of the application for leave to appeal against sentence is the contention that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive. Bearing in mind the number of offences and their nature there was an infinite number of possible permutations which the sentencing judge could have alighted upon in the sentencing process. It may be that the way his Honour structured the sentence could be seen to be unconventional or in breach of R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57. 36 However, when one examines each individual offence and possible alternative structuring of the sentences, it must involve an accumulation. Accumulation itself presents difficulties and problems. In my view, the Court should not proceed to re-sentence the applicant principally because the total or overall sentence imposed by his Honour of six years, with a non-parole period of three years backdated as it was to 2 August 2000, (which was a lenient thing for his Honour to do) means that it has not been shown that a lesser sentence is warranted by law. 
      
       
     37 In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 the Court addressed s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and in particular Spigelman CJ had something to say about the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In para 79 of the judgment the Chief Justice said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: 'If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.’ That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed'. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore’ is not satisfied. 
         
        
        
       
     38 Sully J was of a like view in the remarks that he made. See also R v Cook [2002] NSWCCA 140 at para 20. 39 In my opinion, when one examines the facts of the offences and all of the other relevant circumstances which must be taken into account, it cannot be concluded that some other sentence or a lesser sentence than passed is warranted in law and should have been passed. It seems to me that it cannot be said that the sentences were manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal against sentence and dismiss the appeal against the conviction on the common assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act.40 KIRBY J: I agree.41 CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree.42 STEIN JA: Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be as I have just announced.

     3 CARRUTHERS AJ: Alan Douglas Channell appeals against his conviction at the Sydney District Court on 27 April 2000 on one count of indecent assault of a male person contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act 1900, which section has since been repealed. 
      
       
     4 On 16 June 2000 his Honour Andrew ADCJ sentenced the appellant to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to be served from 16 June 2000 and to expire on 15 June 2001. 
      
       
     5 On 17 April 2001 the appellant was arraigned before his Honour Andrew ADCJ and a jury of twelve at the District Court Sydney upon an indictment which contained four counts, namely, that he: 
      
       
       1. Between 26 August 1978 and 31 December 1979 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, indecently did assault David Glen Johnson, a male person. 
        
       2. Between 26 August 1978 and 31 December 1979 at Sydney in the ,State of New South Wales, indecently did assault David Glen Johnson, a male person. 
        
       3. Between 26 August 1978 and 31 December 1979 near Trangie in the State of New South Wales, indecently did assault David Glen Johnson, a male person. 
        
       4. Between 26 August 1978 and 31 December 1979 at Orange in the State of New South Wales, did commit with David Glen Johnson the crime of buggery. 
        
       
     6 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. At the conclusion of the Crown case leave was given to extend the period during which these offences were alleged to have occurred by 12 months, that is to say to 31 December 1980. 
      
       
     7 His Honour directed a verdict of not guilty in relation to count 4. This was because the complainant in cross-examination maintained that the alleged buggery did not occur at Orange but instead at Fairfield, Sydney. 
      
       
     8 With regard to the remaining three counts of indecent assault of a male person, the jury found the appellant not guilty on counts 1 and 2 and guilty on count 3. Thus, the appellant appeals only against the conviction on count 3. 
      
       
     9 By reason of the way this appeal was conducted it is necessary only to refer briefly to the factual aspects. The Crown relied upon the evidence of David Glen Johnson, the complainant, born on 26 August 1969. In essence the complainant alleged that whilst he and his brother Peter were residents of Dunmore House, an institution for disadvantaged children, the appellant took them out on weekends, sexually abusing him on four of these occasions. The complainant said that all the offences had occurred whilst he had lived at Dunmore House. He did not live there after early 1980. 
      
       
     10 The complainant gave evidence that he was first taken to the appellant’s Fairfield flat in 1978. That night while he was having a shower the appellant fondled his penis. That matter formed the basis of count 1 in the indictment. An incident when the appellant masturbated the complainant, allegedly occurred on the following night. This formed the basis of count 2. 
      
       
     11 Count 3 was an allegation that whilst on a visit to Trangie, the appellant masturbated him. The fourth count involved an allegation that whilst on a camping trip at Orange, the appellant had anal intercourse with the complainant. 
      
       
     12 This was the third time the matters had come for trial, two earlier trials having to be aborted in January 2000. 
      
       
     13 The complainant in evidence stated that various other offences than those that formed the basis of the indictment were committed by the appellant upon him. For example, on the first day of the trial he stated that the episode at Trangie involved both masturbation on the part of the appellant and the insertion of a finger into the complainant’s bottom. At various times during his testimony other allegations were made including penile anal intercourse at Trangie; oral intercourse at Trangie; oral intercourse at Orange; finger in the backside at Orange and buggery at Fairfield.  
      
       
     14 None of these allegations was opened on or led by the Crown; they were volunteered by the complainant. They formed no part of the Crown case and as it transpired his Honour gave no direction to the jury in relation to the allegations of uncharged sexual misconduct. I might add that neither the Crown counsel or counsel for the defence asked his Honour to give the appropriate directions. 
      
       
     15 Counsel for the appellant sought to cross-examine the complainant with regard to his criminal record. It would appear that the complainant was serving a significant sentence for sexual assault. The judge refused to allow cross-examination on the complainant's record on the basis that it lacked substantive probative value. 
      
       
     16 At the conclusion of the Crown case Mr Walsh, who appeared for the appellant, informed the judge that despite the fact the prosecution now relied on evidence the appellant had been living during the relevant period in a flat at Fairfield, in an earlier trial with a different complainant the Crown had relied upon the fact that during the same period the appellant had been living in Ingleburn. 
      
       
     17 Applications for a permanent stay and verdict by direction were made. They were refused, although on reconsideration, a verdict of not guilty on count 4 was directed. The trial judge also gave the Crown leave to amend the indictment extending the period over which the offences were said to have occurred to December 1980, an extension of 12 months. 
      
       
     18 The appellant gave evidence denying each of the offences. Effectively, the case went to the jury as one of word against word, there being only minimal evidence available to support the evidence of the complainant. Perhaps this was due to the large lapse of time between the alleged offences and the trial. Whatever the reason that is how the matter went to the jury. 
      
       
     19 The following relevant grounds of appeal were filed: 
      
       
       1. The verdict of guilty was unreasonable and cannot stand, having regard, in particular, to the circumstances of the trial in which there were inconsistent verdicts. 
        
       2. The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct or warn the jury as to the impact of any reasonable doubt arising as to the complainant’s evidence as to one count upon a proper assessment of the complainant’s evidence in relation to other counts. 
        
       3. The learned trial judge erred in failing to warn or instruct the jury as to the manner in which evidence of sexual misconduct, not the subject of counts on the indictment, should be approached. 
        
       
     20 Counts 4, 5 and 6 were not pursued on the appeal. 
      
       
     21 Mr Dawe of Queen’s Counsel for the Crown has approached this appeal with his customary frankness and fairness. In these circumstances it is only necessary to refer with brevity to the various grounds of appeal. Before I do that, perhaps I should mention that the difficulties associated with the conduct of a criminal trial in this State involving lengthy delay between the date of the alleged sexual offences and the hearing, have most recently been dealt with by this Court in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60, (Wood CJ at CL, Sully and Dowd JJ). Those judgments were handed down on 12 April 2002. 
      
       
     22 BWT was specifically concerned with the question whether the learned trial judge had given a warning which was sufficient to comply with the principles enunciated by the High Court in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 as reinforced by Bramton v The Queen (2000) 176 ALR 369 and Doggett v The Queen (2001) 182 ALR 1. In particular in BWT Sully J sets out in great detail at para 95 the principles which were, in his Honour’s view, to be distilled from the three cases to which I have just made reference. These principles received the approval of the other two judges. 
      
       
     23 That paragraph is too lengthy to be repeated here and it is unnecessary to do so, but it will no doubt, if I may respectfully say so, provide considerable assistance to other judges and counsel in future cases of this nature. 
      
       
     24 In the instant case at the conclusion of his Honour’s summing-up, only one redirection was sought by counsel. Mr Walsh sought, without objection from the Crown Prosecutor, a redirection based upon Longman. His Honour gave a redirection, but if I may respectfully say so, giving full weight to the submissions on behalf of the Crown, it did not in my respectful view fully satisfy the demanding warning required to satisfy the principles required by the Longman line of cases. 
      
       
     25 Turning to ground 2, as I have indicated, no direction was sought by either counsel with regard to the impact of any reasonable doubt arising as to the complainant’s evidence as to one count, upon a proper assessment of the complainant’s evidence in relation to the other counts. It would have been most desirable that the jury be instructed that if they held a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his evidence in relation to the other counts. 
      
       
     26 In this regard see R v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 59 para 9 and R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443 paras 12 and 13. I would propose that leave be granted to the applicant to rely on this ground, albeit it was not raised at trial. It was certainly a direction that was required by reason of the lack of real corroborative evidence of the complainant. I would therefore propose that ground 2 be upheld. 
      
       
     27 As to ground 3 the omission by his Honour to direct the jury as to the manner in which the evidence of sexual misconduct, not the subject of the counts on indictment, should be approached was unquestionably a fatal defect in this trial. 
      
       
     28 One only needs to refer to cases such as R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 516; R v Greenham [1999] NSWCCA 8 at paras 22-23, and R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702. It goes without saying the jury may have impermissibly treated the evidence as tendency or coincidence evidence within the meaning of Pt 3.6 of the Evidence Act 1995. That would, of course, have created a manifest injustice. 
      
       
     29 In my view the appellant should be granted leave to argue ground of appeal 3 and I would propose that that ground be upheld. 
      
       
     30 As to the first ground, the Crown has realistically accepted the fact that this case fell clearly within the principles enunciated by the High Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. One, of course, now reads the judgment of the High Court in Jones in the light of the judgment of this Court in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290. Having said that, however, this case is a classic Jones situation. 
      
       
     31 Given the jury’s findings upon the first and second counts it was not open to them on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the third count. The quality of the complainant’s evidence upon the third count was no higher than that upon the first and second counts. Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the first and second counts lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown’s case on the third count wore a different complexion for it meant that when his evidence could be set against other reliable evidence it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. Thus, I would propose that the first ground of appeal be upheld. 
      
       
     32 The effect of the upholding of the first ground of appeal is of itself sufficient to lead this Court to an order that there be a verdict of acquittal on the third count. However, for the sake of completion it should be noted that at the time of sentence by Andrew DCJ in relation to the subject matter, the appellant was already serving sentences imposed upon him for indecent assault and buggery at the Dubbo District Court on 8 September 1999. Those sentences were to date from 23 August 1999 and expire by way of minimum term on 22 September 2004. Thus the sentence imposed by Andrew ADCJ was to be served concurrently with those sentences and has thus been served. 
      
       
     33 I would propose therefore that the appeal against conviction be upheld, the conviction on the third count quashed, and that this Court enter on the third count a verdict of acquittal. 
      
       
     34 STEIN JA: Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be as enunciated.

      Regina v Michael John Walker 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 O’Keefe J:  
      
       
        
       BACKGROUND 
        
       
     2 This is an application by Michael John Walker (“the Applicant”) for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court following a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 20 years. The Applicant asked the Court to take into account an offence of using a prohibited weapon, namely a replica pistol. However as this was the weapon referred to in the charge to which the Applicant pleaded guilty, the judge took the view that the facts relating to the matter on the Schedule were entirely subsumed by the facts of the armed robbery. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for six years from 3 August 2001, with a non-parole period of three years and six months, so that the earliest date on which the applicant would become eligible to be released on parole is 2 February 2005.  
      
       
     3 The application for Leave to Appeal is based upon one ground only, namely that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. There was no challenge to the facts found by the sentencing judge, nor was it suggested that any element relevant to the fixing of the term of the sentence had been omitted from consideration. 
      
       
        
       FACTS 
        
       
     4 On 19 February 2001, a 17 year old schoolboy was sitting at a bus stop with his girlfriend. He had with him a mobile phone on which he had just completed a call. Having done so, he placed the mobile phone back in his schoolbag. Thereupon the applicant approached the schoolboy and his girlfriend, pointed a replica pistol at the boy’s chest, and began to search through his schoolbag, which had been on the ground near the victim’s feet. The boy believed that the gun was real and so allowed the Applicant to take his mobile phone from the schoolbag and make off with it. 
      
       
     5 The offence was witnessed by an off-duty police officer, who also believed that the replica pistol was real. Because of this, he did not seek to intervene in what was occurring or had occurred. Prudently, he called for assistance from other police, who attended promptly. The Applicant was located at a nearby shop and arrested. The replica pistol was found on him, but the mobile phone was not recovered. 
      
       
     6 The Applicant was charged and indicated before the Magistrate that he proposed to plead guilty.  
      
       
     7 The Applicant was born on 28 July 1968. Thus at the time of the offence he was 32 years of age. He has a reasonably extensive criminal record dating back to 1985. It includes seven convictions for assault, six convictions for matters of dishonestly, and three convictions for robbery with actual violence, steal from the person and robbery. The three last mentioned matters are of more recent occurrence. In the past, he has been given a recognizance on five occasions, a suspended sentence on another, and a bond on yet another occasion.  
      
       
     8 On 19 February 2001 the Applicant was the subject of a suspended sentence which was imposed on him for an offence of robbery with actual violence. He was also on parole for offences of stealing from the person and robbery; indeed, he had been released on parole on 28 December 2000. This means that the offence the subject of the present application was committed less than eight weeks after his release on parole.  
      
       
     9 The Applicant gave evidence that he was affected by drugs at the time of commission of the relevant offence. This is significant since leniency had been extended to him by the court on a previous occasion. This led to the Applicant attending The Glen (rehabilitation centre), but before he had finished the rehabilitation course, he went absent without leave and apparently did not complete the course. 
      
       
     10 The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence imposed was in excess of that referred to in the guideline judgment of Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In that case, a specially constituted Court of Criminal Appeal laid down guidelines for sentences for armed robbery under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, where certain features were present. These were seven in number. And importantly included that the offender is young, and had little or no criminal history. The situation of the Applicant in the present case is clearly distinguishable and Her Honour accurately distinguished Regina v Henry (supra). Furthermore, in Regina v Henry (supra) it was made clear that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Guidelines are not rules of universal application. They may be departed from where the justice of a particular case requires such departure.” (supra at 357) 
         
        
       
     11 This statement echoes what was said by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “… guidelines are intended to be indicative only. They are not intended to be applied in every case as if they were rules binding on sentencing judges. Decisions of appellate courts on sentencing are not to be treated as binding precedents.” (supra at 220) 
         
        
       
     12 Her Honour’s remarks on sentence recognise the foregoing principles. In this regard, it should be noted that as well as distinguishing Regina v Henry (supra) by reference to the age and criminal history of the Applicant, she had regard to the fact, in favour of the applicant, that the weapon used was not a knife, but rather a replica pistol. Its use was nonetheless such as to give rise to a terrifying experience for the young victim, who believed the weapon was genuine. It must also have been terrifying for the young girl who was in his company. 
      
       
     13 In her Remarks on Sentence, a full discount of 25% was allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea, but her Honour was guarded in relation to the prospects of the Applicant undertaking successful rehabilitation in relation to his drug dependency. In the light of the Applicant’s history and record there was good reason for caution by her Honour. 
      
       
     14 Counsel for the Applicant referred to a number of cases, details of which were set out in a schedule to her written submissions. Various comparisons and distinctions were made in support of the submission that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. However, an examination of his case shows that there is no case which is on all fours with the instant case. In addition, in the present case the age of the offender, the fact of his long and escalating criminal history in terms of the gravity of the offences committed, and the aggravating feature that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was at liberty for three offences (two of which were of a nature similar to that the subject of the present application) were features which justified a sentence above the range identified in Regina v Henry (supra) and an examination of the cases in the schedule reveals that there is no case which is on al fours with the instant case. 
      
       
     15 In Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1997-1998) 164 CLR 465, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The antecedent criminal history is relevant … to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration, or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence, a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity, or shows a need to impose condine punishment to deter the offence and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” (supra at 477) 
         
        
       
     16 This statement has application in the present case and gives an additional basis of support for a penalty greater than that referred to in Regina v Henry (supra). 
      
       
     17 An examination of the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission does not, in my opinion, make good the argument on behalf of the Applicant that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. For example, they show that in cases where there is only one count, there has been a plea of guilty, and the offence had been committed whilst the offender was on bail or on a bond, 24% of the sentences were six years or more.  
      
       
     18 The Remarks on Sentence show that her Honour carefully considered the particular case, its seriousness, relevant surrounding features, all subjective matters pertaining to the Applicant. She then came to her conclusion as to the sentence that was warranted. Particular regard was given to the non-parole period. 
      
       
     19 When these factors are looked at, I am of opinion that the submission that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive is not correct. In my opinion, the sentence imposed by Her Honour was within the range appropriate to the particular offence and the sentence determined by her was warranted. 
      
       
     20 In my opinion, the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed, and I would propose that the court order accordingly. 
      
       
     21 SMART AJ : I agree. 
      
       
     22 O’KEEFE J : The order of the court will be that the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

       INTRODUCTION 
        
       
     1 This is an application by Trung Quach (the Applicant) pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act) for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 1 August 2001 following the conviction of the applicant by a jury on a count of having caused grievous bodily harm to his wife with intent to murder her on 25 July 2000.  
      
       
     2 The offence for which the Applicant was convicted carries a maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment (s.27 Crimes 1900). His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of nine years to commence on 22 May 2001 and to expire on 21 May 2010. A non-parole period of five years was fixed to begin on the same date as the sentence and to expire on 21 May 2006. Special circumstances were found by his Honour. 
      
       
     3 At the hearing of this application, counsel for the Applicant relied upon four bases, namely that the sentencing Judge : 
      
       
        
       (i) had not taken account of the previous good character of the Applicant when fixing the sentence; 
        
        
       (ii) had not dealt with or had regard to the contrition of the Applicant; 
        
        
       (iii) had not dealt with or taken into account a depressive illness from which the Applicant was said to be suffering at the time of committing the offence in question; 
        
        
       (iv) imposed a sentence which was in any event manifestly excessive.  
        
       
     4 The Applicant had no prior convictions and until the attack on his wife, as his Honour said, he appeared to be: 
      
       
        
         
          “a normal law-abiding member of the community with a good job and family … hard working … anxious to provide adequately for his family … who after arriving as a refugee and with little material possessions … focussed himself to achieve and perform, pushed himself to achieve and perform. There was no history of violent behaviour and no history of substance abuse by the applicant.” 
         
        
        
       FACTS 
        
       
     5 The Applicant and his wife, the victim, were both Vietnamese who had come to Australia under difficult circumstances. However, they married in 1988 and two male children were born of the marriage. They were aged 10 or 11 and 6 years respectively at the time of the trial and sentence. 
      
       
     6 The Applicant was born on 29 September 1957 and was thus almost 44 years of age at the time he was sentenced. He is an intelligent man. He had successfully completed a degree in mathematics at Wollongong University in 1984 and had commenced an honours degree in statistics. However, he discontinued this course because of employment opportunities that opened up. He worked as a statistician, then as a computer analyst for a large company, a bank and a major insurance company. He later became a computer consultant and programmer for a number of significant companies and was so employed at the time of the events which led to his conviction and sentence. In the prison he commenced a Masters Degree in Business Administration by correspondence through the University of Southern Queensland. 
      
       
     7 From about 1995 the Applicant began to suspect that his wife was having an extra marital affair. This suspicion was without foundation. The fact was that she was not having such an affair. However, he became increasingly suspicious and by 23 July 2000 claims he was convinced that his wife was seeing another man. He claims to have found the situation of the marriage stressful, the more so since his wife had suggested that their marriage was breaking up. However, notwithstanding this the building of a new home was undertaken. This itself was said to be a source of stress, particularly as the family lived in temporary accommodation. What this accommodation was and whether such accommodation was unsuitable is not clear from the evidence.  
      
       
     8 At around 11 a.m. on 25 July 2000 Mrs Quach was lying on the bed of the matrimonial home when the Applicant came into the room. She thought he was going to talk to her but instead she felt a blow to her head and saw that the Applicant was holding a green bottle in his hand. She was struck several times with this implement, mainly on the head and whilst the attack proceeded the Applicant told his wife that he wanted to kill her because, it seemed, she did not respect him. The applicant’s wife struggled and sought to escape. However, the Applicant gagged her by sticking a rag in her mouth. He then tied her legs and later her hands. As this proceeded the applicant was threatening to kill her and then himself. At this time the two boys were at school. 
      
       
     9 The attack on Mrs Quach led to her losing a good deal of blood. The Applicant washed the walls and the bed clothes and clothing, no doubt in an endeavour to conceal what had happened. He then left his wife tied up in the room. During the course of the day she tried to get to a phone but he intercepted her, pulled the phone from the wall and thereafter put her back in another room, checking on her regularly during the course of the day. 
      
       
     10 Mrs Quach apparently lapsed into unconsciousness at some stage. Whilst she was unconscious the Applicant collected the two children of the marriage from school and brought them home. She recovered consciousness and when she tried to get out of the room she made a noise which attracted the children. When they found her she was covered in blood. Apparently they convinced the Applicant to call an ambulance, but since this did not occur until about 6 p.m. it must have taken some time after their return from school for them to convince him to call for medical help for their mother. 
      
       
     11 When the police and ambulance arrived Mrs Quach had been effectively held prisoner for several hours, had lost a lot of blood. She was found to have sustained a fractured skull and other injuries as a result of the attack on her by the Applicant. 
      
       
     12 The Applicant was arrested later on the night of 25 July 2000, at which time there was evidence that he may have attempted suicide by taking a number of tablets. A suicide note had been written by him. 
      
       
     13 Although the Applicant gave no evidence at the trial his defence was that the attack had been committed under the effect of sane automatism – a proposition which the jury rejected by its verdict. He claimed that he had little, if any, recollection of the events of the day of 25 July 2000 although when he attended at the hospital he was able to give a history of the events of the day. 
      
       
        
       SENTENCE 
        
       
     14 In imposing the sentence his Honour detailed the events of 25 July 2000, adverted to a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service and referred to evidence from a Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr Teoh, who had been seeing the applicant from a date shortly after he had been taken into custody. 
      
       
     15 His Honour then considered the seriousness of the offence viewed in the context of the circumstances before and after its commission. He indicated that the offence was very serious because the conviction involved an actual intention to kill. He then balanced the demands of justice and of society on the one hand with the need to deal with the Applicant in his personal situation and imposed the sentence referred to in paragraph 2 above. 
      
       
        
       CHALLENGES TO THE SENTENCE 
        
        
       As to (i): 
        
       
     16 The first claim on behalf of the Applicant that his Honour did not take into account the good character of the applicant in fixing the sentence is inconsistent with the Remarks on Sentence. Not only did his Honour advert to the matters of good character referred to above, but he specifically examined the weight which should be given to good character in the context of the serious offence and the behaviour of the applicant in relation to his wife, behaviour which he described as “quite outrageous”.  
      
       
        
       His Honour’s reasoning in relation to good character was challenged. In the course of those reasons he said: 
        
        
         
         “We must all accept the fact that differences in marriages do occur and it is expected that people will try and resolve any differences without violence. However to go to the stage of wanting to end the marriage by killing someone is quite unacceptable of course and quite frightening to the wider community. There can be no mitigating factors in such an act with that intention. We do accept the realities of marriages breaking up and people separating but we can never accept or tolerate any person killing someone as the solution. And so it is difficult with reference to a person being a man of good character up until now. It is difficult to know what relevance that has where a person has considered the final solution.” 
         
        
       
     17 In my opinion the foregoing passage is un-exceptional. It does not form a proper or adequate basis for challenge to the sentence imposed. However, it was then argued that the following passage indicated error: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fact is that at the start of the assault that morning the prisoner did state and evidence an intention to kill. Such an expression and intention must immediately negate any consideration of mitigating factors because of good character, then to extend the trauma and terror of the assault all day until the late afternoon takes the actions of the prisoner into a further level of callousness.” 
         
        
       
     18 When read together with and in the context of the rest of the Remarks on Sentence, the passages referred to in paragraphs 16 and 17 above are an expression by his Honour of the difficulties confronting a court which has to consider the appropriate sentence to impose for a serious and terrible crime of the kind of which the Applicant had been convicted, when the convicted person has been of previous good character. 
      
       
     19 There is nothing wrong with a judge discussing the weight which should be given to the previous good character of an offender. This is occasionally described as “otherwise good character.” However a proper reading of the judge’s remarks indicates that he has excluded the applicant’s previous good character as a mitigating factor and therefore has not taken it into consideration in mitigation of the penalty. In this respect, he has erred: (Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21). Giving little weight to the applicant’s previous good character in the light of the savagery of the attack, the intent to murder and the failure to summon medical help for some hours, and then only after being pressed by the children, could be understood. Not taking good character into account at all constitutes error. 
      
       
     20 The sentence imposed by the judge and the non-parole period were very lenient given the objective gravity of the offence and taking into account the subjective features of the applicant. Given that the judge erred in the manner referred to above, a lesser sentence and non-parole period shorter than that imposed by the judge would not have been appropriate. 
      
       
     21 It was further submitted that his Honour should have taken into account the question of retrograde amnesia in fixing the sentence. The Remarks on Sentence advert to this matter. However there is no express acceptance of it. Indeed the context in which it is referred to does not find that it existed as a fact or to the extent claimed. An examination of the transcript of the sentence hearing in which the recollection of the Applicant appears to be uneven and in which he appears to be able to remember some things favourable to himself but not things unfavourable, may be the basis on which his Honour refrained from making an affirmative finding in relation to retrograde amnesia. In the circumstances not doing so does not involve error. 
      
       
     22 In my opinion the ground of appeal (i) fails. 
      
       
        
       As to (ii) 
        
       
     23 There is no finding by his Honour that the Applicant was genuinely contrite. Whilst it is true that there is no finding that he was not, it is a matter on which a prisoner has an onus, albeit only on the balance of probabilities. Whilst the Applicant used words of contrition to his wife, e.g.: 
      
       
        
         
         “He said that he didn’t have enough words to tell me how sorry he is right now, that he was more – he was worry (sic) about my injury…” 
         
        
        
       and repeated almost the same words in the evidence he gave at the sentence hearing, such evidence was, on its face, somewhat hedged.  
        
       
     24 First, as I have already said, he claimed that the memory of the events was patchy. He remembered some favourable things but said he was quite unable to remember unfavourable things although he was asked about a number of them. Second, although he accepted the statement of the events as made by his wife, he did this on the basis that he “could not question or dispute that”. His approach was to “take (it) as given”. When he was asked directly about admitting what he had done his answer was less than forthcoming.  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Sir, are you still not prepared to admit that you intentionally inflicted the injury on your wife? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I have been looking for an answer in search of why, why I did on that day. I must admit through meditation I have been trying to search my self conscience. I want an answer. I want to know why I did. I mean  
         if 
           
         I had done that 
          with intention I would have accepted it. To this day to tell the truth I cant remember the word that I said to Ashley during those times.” (Italics added.) 
         
        
       
     25 Third, when asked about pulling the phone from the wall to prevent his wife calling for help, the Applicant’s answer was much the same and he sought to excuse his actions by saying : 
      
       
        
         
         “Any actions that were deemed as not compassionate I don’t know.” 
         
        
       
     26 Fourth, he persisted in his denial of recollection notwithstanding that he had been able to tell psychiatrists at the hospital to which he was admitted on the evening of 25 July, 2000, what had happened. He denied that he could remember having done so. 
      
       
     27 In these circumstances it ought not to be assumed that the judge accepted on the balance of probabilities that the Applicant was truly contrite in relation to what he had done and the absence of an affirmative finding in relation to contrition should not therefore be regarded as a matter overlooked by his Honour. I am certainly not satisfied that it was. 
      
       
     28 The fact that he expressed contrition to his wife and that she said that she forgave him did not detract from the duty of the judge to impose a proper sentence. Her views in relation to the contrition of the Applicant, as opposed to what he said to her, do not seem to have been tested. Furthermore, even the stated acceptance by the victim of her acceptance of her attacker’s contrition does not bind the court, nor does it detract from the need to give proper weight to the principle of general deterrence, Regina v Kanj [2000] NSWCCA 408, a principle that is important in cases of domestic violence (Regina v Green [2001] NSWCCA 258; Regina v Glen [1994] NSWCCA unreported 19 December 1994). Furthermore, the fact that a victim may forgive her attacker is not determinative. Indeed, its weight in relation to general deterrence will be a variable depending on the offence and the circumstances. It is a matter for judgment by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     29 In my opinion ground (ii) fails. 
      
       
        
       As to (iii) 
        
       
     30 Neither of the psychiatric reports tendered on behalf of the Applicant expresses a view as to causal relationship between any depressive illness of the Applicant and the offence for which he was convicted. Whilst Dr Teoh noted that the Applicant “has been feeling depressed whilst in prison” and that two days before the attack he felt “anxious and agitated because he suspected that his wife could have been seeing another man” and whilst he also noted that the Applicant said that he ”remembered feeling ‘tormented’, ‘confused’” and that he felt “helpless” with “anxiety symptoms”, Dr Teoh does not express an opinion that such symptoms or depression were in fact the cause of the offence committed. The highest that he puts it is that these factors, together with sleep deprivation and the effects of nicotine and caffeine “could have made him confused and disinhibited.” (emphasis added) . 
      
       
     31 The forensic psychologist whose report was tendered, whilst diagnosing a longstanding major depressive disorder, expressed no opinion as to any causal relation between the disorder diagnosed and the offence committed by the Applicant. 
      
       
     32 The verdict of the jury was inconsistent with insanity, diminished responsibility or sane automatism. In the absence of evidence of causal connection the reference by the judge to the surrounding factors is sufficient to cover the depression called in aid of the Applicant. 
      
       
     33 No specific statement in, or section of, the Reasons for Sentence was pointed to as indicating error in relation to the depressive condition of the Applicant. In my opinion there is no such statement or section and no error has been demonstrated under this heading. 
      
       
     34 In my opinion this basis of the appeal fails. 
      
       
        
       As to (iv) 
        
       
     35 In support of this basis counsel for the Applicant referred to Regina v Kotevski (1998) NSWCCA unreported 3 April 1998 in which a sentence of 2 years 3 months with an additional term of 9 months had been imposed in respect of a charge of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm had not been interfered with. This case, it was submitted, indicated the extent of penalty that should have been imposed in the present case and indicated how excessive the sentence that had actually been imposed was. However, Regina v Kotevski (supra) was very different from the present case. First, it was for a different and lesser offence. Second, there had been a plea of guilty. Third, the decision in the appeal was that the sentence imposed was not shown to have been affected by error. That decision should not be seen as providing any indication of the period of the sentence that was appropriate in the present case. 
      
       
     36 Reference was also made to the decision in Regina v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310. That case involved a verdict of manslaughter given by a jury in a case in which the appellant had been tried for murder. An issue was whether an offer of a plea of guilty to manslaughter should be taken into account as the equivalent of a plea of guilty, even though not proffered before the jury. On appeal the court indicated that it could be taken as an indication of remorse and contrition. However, in the present case counsel for the Applicant sought to argue that the only reason that the Applicant did not plead guilty was that he did not remember what had happened and that, as a consequence, his plea of not guilty should in some way be accepted as indicative of remorse or as entitling him to some discount on the sentence. This was said to be because the complainant wife did not have to be cross-examined. However she was, and at some length.  
      
       
     37 The submission based on Regina v Oinonen (supra) is misconceived and fails.  
      
       
     38 Nothing advanced in respect of this basis discloses error on the part of the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     39 This ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
        
       GENERAL 
        
       
     40 Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court: 
         
        
        
         
         …  
         
        
        
         
         (c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction.” 
         
        
        
       However, this right is conditioned by s.6 of the Act. Section 6(3) provides that: 
        
        
         
         “On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence … should have been passed shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution thereof, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
         
        
       
     41 It is incumbent on the court therefore to form the opinion that some sentence other than that imposed would have been appropriate, before exercising the power conferred by s.5(1)(c). 
      
       
     42 An examination of the statistics based on 19 cases (one of which is the present case) in relation to offences under s.27 of the Crimes Act shows the following: 
      
       
        
       1. A custodial sentence was imposed in 100% of the cases. 
        
        
       2. A total of 86% of the full term of the sentences imposed fell between 8 and 14 years. 
        
        
       3. Only 16% of the sentences imposed were below 9 years. 
        
        
       4. In 48% of the cases the non-parole periods (or equivalent) fell between 5 and 7 years, with 5 years being the minimum non-parole period fixed. 
        
       
     43 The above statistics show that the sentence imposed by the trial judge fell towards the lower end of the scale notwithstanding the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence was committed. 
      
       
     44 In my opinion the sentence imposed cannot be said to be manifestly excessive either by reference to the statistics or by reference to the objective seriousness of the offence and its surrounding circumstances even when tempered by reference to the subjective elements particular to the applicant. Nor, in my opinion is the offence as detailed in the evidence such as to warrant a less severe penalty than that imposed by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     45 Even had there been some substance in the bases of appeal (ii) and (iii), that would not alter my view that, for this grave offence, no less severe penalty than that imposed was warranted in law. 
      
       
        
        
       SUMMARY 
        
       
     46 In my opinion, notwithstanding that basis of appeal (i) has been made out, the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive nor were the circumstances such as to warrant the imposition of a less severe penalty for the serious offence for which the applicant was convicted. 
      
       
     47 In the light of the error demonstrated by the applicant, the seriousness of the offence involved and the penalty imposed, I am of opinion that it would be appropriate to grant leave to appeal, but then to dismiss such appeal. 
      
       
        
       ORDERS 
        
       
     48 I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal granted. 
        
        
       2. Appeal dismissed. 
        
       
     49 Smart AJ: I agree.

       INTRODUCTION 
        
       
     1 Edward Morgan Cross (“the applicant”) has applied for an extension of the time within which to make an application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 19 April 2001.  
      
       
     2 Having pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of attempted robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and a charge of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, the applicant was committed for sentence. The applicant adhered to his pleas before the District Court and asked the sentencing judge to take into account an offence of break, enter and steal. The Judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of six years to commence on 20 July 2000 and expire on 19 July 2006. He set the non-parole period at two years and five months to expire on 19 December 2002. This sentence took into account the offence of break, enter and steal which had been included on the Form 1 Schedule. On the charge of taking and driving a conveyance without consent, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of nine months to commence on 20 July 2000 and expire on 19 April 2001.  
      
       
        
       The application presently before the Court was filed on 21 December 2001; that is some eight months after the date on which the sentence was imposed and some seven months after the date fixed for the making an application for leave to appeal had passed. 
        
        
       FACTS  
        
       
     3 At about 8.30am on 28 November 1999, the applicant went into a newsagency at Matraville armed with a syringe which was filled with a red fluid presumed to be blood. At the time, he was wearing a long blonde wig, a dark coloured beanie pulled down over his head and dark sunglasses. He had with him an empty white plastic shopping bag. The applicant approached a female who was standing behind the sales counter and told her to put money in the bag or he would stab her. Instead of doing so, the victim yelled out her husband’s name whereupon the applicant ran from the shop without any proceeds from his criminal endeavour. As it happened, the lady’s husband was not present on the premises at the relevant time. 
      
       
     4 Having left the newsagency, the applicant made his escape in a red 1983 Mazda 626 sedan, registered number RSR 648. This vehicle had been stolen from Maroubra some two weeks prior to the attempted robbery at the newsagency. At about 8.55am - that is, some 25 minutes after the attempted robbery - a police patrol car sighted the red Mazda 626 in a carpark which formed part of a shopping complex at Pagewood. The vehicle was stationary, with the driver’s door slightly open. The applicant was the sole occupant of the vehicle, and was occupying the driver’s seat. The applicant was arrested. At the time he was wearing a pair of dark sunglasses. A search of the vehicle revealed a blonde wig, a dark coloured beanie, a white plastic shopping bag, a syringe filled with a red substance and a grey wallet containing credit cards and other documents in the name of the applicant. 
      
       
     5 The investigating police interviewed the owner of the vehicle, who identified the blonde wig and the grey beanie worn by the applicant as belonging to him and made a statement that those items were in the boot of his car at the time he last saw it on 14 November 1999.  
      
       
     6 Prior to the offences the subject of the present appeal, the applicant had no convictions for any serious criminal matters. His only prior convictions were for driving offences, including a high range PCA. These offences were committed in 1995 and were dealt with by way of fine. 
      
       
        
       GROUNDS OF THE APPLICATION 
        
       
     7 In support of the application for an extension of the time within which to appeal, and for a grant of leave to appeal, counsel for the applicant relied on a number of errors into which, it is said, the Judge fell. These were that the he: 
      
       
        
       (i) Sentenced the applicant for an offence with which he had not been charged, and to which he had not pleaded guilty, namely armed robbery rather than an attempted armed robbery. 
        
        
       (ii) Misapplied the decision in  
       Regina v Henry  
       (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.  
        
        
       (iii) Enlarged the term of the sentence so as to allow for an extended period on parole for the purposes of supervision of the applicant. 
        
        
       (iv) Gave insufficient weight to the circumstances in which the appellant became addicted to drugs. 
        
        
       As to (i) above 
        
       
     8 At the sentence hearing, the Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that the applicant had pleaded guilty at Central Local Court on 12 January 2001 “to one count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon” and other offences (AB 12). A little later in the hearing, in the course of submissions concerning the effect on sentence of the matter to be taken into account, the following occurred:  
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel for the Applicant: … it’s a pretty standard break and enter.  
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: So what he was charged with … was robbery whilst armed, was it, with a dangerous weapon? 
         
        
        
         
         Counsel for the Applicant: Yes, it was, and then it was changed, amended to offensive weapon. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Robbery whilst armed with offensive weapon, that brings the maximum to 20 years. The other one is 25 years, I think, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         Counsel for the Appellant: Yes …” (AB 14) 
         
        
       
     9 The discussion between both counsel and the Judge reinforced an error in the charge cover sheet. It showed that the applicant had been charged with “robbery whilst armed with dangerous offensive weapon”. 
      
       
     10 In his Remarks on Sentence, His Honour stated at the outset that the applicant had pleaded guilty to two charges, the first being “robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years”. This was clearly an error. Furthermore, it was an error of a kind that was fundamental to the sentencing process involving the applicant. The error was the more serious since it was inter-related with the second ground relied upon by Counsel for the Applicant. . It is not an error of a kind that would fall within s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
      
       
        
       As to (ii) Above 
        
       
     11 In address, reference had been made to the guideline judgment in Regina v Henry (supra). It had been used to fix the datum for the sentence to be imposed. In the course of the submissions on sentence, 4 to 5 ½ years was referred to in this context, and in the course of the Remarks on Sentence, His Honour expressed the view that the syringe used by the applicant was “more serious than the use of a knife” and that there had been a “degree of planning” in the instant case which was greater than the limited degree of planning referred to in Regina v Henry (supra). However, as counsel for the applicant rightly pointed out, the guideline judgment was concerned with a completed offence rather than an attempt. It was thus a case which established a datum in respect of an offence for which the Judge was in fact sentencing the applicant, but it was an offence which he had neither committed nor pleaded guilty to.  
      
       
     12 There was thus error in two regards arising out of the use made of Regina v Henry (supra).  
      
       
        
       As to (iii) Above 
        
       
     13 In the sentencing process engaged in by the Judge he appears to have to determined the sentence to be imposed by reference to the date on which the applicant should become eligible for parole. This date was fixed as December 2002 - effectively a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months (AB 28). He then fixed the length of the sentence at 6 years, but appears to have done so by reference to the relationship of that period to the non-parole period already determined. In short, the way in which he approached the sentence was to increase its term so as to allow for an extended period on parole. This is an approach to sentencing which is not permitted, and constitutes an error (Regina v Carrion (2000) 49 NSWLR 149 at 152). 
      
       
        
       As to (iv) Above 
        
       
     14 The applicant was undoubtedly addicted to heroin at the time of the offences the subject of the appeal, and at the time of a later offence of steal from the person committed by him whilst on bail. In his Remarks on Sentence, the Judge referred to the circumstances which, it is said, led to the addiction of the applicant to heroin, namely the death by accidental drowning of his then girlfriend. His Honour accepted that there was “some truth” in the submission that such event had “shattered (the applicant’s) life” and that “having very little in the way of coping skills, he descended into the area where he now finds himself”.  
      
       
     15 This reference, allied with the Judge’s observation that the applicant seemed to be “a decent young man who, having been a person of good character, has gone off the rails…” demonstrates that the Judge did have regard to the circumstances in which the applicant became addicted to drugs.  
      
       
     16 In view of the fact that the errors identified above are an adequate basis for extending the time within which to appeal, granting leave to appeal and for this Court consider for itself the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the applicant, it is unnecessary to consider further this fourth ground on which the application is based. 
      
       
        
       SUMMARY 
        
       
     17 An examination of the Remarks on Sentence demonstrates error in the sentencing process of the kinds referred to in grounds (i), (ii), and (iii) above. They are, to an extent, inter-related. The first ground of itself constitutes a powerful ground on which to review the sentence imposed. When taken in conjunction with grounds (ii) and (iii), I am of opinion that the case for allowing the sentence to be reviewed, and in fact reviewing it, is a strong one. 
      
       
        
       RE-SENTENCING 
        
       
     18 I accept the finding of fact by his Honour that the life of the applicant was shattered by the tragic drowning of his girlfriend. Prior to that time, he had no record at all. He was a young man who was of good character, in stable employment, actively involved in sport and progressed along the course of acquiring a trade qualification as a plumber. A report from a consultant psychologist, Carmelita Simonato, identifies him as a person who had poor coping skills as a young man, and that this led to an association with another female who was a drug addict, and in turn to his own addiction and his acquiring hepatitis C.  
      
       
     19 At the time when he committed the offences the subject of the appeal, the evidence suggests that he was at his nadir. The offences were atypical. The fact that he ran away from the scene as a result of the shout from the female in the shop supports a conclusion that he was easily deterred from the course on which he had embarked, because it was essentially a course contrary to his character.  
      
       
     20 There was some planning involved in the criminal enterprise. The use of the wig, beanie and the syringe filled with red liquid, apparently blood, indicates this. However, his acquisition of the wig and of the beanie were an unforseen consequence of his stealing the car. Their acquisition does not betoken any long term or detailed planning of the attempted robbery. There is nothing to suggest that the wig and/or the beanie, or for that matter a syringe, had been used by him prior to 28 November 1999 for any unlawful purpose of the kind now before the Court. The wig and beanie had been in his possession for two weeks. His possession of the syringe in question, and the other syringes found in the car at the time he was arrested are more likely to be the consequence of his then drug addition than indicative of plans to carry out a robbery. 
      
       
     21 In prison, the applicant has proved to be a “trusted inmate”. According to the consultant psychologist, “he has rehabilitated himself virtually unaided”. The range of courses that he has undertaken for self-betterment is commendable. He has been working as a plumber at Parklea, and has expanded his skills by commencing a computer skills course which would assist in fitting him for employment as a plumber, or even perhaps in some supervisory or clerk of works position.  
      
       
     22 The Judge quoted verbatim, and appears to have adopted, part of the report from the consultant psychologist which states: 
      
       
        
         
          “It is my opinion that Mr Cross is essentially a person of good character whose judgment was clouded by issues associated with drug addiction and negative peer influences. His personal and employment history describe a basically stable young man. His hopes for the future are solid and conventional.” 
         
        
       
     23 The view adopted by the consultant psychologist is amply supported by the objective evidence in relation to the applicant’s background. Rehabilitation, therefore, is a major factor to take into account when re-sentencing the applicant, bearing in mind nonetheless the need for the protection of the community from such offences by, inter alia, having a proper regard to the general deterrence of sentences. 
      
       
     24 In Regina v Blackman [2001] NSWCCA 121, Wood CJ at CL adopted what had been said by King CJ in Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108: 
      
       
        
         
         “The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of, and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and  
         others who have not developed settled criminal habits 
         … If the sentence induces or assists an offender to avoid offending in future, the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm…” (supra at 112 – 113; emphasis added)  
         
        
       
     25 The stealing of the car and the events of 28 November 1999 should not be glossed over. Those offences, particularly the latter, are objectively serious and this Court ought not by its sentence to be thought or seen to be condoning them. A custodial sentence is necessary, but it should not be such as to crush the applicant, or to impede the process of rehabilitation upon which the applicant has embarked with a great deal of success to date. However, the sentence imposed in the District Court, in my opinion, was in excess of that which was appropriate for an attempted robbery as opposed to an actual robbery with an offensive weapon. Attempted crimes, in the main, attract sentences which are lower, and often significantly lower, than the sentences that would be imposed for a completed offence. The circumstances of each case must be considered. 
      
       
     26 Having regard to the age and personal circumstances of the applicant, his excellent attempts at and success in rehabilitation, the indications for his future, the pleas of guilty entered at an early time and the other matters adverted to above - but at the same time recognising the seriousness of the principle offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty - I am of opinion that a sentence of four years imprisonment would be appropriate.  
      
       
     27 The circumstances to which I have adverted above are sufficient to constitute special circumstances. I am satisfied that special circumstances exist and that accordingly it is appropriate to change the statutory ratio of non-parole period to sentence.  
      
       
     28 A period of supervision and encouragement would be appropriate for the applicant when he returns to the word outside prison. In my opinion, a period of two years of such supervision and encouragement would be appropriate. Accordingly, I am of opinion that the ratio of non-parole period to sentence should be adjusted from three quarters to one half, with a resulting non-parole period of two years from 20 July 2000 to 19 July 2002. The period between the date of this judgment and the date on which the applicant becomes eligible for release on parole will enable proper pre-release procedures to be carried out and give a period of time during which the applicant can look forward to a return to the community and to being a productive member of that community. 
      
       
        
       ORDERS 
        
       
     29 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       1. Extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal granted. 
        
        
       2. Leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on the applicant in respect of attempted armed robbery with an offensive weapon, otherwise application dismissed. 
        
        
       3. Appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of such offence allowed and sentence quashed. 
        
        
       4. In lieu of the sentence imposed in the District Court in respect of such charge, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for four years to commence on 20 July 2000 and to end on 19 July 2004.  
        
        
       5. Non-parole period fixed at 2 years to commence on 20 July 2000 and to end on 19 July 2002, on which date the applicant will become eligible for parole. 
        
       
     30 SMART AJ : I agree.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The appeal against conviction and sentence 
        
       
     2 This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appellant was represented by Mr Button in regard to the appeal against conviction but he argued his application for leave to appeal against sentence himself. Mr Button did not appear at the trial. Ms Cinque appeared on behalf of the Crown in the appeal. She, too, did not appear at the trial.  
      
       
     3 On 22 November 2000 the appellant was charged before Kinchington DCJ and a jury in respect of 40 counts of imposing upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation. Each of these charges alleged an offence contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
      
       
     4 The charges were said to arise in the following circumstances. The appellant was employed as an administrative services officer in the Retirement and Disability Unit of the Penrith office of Centrelink from 21 October 1996 to June 1999. The Crown alleged that over a period of some months, while the appellant was so employed, he used his computer “logon” identification fraudulently so as to cause electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) cards to be issued by the computer system in the Centrelink Penrith office. The cards were purportedly issued in favour of certain pensioners, who were unaware that this had been done.  
      
       
     5 The EBT cards purported to entitle the identified pensioners to credits of various amounts. The Crown alleged that the appellant used automatic telling machines (“ATM’s”) to withdraw cash representing the amount of each such credit. The total amount of money so withdrawn was $20,190. Each of the 40 counts related to the issue of a single EBT card and its subsequent encashment. 
      
       
     6 The appellant was acquitted in respect of counts 3, 4, 16 and 17. He was found guilty in respect of the remaining 36 counts. Kinchington DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment in the aggregate for three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years six months. His Honour made a reparation order of $20,190 in favour of the Commonwealth. 
      
       
     7 The appellant raised two grounds of appeal in respect of his appeal against conviction. The first ground was that the verdicts of guilty on the 36 counts were unreasonable and could not be supported, especially in the light of the evidence regarding the four counts on which he was acquitted. The second ground incorporated two arguments. The first argument was that the trial judge repeatedly intervened in the examination and cross-examination of witnesses to an extent that resulted in the trial being transformed from an adversarial contest presided over by an impartial judge into inquisitorial proceedings in which the judge played an extremely active role. The result, it was submitted, was that the trial was not a trial in accordance with our law. The second argument was that the judge’s interventions resulted in the appellant being denied a fair trial according to law and this led to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
        
        
        
       The first ground: was the verdict unsafe? 
        
       
     8 Effectively, the appellant did not dispute that each of the 40 EBT cards was fraudulently issued. The crucial question at the trial was, rather, whether the appellant was the person responsible for the issuing of the EBT cards and the collection of the money in respect of those cards from the ATM’s. 
      
       
     9 Generally, EBT cards were issued by Centrelink to persons entitled to instalments of Centrelink benefits or pensions in what were regarded as “emergencies”. Once an EBT card was issued to a particular person, that person could use the card at an ATM (in the same way as a credit card is so used) to withdraw a sum of money in accordance with instructions that had been electronically programmed into the EBT card by a computer operated in the Centrelink Penrith office. 
      
       
     10 A security system was in operation at the relevant time that was designed to ensure that EBT cards were issued only to appropriate persons. Part of the security system involved each person who operated a computer in the Penrith office having (and using) a logon identification and one or possibly two passwords. While the logon identification of each employee was generally known within the office, it was departmental policy that no employee should tell anyone else his or her current password. While the logon might generally be known within the office, the password was not.  
      
       
     11 At a later time, a system involving a “smart card” was introduced. This required use of such a card with a unique PIN number known only to the holder. The holder would use the smart card to gain access to the computer.  
      
       
     12 On each occasion that a person gained access to the computer (whether under the initial security system or under the later smart card system), a record was generated of such access. 
      
       
     13 The 40 offences charged fell into two categories. The first comprised instances where moneys were withdrawn from ATM’s during periods in the working day when the appellant’s logon identification and password were shown to be inactive. The second category comprised instances when moneys were withdrawn from ATM’s after the appellant’s working day had finished. 
      
       
     14 In regard to the first category the Crown attempted to establish that, in each case, the period of computer inactivity relating to the appellant’s logon identification and password was sufficiently long to enable the appellant to have walked to the ATM from which the money was withdrawn, effected a withdrawal, and then returned to the office. Similarly, in respect of the withdrawals after work hours, the Crown attempted to establish that, in each instance, there was sufficient time between the cessation of computer activity on the part of the appellant and the particular withdrawal from an ATM for the appellant to have effected each withdrawal. 
      
       
     15 The Crown led evidence at the trial to the following effect: 
      
       
        
       (a) Each of the EBT cards, the subject of the 40 counts, was issued under the logon identification and password of the appellant. 
        
        
       (b) The appellant did not tell anyone his password. 
        
        
       (c) Save in respect of count 16, the EBT cards were used to withdraw moneys from ATM’s at times when the logon identification and password of the appellant had not been used to activate a computer in the Penrith office. 
        
        
       (d) On the day each fraudulent EBT card was issued, access to the computer records of the pensioners in whose favour the EBT cards had been issued had been gained under the logon identification and password of the appellant; such access was for periods exceeding 10 minutes in each case in relation to all counts except counts 8, 13, 15, 21, 26, 33 and 36. 
        
        
       (e) In relation to counts 6, 7, 20, 33 and 39 (which involved withdrawals from ATM’s after work hours) the ATM’s from which the funds were withdrawn were located on the route travelled by the appellant between the Penrith office and his home. 
        
        
       (f) According to the attendance records and staff roster of the Penrith office, apart from one Andrew Croucher the appellant was the only staff member of the Retirement and Disability Unit who was present at work on each day a fraudulent EBT card was issued and EBT funds were fraudulently withdrawn from an ATM. Croucher said that at the relevant time he was not familiar with the steps required to issue an EBT card. 
        
        
       (g) In respect of counts 8, 21 and 26, the relevant EBT card was issued between 7.00 am and 7.30 am on days when according to the “flex sheets” the appellant was the only person on duty at the time of the issue. 
        
        
       (h) Each staff member employed at the Penrith office during the relevant time denied using the appellant’s logon identification and password to gain access to the Centrelink computer system. 
        
        
       (i) Each staff member employed at the Penrith office during the relevant time, except one Barbara Bezzina, denied issuing any EBT card under the appellant’s logon identification and password; Barbara Bezzina said she doubted having done so, and had she done so it would have been done while she was training the appellant. 
        
        
       (j) None of the employees in the Penrith office used a computer that was logged on at a particular work site without the permission and the presence of the person whose logon identification and password had been used to activate the computer; there was one exception to this rule, namely, the computer at the reception area where it was not uncommon for the person who first logged on to that computer to leave it (activated by his or her logon identification and password) for use by others. 
        
        
       (k) In respect of all counts except counts 16 and 17, there was sufficient time between the commencement of computer inactivity relating to the logon identification and password of the appellant and the ATM withdrawals to have enabled the appellant to walk from the Penrith office to the relevant ATM and to make the withdrawal. The Crown contended, in respect of counts 16 and 17, that the appellant had left the reception computer logged on under his logon identification and password to enable that computer to be used by others while he made the ATM withdrawals. 
        
        
        (l) In the case of all counts involving withdrawals from ATM’s during working hours (except counts 3 and 4), the period from the time of the ATM withdrawal to the commencement of computer activity based on the appellant’s logon identification and password was sufficient to have enabled the appellant to return from the relevant ATM to the Penrith office. In the case of counts 3 and 4, the Crown contended that the appellant had left the reception computer logged on under his logon identification and password to enable that computer to be used by others while he made the ATM withdrawals. 
        
        
       (m) According to the flex attendance sheets, the appellant was on duty at the times that all but two of the 40 EBT cards were issued. In regard to the two in question (namely, those in respect of counts 14 and 18) the flex sheet times recorded by the appellant were consistent with him not taking the breaks recorded but doing so at a time after the EBT cards in question were issued. 
        
        
       (n) According to the flex attendance sheets, each of the other members of the Retirement and Disability Unit was off duty on a substantial number of occasions when the 40 EBT cards were issued. 
        
        
       (o) The issuing of the EBT cards, the subject of counts 10, 24, 30 and 40, was approved by a second officer in circumstances where it was likely that the second officer would have known under which logon identification the computer had been activated and would have noticed if the person requesting the approval for the issuing of the cards was not the appellant. 
        
       
     16 As regards counts 3 and 4, the periods between the withdrawal of cash and the resumption of computer activity under the appellant’s logon identification and password were too short for him to have been able to return to the office after withdrawing the money from the ATM’s in time to resume the recorded computer activity in the Penrith office. 
      
       
     17 As regards counts 16 and 17, the periods of inactivity of the appellant’s logon identification and password were too brief for him to have left the Centrelink premises and walked to the ATM’s concerned to withdraw the money. 
      
       
     18 Accordingly, there was a significant difference between counts 3, 4, 16 and 17, on which the appellant was acquitted, and those counts in respect of which he was found guilty. That is to say, the difficulties in regard to time that the Crown faced in regard to counts 3, 4, 16 and 17 did not exist in regard to the other counts. Therefore, it could not reasonably be argued that the verdicts in respects of counts 3, 4, 16 and 17 were inconsistent with the guilty verdicts within the meaning of the authorities. Mr Button, counsel for the appellant, quite properly did not submit that there was such an inconsistency. Rather, he submitted that when considering all of the evidence, and paying proper regard to the four acquittals, the 36 verdicts of guilty were unreasonable. This submission, in essence, went to the weight of the circumstantial evidence against the appellant. 
      
       
     19 As mentioned, the Crown case in respect of counts 3, 4, 16 and 17 was that the appellant had activated the computer at the office reception desk with his logon identification and password, and had left the computer so operating while he walked to the ATM’s to withdraw moneys. Mr Button pointed to the fact that the appellant’s defence to the mass of circumstantial evidence against him was that someone else had used a computer that had been activated with the appellant’s logon identification to carry out the fraudulent operations. Thus, it was said, the Crown case in respect of counts 3, 4, 16 and 17 accepted the reality of the possibility on which the appellant’s defence was based. This was the strongest argument raised by Mr Button in regard to this ground.  
      
       
     20 Mr Button also pointed to the fact that the appellant had raised character as a defence and had gone into evidence to deny the charges against him. 
      
       
     21 Mr Button accepted, however, that, in regard to the 36 counts, there was no gap or missing link in the Crown case.  
      
       
     22 I am not persuaded by the argument advanced on the appellant’s behalf. The Crown case against the appellant was powerful. The accumulation of all the matters on which the Crown relied (which I have set out above) made out a very strong case. There was ample evidence on which a jury could find, reasonably, that the appellant was guilty of the 36 charges. The point made by Mr Button concerning the reception desk computer is no answer to the strength of the Crown case in regard to the 36 charges. 
      
       
     23 Once it is accepted that there was no missing link in the chain of evidence implicating the appellant, and that the verdicts of acquittal were not inconsistent with the verdicts of guilty, then it cannot be said that it was not open to the jury, on the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. I would dismiss the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       The adversarial character of the trial 
        
       
     24 Mr Button put the argument grounded on what was submitted to be the inquisitorial character of the trial on the basis that, irrespective of whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or material unfairness in the proceedings, the appeal should succeed.  
      
       
     25 An incident occurred during the trial that Mr Button submitted revealed his Honour’s state of mind and general attitude to his role. In the course of the testimony of a Crown witness, Ms McMahon, his Honour held a voir dire in the absence of the jury. Neither counsel had asked him to do this. Indeed, Mr Brazier, counsel for the appellant at the trial, objected.  
      
       
     26 In response to the objection, the judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I want to clarify this issue”. 
         
        
        
       He then proceeded to ask Ms McMahon a series of questions concerning the practices in the Centrelink office relating to the use of computers. The judge eventually explained: 
        
        
         
         “I initiated this voir dire because of evidence that the witness seemed to be about to bring out and I wanted to ascertain the relevance of it and that it didn’t raise prejudicial matters to [the appellant].” 
         
        
       
     27 I must say that the procedure so adopted by his Honour was quite extraordinary. He acted of his volition in holding the voir dire and did so over the objection of counsel for the appellant. The transcript of the voir dire extended over about three pages. Apart from one question from the prosecutor, to which there was an objection and to which the witness did not reply, during the voir dire the judge undertook all the questioning of the witness. 
      
       
        
       His Honour’s explanation for holding the voir dire is difficult to understand. A decision as to the relevance or otherwise of evidence is usually determined during the course of the trial upon objection by a party to the evidence. Relevance is not usually determined by means of a voir dire called at the judge’s own motion where only the judge questions the witness. Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case, it is not clear to me how the holding of the voir dire would have assisted the judge in preventing matters prejudicial to the appellant being brought out later in evidence. 
        
       
     28 Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the holding of the voir dire caused the appellant any prejudice. It took place in the absence of the jury and nothing that was said in the voir dire had any bearing on the case or any influence over it. It does, however, support the argument that, at times during the case, his Honour had an unusual attitude to his judicial duties. 
      
       
     29 His Honour intervened many times in the running of the trial by asking questions of the witnesses. He questioned Crown witnesses as well as the appellant and not only in cross-examination but in chief. Many of the interventions involved the asking of a small number of questions. Others, however, involved extended questioning where the interchange between his Honour and the witness concerned occupied two to three pages of the transcript.  
      
       
     30 In his written submissions Mr Button stated that the trial transcript showed that Kinchington DCJ asked 358 questions of the appellant “of which 261 went beyond clarification and other non-objectionable matters”. Without verifying the arithmetic, there can be no doubt that his Honour asked a vast number of questions while the appellant was being cross-examined. Some of these questions brought out weaknesses in the defence case. Some were indicative of a disbelief on the part of his Honour of evidence that had been given by the appellant.  
      
       
     31 The appellant’s evidence itself occupied some 220 pages of the transcript. The number of questions asked of the appellant by his Honour must be seen against this background. Ms Cinque, who appeared on behalf of the Crown in this appeal, pointed out that the trial lasted 19 sitting days and Mr Brazier had described the proceedings as a “difficult and complex trial”. As Ms Cinque observed, “there was a vast amount of evidence both testimonial and documentary involving the operation of the Centrelink computer system”. At times, the evidence given on technical issues was not easy to understand, and the points that counsel were attempting to elicit were difficult to bring out. Much of the judge’s questioning was prompted by this.  
      
       
     32 When the questions Kinchington DCJ asked are examined without reference to the context of the trial as a whole, it could be said that he asked an unusually large number (relative to the amount of questions a judge might customarily ask). But when regard is had to the trial as a whole, and measuring the number of questions his Honour asked against those asked by counsel, that number is relatively very small. 
      
       
        
       The judge’s interventions, did result in him, for differing periods, occasionally taking over the questioning of witnesses. Nevertheless they do not, by any stretch of the imagination, give rise to an impression that he assumed the overall conduct of the trial, as would be the case in an inquisitorial process.  
        
       
     33 Despite the number and character of the interventions, the form of the trial was plainly in accordance with Australian law and tradition. The holding of the voir dire at Kinchington DCJ’s own motion, during which he alone questioned the witness, was a departure from accepted practice. Nevertheless, the voir dire was short in duration and, as I have explained, made no difference to the course of the proceedings or the result. I do not accept that his Honour’s other interventions altered the essential character of the trial. I repeat that in comparison with the number of questions asked during the trial, overall, his Honour’s questions were not significant in quantity. I accept that the judge often intervened in the questioning of witnesses, and sometimes did so for unusually lengthy periods. Nevertheless, he left to counsel the general task of undertaking the examination in chief and the cross-examination of the witnesses. His Honour called no witnesses and did not direct the course of the proceedings. The essential nature of the trial was adversarial. I would reject the argument that the trial was an inquisitorial process. 
      
       
        
        
       The fairness of the trial: the legal principles 
        
       
     34 The conclusion to which I have come in regard to the adversarial character of the trial has, of course, no bearing on the merits of the argument that the interventions resulted in the appellant not having a fair trial. I turn now to that question. 
      
       
     35 The relevant principles were enunciated by Kirby ACJ in Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 281 to 282. In summary his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The test to be applied is whether the excessive judicial questioning … [has] created a real danger that the trial was unfair. If so, the judgment must be set aside … 
         
        
        
         
         2. [G]reater latitude in questioning and comment will be accepted where a judge is sitting alone … 
         
        
        
         
         3. … the appellate court must consider whether … the judge has … moved into counsel’s shoes and ‘into the perils of self-persuasion’ …  
         
        
        
         
         4. The decision on whether the point of unfairness has been reached must be made in the context of the whole trial and in the light of the number, length, terms and circumstances of the interventions … 
         
        
        
         
         5. It is also relevant to consider the point at which the judicial interventions complained of occur. … 
         
        
        
         
         6. The general rules for conduct of a trial and the general expression of the respective functions of judge and advocate do not change … The conduct of criminal trials, particularly with a jury, remains subject to different and more stringent requirements …” 
         
        
       
     36 There are other statements of principle in the authorities that are relevant to the circumstances of this case. The following are particularly pertinent:  
      
       
        
       (a) A miscarriage of justice may “involve an impairment of a party’s opportunity of putting his defence fully and fairly to the jury” ( 
       R v Mawson 
        [1967] VR 205 at 207 to 208). 
        
        
       (b) A miscarriage may “result from the jury being led to believe from the judge’s intervention that he is himself convinced of the guilt of the accused person” ( 
       R v Mawson 
        at 207 to 208). Trial judges should not create the impression by the way in which they question the accused that they have thrown their weight on the side of the prosecution:  
       Mercer  
       (1993) 67 A Crim R 91. 
        
        
       (c) It is for counsel to examine the witnesses “and not for the judge to take it on himself lest by so doing he appear to favour one side or the other” (per Denning LJ in  
       Jones v National Coal Board 
        [1957] 2 QB 55 at 63 to 65). 
        
        
       (d) A departure from the due and orderly processes of a fair trial may amount to a miscarriage of justice or may infringe the principle that criminal justice must not only be done but must also appear to be done:  
       R v Mawson 
        (at 207 to 208). 
        
       
     37 In R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 Wood CJ at CL conducted a careful examination of relevant authorities dealing with judicial intervention in criminal trials and concluded (at 472): 
      
       
        
         
         “The line that a trial judge walks when asking questions of a witness is a narrow one. There is nothing wrong with questions designed to clear up answers that may be equivocal or uncertain, or, within reason, to identify matters that may be of concern to himself. However, once the judge resorts to extensive questioning, particularly of the kind that amounts to cross-examination in a criminal trial before a jury, then he is treading on thin ice. The thinness of the ice will depend upon the identity of the witness being examined (here the person on trial), and on whether the questions appear to be directed towards elucidating an area of evidence that has been overlooked or left in an uncertain or equivocal state, or directed towards establishing a point that is favourable or adverse to the interests of one or other of the parties. 
         
        
        
         
         As Hunt CJ at CL said in  
         R v E 
          (1995) 89 A Crim R 325 at 331:… ‘it is worth repeating what has been said by this Court on many other occasions. The task of restoring the credit of a Crown witness or of destroying the credit of the accused or witness should  
         always 
          be  
         left by the 
           
         judge to the Crown Prosecutor’” 
         . 
         
        
        
       
     38 Notwithstanding the many judicial comments that have been made in regard to the issue, the boundary between permissible judicial intervention in a criminal trial and intervention of a kind that results in an unfair trial is not capable of clear definition. While the line may be narrow and the ice may be thin, the line is not bright and it is not always easy to determine whether the ice will hold. There are, indeed, circumstances in which a trial judge may legitimately intervene in a criminal trial. 
      
       
     39 In a proper case, intervention may be warranted for the purpose of preventing undue delay or to ensure that the parties focus on the crucial issues in the case, and a judge who does not so intervene may be criticised by an appellate court: see R v Wilson and Grimwade [1995] 1 VR 163. Whether the degree of intervention is appropriate is a matter of balance and judgment. In this case, however, the vast majority of the interventions by Kinchington DCJ were not designed to curtail the proceedings and they were not made for the purposes of managing the conduct of the trial. 
      
       
     40 It has long been accepted that a judge may intervene for the purpose of clarifying the evidence (see, for example, Yuill v Yuill [1945] 1 All ER 183). That is to say, clarifying it not only so that the judge understands it but so that the jury understands it as well.  
      
       
     41 In the course of clarifying the evidence, the judge may, involuntarily, but inevitably, assist either the prosecution or the defence. But I do not accept that that makes such an intervention improper. It is not the law that a judge must allow the evidence to be left in a state of incomprehensibility. We have long since departed from the “game” or “sporting” theory of justice; see the remarks of Hope JA in Bassett v Host [1982] 1 NSWLR 206 at 207 and Mahoney JA in GIO of NSW v Glasscock (1991) 13 MVR 521 at 530.  
      
       
     42 That having been said, it must be emphasised that intervention for the purpose of clarification does not necessarily require the judge to question the witness. The judge may readily achieve clarification by pointing out, at an appropriate time, usually in the absence of the jury, evidential ambiguities or obscurities to counsel. That is by far the most desirable course. It should be left to counsel, whenever possible, to deal with such matters. If the judge undertakes the task by questioning witnesses, there is the danger that he or she will assume, albeit temporarily, the role of counsel and become identified with the cause of one side or another. Unfairness can readily be the consequence. 
      
       
     43 If a judge does question a witness, and goes beyond mere clarification, the trial is not automatically unfair. In R v Hopper [1915] 2 KB 431 Reading LCJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court of Criminal Appeal, said (at 435): 
      
       
        
         
         “Whatever the line of defence adopted by counsel at the trial of a prisoner, we are of opinion that it is for the judge to put such questions as appear to him properly to arise upon the evidence even although counsel may not have raised some question himself”. 
         
        
        
       In  
       Cain 
        (1936) 25 Cr App R 204 Du Parcq J (in delivering the judgment of the English Court of Criminal Appeal) remarked: 
        
        
         
         “There is no reason why the judge should not from time to time interpose such questions as seem to him fair and proper”. 
         
        
        
       See also  
       Gilson and Cohen 
        (1944) 29 Cr App R 174 at 181.  
        
       
     44 Whether the judge’s questioning leads to a decision that the trial was unfair is a matter of balance, degree and judgment. 
      
       
        
       Was the trial unfair in this case? 
        
       
     45 The argument of the appellant was that the judge entered into the trial arena, disturbed the appellant’s counsel in the orderly presentation of his case, and assisted counsel for the prosecution by clearing up ambiguities in the Crown case and emphasising the points tending to establish the guilt of the appellant. Further, it was said, from time to time the judge made it clear to the jury that he did not believe the appellant and identified himself with the Crown case. 
      
       
     46 It appears from the transcript of the evidence that the questioning of the witnesses by his Honour fell into the following categories: 
      
       
        
       (a) Questions asked for the purposes of clarifying evidence the judge did not understand or thought that the jury would not understand.  
        
        
       (b) Questions asked for the purposes of clarification but which showed inconsistencies or other difficulties in the evidence given by the witness. In asking these questions, his Honour was trying, it seems, to get to the bottom of complex factual matters that had not been articulated with clarity.  
        
        
       (c) Questions asked after counsel for the appellant had objected, sometimes successfully, to the form of a question asked by counsel for the Crown. Generally, the judge when so questioning a witness, followed the line suggested by the objectionable question and pursued the inquiry for several questions. 
        
        
       (d) Questions that assisted the prosecution in bringing out its case more clearly. Usually, these questions did not go to issues that were the subject of serious credibility disputes. Generally, they were asked when the evidence given was vague or did not point up the relevant facts with lucidity. It could be said that these questions, too, were asked for the purposes of clarification.  
        
        
       (e) Questions that were asked of Crown witnesses that had the effect of bringing out, in summary form, the salient points of the witness’s testimony. The effect of this questioning was to clarify and make more effective the Crown case. 
        
        
       (f) Questions that were plainly in the nature of cross-examination. These questions were asked largely of the appellant, when he testified. 
        
       
     47 I appreciate that the foregoing comments are of a general nature. I do not propose to refer to each and every question asked by the judge. There would be little point in doing so as, over this lengthy trial, there were very many such questions, and extracting a small number would be likely to give a misleading impression. In R v Lewis (2001) NSWCCA 345 Sully J (with whom Priestley JA agreed), when dealing with a similar argument to that raised on behalf of the appellant in the present case, stated that he thought it “both preferable and sufficient” to deal with the matter by observing that he had read the entirety of the trial transcript and decided the issue on the basis of the impression that he had gained at the end of that exercise. It seems to me that in a case such as this, where a considerable body of evidence was led, where so many questions were asked by the judge, and where many were legitimate and more than a few were not, it is simply impracticable, in these reasons, to embark upon an analysis of each question.  
      
       
     48 I shall, however, deal with particular questions by Kinchington DCJ that Mr Button, in his supplementary written submissions, highlighted in bold print. I assume that, by so highlighting these particular questions, Mr Button was impliedly submitting that they were particularly egregious transgressions by the judge.  
      
       
     49 At Appeal Book 1010 Kinchington DCJ asked a question of the appellant which Mr Button described as being “designed to destroy the defence theory”. The question was “After you’d concluded the packing exercise would you speak to the logon ID that left the note? What was your practice to do?”  
      
       
        
       I do not accept the criticism made of this question. The question was not a leading one. It was in open form and was intended to ascertain the appellant’s practice on a particular aspect of computer use. The judge would not have known what the appellant’s answer would be. I do not think that the question was of an inherently harmful nature. It could readily fall into the category of clarification.  
        
       
     50 At Appeal Book 1057 the judge asked the appellant whether he had ever given anyone his password. The appellant replied in the negative. Mr Button submitted that this question was “very damaging”. 
      
       
        
       The appellant had previously testified in the course of his evidence in chief that he had not given his password to any other person. Therefore, the question could not be regarded as damaging to him on the ground that it sought to elicit information that was new. I accept, however, that, at the stage that it was asked, it tended to detract (to a limited degree) from the cogency of the defence. I do not accept, however, that it was “very damaging”. 
        
       
     51 At Appeal Book 1100, line 40, Kinchington DCJ asked the appellant whether he could recollect whether, on a particular day when his logon identification was used for a fraudulent transaction, he was away from his terminal. Mr Button submitted that this was a “telling” question.  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s answer was that he could not recollect whether he was away from the terminal or not. I do not accept that the question was “telling”. 
        
       
     52 At Appeal Book 1124, line 25, the judge asked the appellant whether he had a similar problem to those employees who could not commence work at 7.00 am because they had to take their children to school. Mr Button described this question as “forensically devastating”. 
      
       
        
       The question assumed that the appellant did not have to take children to school and, accordingly, could get to work at 7.00 am each morning so as to be in a position, potentially, to effect the fraudulent transactions. While this question did not assist the appellant, it is an overstatement to describe it as “forensically devastating”. 
        
       
     53 At Appeal Book 1144 the following exchange took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. That EBT card was approved at 7.15.37 seconds, but at this time you are unable to say who was in the office at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It would be impossible to tell.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your records indicate I think that you signed on at seven o’clock that day. 
         
        
        
         
         A. That would probably correct, yes.” 
         
        
        
       Mr Button submitted that, with these two questions, “The trial judge elegantly damages very badly indeed the appellant’s evidence and the defence case as a whole”.  
        
        
       These questions, however, merely elicited evidence that had already been given. It is true that by asking them the judge emphasised material that indicated that the appellant could well have been the perpetrator of the relevant fraudulent transaction. Once more, however, it is an overstatement to say that these questions damaged “very badly indeed” the defence case. The evidence previously given had already damaged the case.  
        
       
     54 At Appeal Book 850 the judge asked a series of questions commencing with the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Would you pack on something not knowing who you were packing on or checking”. 
         
        
        
       Mr Brazier objected and submitted that this was a “further cross-examination of the witness”. His Honour ignored the objection and proceeded.  
        
        
       The questions so asked were undoubtedly not designed to clarify material. They were questions that could properly be categorised as cross-examination. In my view they were unfair and by asking them the judge transgressed the bounds of his obligation to conduct the trial in a neutral and impartial manner.  
        
       
     55 Having dealt with the individual questions to which Mr Button gave particular emphasis, I return to my general impressions of the questioning conducted by Kinchington DCJ and the overall effect of his interventions. 
      
       
     56 Some of the difficulties that Kinchington DCJ sought to clarify were of a kind where obscurities could be (and were) resolved by a one or two brief questions. I do not think that those questions were improper. There were instances, however, where the obscurities were more substantial, and where several questions were needed to clarify them. I think those questions should not have been asked by the judge. The difficulties he had should have been resolved by his Honour directing the attention of counsel to them in the way I have earlier suggested.  
      
       
     57 In some instances, the judge disturbed the flow of the defence cross-examination and hampered Mr Brazier in his cross-examination. I do not think, however, that – at any stage - the prejudice was of any real significance.  
      
       
     58 In some instances the jury could have gained the impression from the manner of questioning and the content of the questions that Kinchington DCJ was sceptical about certain aspects of the defence case. Such an attitude on the part of the trial judge is not unknown in our system and the mere fact of its existence does not give rise to an unfair trial. As with all the pertinent factors in this case, issues of degree arise. It was undesirable and inappropriate for the judge to allow his views to become apparent. But I am not persuaded that the extent to which this occurred gave rise to an unfair trial.  
      
       
     59 His Honour at times became impatient with counsel (both for the prosecution and the defence), and in some instances where questions were not properly asked, but where the thrust of the questions was apparent, he simply took over the questioning, apparently in a desire to shorten the proceedings. There is little to commend this practice, and occasionally his Honour’s questioning worked to the prejudice of the appellant. In the particular circumstances of the case, however, I do not think that that prejudice resulted in significant unfairness. 
      
       
     60 The practice of the judge in, at times, bringing out the salient points of the evidence of Crown witnesses, either during the course of examination in chief or after re-examination, was highly undesirable. I accept that to an extent the appellant was prejudiced thereby, but in the particular circumstances the extent of the prejudice was not so significant as to render the trial unfair. 
      
       
     61 Mr Brazier objected several times to questions asked by Kinchington DCJ. He asked the judge to stop “cross-examining” on more than one occasion. His Honour considered the term “cross-examining” to be offensive and asked that it be withdrawn. At one point Kinchington DCJ explained that he had asked certain questions to clarify the evidence as he did not understand it. Despite the several objections by counsel for the appellant, the judge persisted. Indeed, it appears, at times, that an objection by counsel would incite his Honour to further bouts of extended questioning. This was plainly inappropriate. Mr Brazier, however, did not apply for the termination of the trial and the discharge of the jury on the grounds of the judge’s conduct. 
      
       
     62 In my view, several of Mr Brazier’s objections to his Honour’s questioning were without substance. There can be no doubt, however, that on some occasions, as I have noted, the judge’s questioning went beyond clarification of the evidence and some of his Honour’s interventions should not have been made. But I have concluded that these transgressions, on balance, did not result in significant prejudice sufficient to result in an unfair trial. 
      
       
     63 On reading the transcript I have had real misgivings about some of the judge’s questions. Nevertheless, taking into account all the matters to which I have referred, individually and collectively, I am not persuaded that there has been a miscarriage of justice. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
        
       Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     64 Kinchington DCJ sentenced the appellant to a term of three years and nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months. His Honour made a reparation order in favour of the Commonwealth of $20,190.  
      
       
     65 The maximum penalty provided under s 29B of the Crimes Act for the offences of which the appellant was convicted was two years imprisonment and/or a fine of $13,800. 
      
       
     66 At the sentencing hearing, the Crown submitted that his Honour was entitled to impose a single sentence based upon the total of the penalties available for all the 36 offences of which the appellant was convicted. His Honour accepted this submission and proceeded to so sentence the appellant. 
      
       
     67 The Crown now accepts that the submissions so made to his Honour were wrong and were contrary to R v Edward Spencer Pearce (2001) NSWCCA 447 in which this Court (citing R v Bibaoui (1996) 87 A Crim R 527 and R v Jackson (1998) 104 A Crim R 196) held that the imposition of a single sentence for a number of offences was impermissible where the Crown has proceeded by way of indictment.  
      
       
     68 In the circumstances this Court is required to re-sentence the appellant. In so doing the Court is required to pay due weight to the overall sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ. 
      
       
     69 The applicant, who as I have mentioned represented himself in the application for leave to appeal against sentence, filed two sets of written submissions. I shall deal with the matters raised in those submissions. 
      
       
     70 The appellant pointed out that his wife suffered from medical problems that were relatively serious. She is an insulin dependent diabetic. She was described by a treating doctor as being “in a very disabled state”. She experienced insomnia and “self-recriminatory thoughts”. The appellant asserted that his wife required “a lot of care and attention” and this was borne out by medical reports. 
      
       
     71 Kinchinton DCJ referred expressly to the health of the appellant’s wife and observed that “she is not in the best of health and is undoubtedly very dependent upon the offender”. His Honour expressly noted that “a custodial sentence would undoubtedly impact on his wife”. 
      
       
     72 Despite taking into account the matters to which the appellant has referred, the judge considered that the offences were so serious that they required the imposition of a custodial sentence. I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in this respect. 
      
       
     73 The appellant submitted that Kinchington DCJ gave insufficient weight to his pre-existing medical condition. In particular, the appellant submitted that the judge had not accorded adequate weight to the conclusions of Dr Canaris which were to the following effect: 
      
       
        
         
         “I would respectfully suggest to the Court that there are strong psychiatric, social and for that matter physical grounds in my opinion to consider non-custodial options as far as possible. Any of these factors taken in isolation would not suffice to draw me to that conclusion. All of them taken together, however, cause me very considerable concern”. 
         
        
       
     74 The appellant referred to other medical conditions from which he suffered. These include renal problems and encephalopathy. Further, on 19 February 2001 he fractured his fibula. These matters were referred to in a report by Dr Lim and the appellant complained that his Honour made no specific mention of the contents of Dr Lim’s report. 
      
       
     75 Kinchington DCJ however did make express reference to the medical reports of Dr Canaris and Dr Lim. He referred to Dr Canaris’ opinion that the appellant “by any standard is a very sick man” and that the appellant had “a substantially shortened lifespan”. His Honour recognised that the appellant would find custody a difficult and onerous experience. He stated that he took into account the fact that the appellant’s “psychological and medical health and age may increase the hardships that he will undergo while in custody”. 
      
       
     76 In the circumstances Kinchington DCJ made no error in failing to have regard to the appellant’s medical condition.  
      
       
     77 His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]his was a well conceived and blatant episode of fraudulent conduct committed by the offender on the Commonwealth over the period in question in respect of which conduct the offender has shown no contrition and because in my opinion there are no special circumstances apart from his health which I have taken into consideration which would allow me to approach this sentencing process in any other way.”  
         
        
       
     78 I am not persuaded that the approach of the judge was wrong. It was open to his Honour to conclude that the offences committed were so serious as to require a custodial sentence of the order of that imposed. 
      
       
     79 The appellant made other submissions relating to the sentence that, in a sense, were directed more at the merits of the jury’s verdict than the sentence itself. These submissions challenged his Honour’s finding that the facts disclosed a course of criminal conduct which continued over a period of approximately four and a half months, a course of conduct carried out in a calculated manner that would have required planning. In my view these findings were open to the judge and I am not persuaded that they were wrong. 
      
       
     80 The appellant submitted that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In my opinion there is no substance in this submission. As Kinchington DCJ observed, the criminal conduct involved a considerable degree of planning over a period of four and a half months. Serious breaches of trust took place. In my view, the sentence imposed was within a proper sentencing discretion.  
      
       
     81 In view of the error in sentencing conceded by the Crown, I would uphold the application for leave to appeal against sentence and uphold the appeal. I would set aside the sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ. I would impose the following sentences in lieu of that sentence. 
      
       
     82 I would sentence the appellant to nine months imprisonment on each of the 36 counts in respect of which he was found guilty. The sentences in respect of counts 40, 5, 34, 37 and 22 should be cumulative upon each other. The sentences in respect of counts 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38 and 39 should be concurrent with the sentence imposed in respect of count 22. 
      
       
     83 The sentence imposed in respect of count 40 should date from 23 March 2001, the date fixed by Kinchington DCJ for the sentence imposed by him. The sentence imposed in respect of count 5 should date from 23 December 2001, that in respect of count 34 from 23 September 2002, that in respect of count 37 from 23 June 2003, and that in respect of count 22 from 23 March 2004.  
      
       
     84 The aggregate of the head sentences referred to in the previous paragraph would therefore be three years and nine months. I propose that, pursuant to s 19AB(1)(d) of the Crimes Act, a non-parole period of two years and six months be fixed. Accordingly, the effect of the sentences would be the same as the overall sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ. That is to say, the appellant would serve an overall term of imprisonment of three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years and six months and he would be eligible to be released on parole on or after 22 September 2003. As Kinchington DCJ observed, whether the appellant will be so released will depend upon the Parole Board which no doubt will take into consideration his behaviour while in custody and any efforts he has made or makes towards his own rehabilitation while in custody.  
      
       
     85 The reparation order made by Kinchington DCJ should remain unchanged. 
      
       
     86 SULLY J: I agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     87 BELL J: I agree with Ipp AJA.

      REGINA v. KAREN DIANA POPE 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Karen Diana Pope has pleaded guilty before me to one count of infanticide, that being an offence under s.22A of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable, as for manslaughter, by a maximum of 25 years' imprisonment. That plea has been accepted by the Crown in full discharge of an indictment, which also included a count of murder, to which count Mrs. Pope had pleaded not guilty.  
     
      
    2 The Crown has accepted the plea on the basis that at the time of the acts or omissions causing death, she was suffering from a post-natal condition caused by the birth of the child which, in the context of her pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, affected the balance of her mind to the extent that in wilfully causing the death of the child she was not guilty of murder but guilty of the crime of infanticide. I shall deal with the matter on that basis. 
     
      
    3 The consequence of those pleas is that I am, therefore, to sentence her for the crime of infanticide. That crime was committed on her child, Rachael Victoria Audrey Pope, who was, at the time, aged 12 weeks, in circumstances that, because of the mental condition of Mrs. Pope, have not been able, despite conscientious investigation, to be precisely detailed, but where Mrs. Pope drowned her daughter in the baby's bath.  
     
      
    4 At the time of the acts or omissions causing the death, it is common ground that Mrs. Pope, who had had a lengthy history of psychiatric illness and had been the subject of recent admissions to hospital and very recent medical observation and treatment, was suffering from such a condition of mind as to verge upon not being mentally responsible in law for her actions at all. 
     
      
    5 Later in these remarks on sentence I will refer to the psychiatric opinion concerning her condition at the time in more detail.  
     
      
    6 Following the discovery of the infant's body, Mrs. Pope spent a very lengthy period of time in psychiatric institutions, in full-time care. During that period she was treated for her psychiatric condition, not only with psychotropic medication, but during bouts of catatonia, with electroconvulsive therapy; she was so treated on some 21 occasions. That treatment and the whole of the psychiatric treatment afforded to her, restored her to such a degree of health that on 25 September 2001, by arrangement with her solicitor, she attended the Castle Hill Police Station to be charged with the homicide of her daughter.  
     
      
    7 The background to the events includes reference to the child Rachael having been the child of Mrs. Pope and her present husband, she having had a child by a previous relationship who is somewhat older. The birth of that earlier child had been attended by a consequential post-natal depression on Mrs. Pope's part. She had a lengthy history of psychiatric problems. She had been diagnosed, on occasion, as suffering from severe anxiety neurosis, schizophrenia, including in its acute form, and the post-natal depression following the birth of the first child I have referred to. In early 1998 she was diagnosed as suffering from a major depression and severe anxiety symptoms. 
     
      
    8 It is common ground from a number of witnesses that her marriage was an extremely happy relationship, in which her husband cared for her, and she described him as her best friend and lover. The relatives observing that relationship noted the mutuality of love and care between the partners to the marriage. All noted that her condition improved after she became pregnant with Rachael and that, upon Rachael's birth, she showed immense happiness and great tenderness and care for the child. So much, however, did she care for her child that she increasingly became bizarre in her views as to others not caring or being unable to care for the child when in its vicinity. In particular her worries focused on her mother-in-law. 
     
      
    9 She recommenced smoking, she was having difficulty sleeping, she patently became more and more worried and attended a private hospital, her husband having taken her there, complaining of vomiting, anxiety, conflict within the family and spinal pain. 
     
      
    10 Again, on 28 January 1999, some days later, her husband took her to the same hospital where some details of her psychiatric history were given. She was then diagnosed as suffering from post-natal depression, prescribed Prozac, and a recommendation was given that she see her general practitioner for follow-up treatment. It is patent from all the material that the depth and extent of her condition was not fully recognised at that time. 
     
      
    11 In accordance with that recommendation, her husband took her to see a general practitioner on 1 February 1999. That practitioner was given the history of panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, inappropriate mood and a history of depression. That doctor diagnosed insomnia, agitation and anxiety and prescribed Prothiaden, an anti-depressant, and also advised a follow-up. 
     
      
    12 Unfortunately, the prescribed drug of choice was not available and the doctor gave an authority to a pharmacist to substitute Dothep, and following a further contact by Mrs. Pope's husband with the doctor, Valium in addition was prescribed.  
     
      
    13 On 3 February 1999, Mrs. Pope's relatives visited her. They noticed she was agitated and panicky, smoking, continually drinking tea and apparently she had taken a quantity of Valium already and it was decided that the Valium should be hidden in order to avoid her overdosing.  
     
      
    14 On Thursday 4 February 1999, when Mrs. Pope's mother went to collect her first child to take him to school, Mrs. Pope was still in bed and appeared to be depressed. Her mother took Rachael for the day to enable Mrs. Pope to sleep. However, when her mother returned to the premises that afternoon she could not rouse Mrs. Pope and contacted her husband. An ambulance was called and she was taken to the Baulkham Hills Private Hospital where she was kept overnight. She had overdosed on a number of drugs. She was released with advice to see her general practitioner and psychologist.  
     
      
    15 Again, it appears the extent and nature of the severe condition affecting her was not fully realised. Her husband stayed home to care for her on the 5 February and was with her during the weekend. He took her, on the afternoon of the Saturday, to a chiropractor and thereafter she slept until 11.30 the following day. She appeared to be fine on the Sunday.  
     
      
    16 On the Monday she appeared to her mother to be a bit better. The deceased child was dressed and in her bouncer and Mrs. Pope was caring for her. Mrs. Pope said she was going to stay home for the day and do some housework.  
     
      
    17 About 8.45 am that morning she telephoned a pharmacy enquiring as to whether she could pay by cheque to have her prescription for Prozac filled. She also bought a box of Mersyndol and a herbal stress relief product. Upon attending the pharmacy at about 10.30 she appeared to the pharmacist to be ""glassy-eyed"", as though she had already taken something. She was sold the Mersyndol. It is possible she may have bought more Mersyndol at another pharmacy.  
     
      
    18 Her husband rang her during the morning to check on her. She told him she had been to see the chiropractor. However, she had missed the appointment, telling the chiropractor she could not go because she was vomiting. Her mother rang around lunchtime; she rang a number of times and there was no answer so she became alarmed and decided to go to check.  
     
      
    19 When she arrived she knocked; there was no answer. She used her own key to unlock the door but couldn't enter because the safety chain was on. She had never known her daughter to use this during the day. She called out but could get no answer. In due course she smashed a window next to the front door to effect entry.  
     
      
    20 She found Mrs. Pope unconscious in bed. She contacted her son in law. She was unable to find the child. She saw empty boxes of Mersyndol and other things on the kitchen bench. She attempted to rouse and interrogate her daughter. The best information she could get in the condition in which Mrs. Pope was, was a statement that the baby was ""at Linda's"". This appeared to be a reference to a family friend. 
     
      
    21 She asked her son in law for the name of the psychiatrist who had treated her daughter in the past. She contacted that psychiatrist, Doctor Teoh, and gave him the history. Her husband went to Linda's only to find that she had been out all day. When he returned to the home he found that the baby had still not been located. He became highly distressed but, notwithstanding that, was persuaded to return to Linda's in case there had been a misunderstanding. 
     
      
    22 Mrs. Pope's sister had collected the elder child from school and when they returned to the home the baby was located, fully clothed, lying in water in the baby's bath, the lid of which had been closed, hiding her from view. That bath is part of a combined nappy change table and bath unit on a trolley. The nappy change table forms a lid, which fits down over the bath.  
     
      
    23 Mrs. Pope's mother called the police and the ambulance. Mrs. Pope was taken to Westmead Hospital where she was admitted and treated, she being plainly in need of emergency treatment. In due course she was transferred to Cumberland Hospital and remained there under treatment, as I have already said, until February 2000. She was treated by a number of doctors.  
     
      
    24 Doctor Michael Kluger, who had treated her during that period, was of the view that she had suffered from a post-natal psychotic episode of an essentially schizophrenic type and subsequently developed a dissociative amnesia. In consequence, she was unable to recall any of the events leading to Rachael's death, or what she did. She was told of the baby's death only some time after she had been admitted to hospital and refused for some time to accept that information.  
     
      
    25 An investigation of a most detailed kind was carried out by Detective Sergeant McFadden to provide a report to the New South Wales Coroner. That report, which is numbered 10 in the materials forming part of Exhibit A, sets out the prior history of the matter in considerable detail. It noted that the bond between Karen and Rachael Pope was strong and positive. There was no suggestion of hostility in the relationship; the wider family network was supportive and adoring of Rachael; that Karen Pope had a history of mental illness which had included prior overdoses and referred to her admission to St. John of God Hospital at Richmond in 1985, an admission to Cumberland Hospital in 1988, where she was diagnosed as having an acute relapse of schizophrenia and in 1998 the treatment by Doctor Teoh, the psychiatrist to whom I have referred, who treated her in particular, for major depression and severe anxiety. 
     
      
    26 The report further noted that her condition improved and stabilised during the course of the pregnancy and after the birth of Rachael. Reference is made to her depression, including focusing upon a perceived inability of her mother-in-law to be able to hold the baby adequately. The report particularly refers to the attendances at the private hospital to which I have already referred, and the diagnosis of Doctor Cimen of 28 January 1999, who then assessed her at that hospital as suffering from ""post partum depression"", at a time at which that doctor prescribed Prozac and referred her to a psychiatrist. The general practitioner to whom I have already referred was also of the view that she was then suffering from depression. 
     
      
    27 Doctor Amor, on 4 February 1999, on a further attendance at that private hospital, diagnosed her as suffering from post-natal depression. The pharmacist at the pharmacy she attended when she filled the prescription for Prozac described her as being ""under stress and indicated depressive suicidal tendencies"".  
     
      
    28 Specifically dealing with particular issues, Detective McFadden was able to ascertain that the extent of the illness she had suffered was such as to verge upon her totally lacking mental responsibility for her actions. He was able to ascertain that the family, including her husband and the more extended family, were entirely supportive and of assistance to her, and that there was no suggestion of any matter which might in any way have caused the child to be at risk, except her mother's mental condition. 
     
      
    29 It was in those circumstances then, and following the interview which the offender conducted with the police on 27 May 1999, that medical reports were obtained from psychiatrists in respect of the possible diagnoses. They confirm what is set out in the report by Detective McFadden. Doctor Teoh confirmed that she had suffered from a severe psychotic illness; he had been seeing her on a monthly basis after her discharge from a psychiatric hospital on 22 February 2000; at that hospital she was treated for chronic schizophrenia. 
     
      
    30 He records, in considerable detail, the medical background to his diagnosis, including the reference to her having become catatonic, that is to say, withdrawn and immobile, a condition which was treated, as I have already referred to, by the bouts of electroconvulsive therapy. He referred to the long history of psychotic illness on her part.  
     
      
    31 From my viewpoint, when dealing with what course should now be taken, he importantly refers to the fact that Mrs. Pope has been attending her appointments with him on a regular basis since discharge from hospital. She has not missed any appointment, has been compliant with her medication under the supervision of her husband, who has been extremely supportive, and he refers to the assistance provided to the family by relatives. 
     
      
    32 Doctor Bruce Westmore, who is a most respected practitioner in this field, reviews the medical history and the history of the pregnancy, together with the offender's personal history. He concludes, following a mental state examination and in the light of the extensive documentation, which includes reference to the opinions of the other medical practitioners, that she suffered from a psychotic illness, and still does; that she suffered at the time of the acts causing death from post-natal depression in a severe form. 
     
      
    33 The differential diagnosis he expressed would include major depression with psychotic symptoms or schizophrenic illness with a significant mood component, which I apprehend would be depression. He concludes that her illness was such as might have totally deprived her of the capacity to know that she ought not to act towards her child as she did and that her capacity to understand right and wrong was also likely to have been affected. Certainly he said she suffered from an acute psychotic illness with a depression of mood with catatonic features.  
     
      
    34 He concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, her illnesses played a primary role in any action she took towards her daughter and that she will obviously require long-term close psychiatric support and supervision. He refers again to her husband's willingness to assist and supervise her.  
     
      
    35 This plenitude of material quite sufficiently establishes that this is a matter which, in accordance with the principles referred to in such cases as Regina v. Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A. Crim. R. 81, Regina v. Letteri (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March 1992) and Regina v. Engert (1995) 84 A. Crim. R. 67, should be treated as involving limited reference to any matter of personal or general deterrence. 
     
      
    36 A person suffering from an illness such as this, so affecting their responsibility for their actions, is not an appropriate person either to deter from acting in this fashion by the punitive sanctions of the law or to be made an example of to others in order to deter them from acting in this way.  
     
      
    37 There is no suggestion in this case of any lapse of any culpable kind that arose otherwise than by reason of the illness. It is not suggested the offence was rationally pre-meditated. Mrs. Pope had, prior to these events, not offended against the criminal law and she has, by her plea and by her actions, evinced deep contrition and regret at what has happened to her child at her hands by reason of her illness. 
     
      
    38 The objective gravity of the crime must be considered in the light of the limited culpability of an offender who bears so little responsibility for their acts. Given that one must, however, remain aware that the offender is responsible for an act which took the life of another person and which, but for the abnormality of mind, involved in any such crime as is mitigated by diminished responsibility or as here, by the lack of balance of mind, would bear the character of murder.  
     
      
    39 It is accepted that the plea was entered at the first real opportunity. It is accepted that the plea is of utility. One would, indeed, conclude that the Crown case, on any charge but this, would almost certainly have failed.  
     
      
    40 It is to be accepted also that the sanction the criminal law applies will be an additional burden to Mrs. Pope because she will remain stigmatised by the fact of her conviction even, given that I conclude, as it has been submitted to me by the Director of Public Prosecutions and by counsel for the offender, that I should, that the appropriate course to take is to require Mrs Pope to enter into a bond but, one of the terms of which will be that she submit herself to a further supervising agency, to wit, the Probation and Parole Service.  
     
      
    41 In that regard I note that for the assistance of the family and in particular having regard to the welfare of the child that has been born to Mrs. Pope and her husband since these events and that of Mrs. Pope's older child, there has been entered into voluntarily a care plan registered pursuant to the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 at the Children's Court, Lidcombe. That care plan contains detailed provision for assistance and supervision to the family by officers of the Department of Community Services, officers from the Local Area Health Service and members of the families of both Mr. and Mrs. Pope. That supervision is continuous and will continue for quite a long while. 
     
      
    42 That is to ensure not only the welfare of the children, but also in order to ensure the welfare of the children, the welfare of the family unit, and that involves the welfare of Mr. and Mrs. Pope.  
     
      
    43 In the circumstances the appropriate course, as I have indicated, is that I should accept the submission and make an order for a bond pursuant to s.9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in lieu of imposing a sentence of imprisonment. The term of such a or bond must not exceed five years. 
     
      
    44 Part 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies to bonds so ordered. That Part provides that it is necessary, on making such an order, that the bond contain a condition that the offender to whom the bond relates will appear before a court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond and must contain a condition that during the term of the bond the person under bond will be of good behaviour and will inform the court in which the bond is imposed of any change in the residential address, and may contain such other conditions as are specified. 
     
      
    45 It is necessary under s.96 of that Act that it be explained to Mrs. Pope the obligations under the bond and the consequences that may follow. 
     
      
    46 Mrs. Pope, under that bond, you are required to be of good behaviour and to inform of any change of address and to appear if called on. I explain to you also that it will be necessary for you to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service in respect of the matters that I shall refer to in a few moments' time.  
     
      
    47 The consequences are that if you fail to comply with those conditions, you could be brought back to court and sentenced according to law, the possible sentences include a number of sanctions, including imprisonment. In the event that there is a breach of the bond, a warrant may be issued for arrest and the court may, unless there are some reasons for excusing such a breach, proceed to enforce the bond by passing sentence in the way in which I have stipulated. 
     
      
    48 In summary, the medical evidence discloses such a severe condition that the court would not be warranted in law in imposing any other penalty than that bond and, therefore, I now pass sentence formally in terms of s.9 requiring you, Mrs. Pope, to enter into a bond for a period of three years, subject to the conditions to which I have referred concerning cal up, good behaviour and notifying residential address, and a further condition requiring you, for the duration of the bond or such lesser period as your supervising officer may think fit, to submit yourself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and to obey reasonable directions of that Service, in particular concerning medical and psychiatric assistance to be provided to you and concerning compliance with the registered care plan.  
     
      
    49 In that regard it will be necessary for you to report to the relevant local Probation and Parole Service Office within 14 days of today's date. That office in your case is located at Parramatta; you should call by appointment to that office.  
     
      
    50 You will have to enter into the bond at the registry and bail will continue until that recognisance is entered.

      REGINA v Christopher David MYERS 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J:  Christopher David Myers (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed by Garling DCJ on 24 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 Mr Myers pleaded guilty to 11 sexual offences involving under age males. The sentence was partly cumulative and partly concurrent. It was structured in a way that I will shortly describe. The term, in total, was for 8 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
      
       
        
       Background 
        
       
     3 The offences took place between 1995 and 5 December 1999. Four of the victims were brothers. The remaining victim was a friend of the youngest brother. The ages of the victims, at the time of each offence, varied between 11 years and 18 years. To preserve the anonymity of the victims I will refer to them by an initial. 
      
       
     4 Mr Myers met one brother (T) in 1993. By this means he got to know the family. He then formed a relationship with T's mother. In 1996, he moved in with the family. He became, in effect, a step-father to four of the victims. 
      
       
     5 The oldest brother (P) was born in 1979. The youngest (B) was born in December 1984. There were two brothers in between, T (1980) and K (1981). The friend of the youngest brother (S) was born in February 1985. 
      
       
        
       The Offences 
        
       
     6 The charges were grouped, according to victim. The first three counts related to one of the brothers, T, the second oldest (born 1980). The first offence occurred when T was 14 or 15. Both he and the applicant were staying in a flat belonging to the applicant's father. T was provided with alcohol by the applicant. During the night, the applicant called T to his bedroom. He was in bed, undressed, holding his penis. The applicant was then a man aged about 31. He asked T to join him in bed. T felt obliged to do so. The applicant then touched T's penis. He inserted his finger in T's anus. They then masturbated each other to ejaculation. 
      
       
     7 The charge was brought under s66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act). The maximum penalty under the section is 8 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years, commencing on 22 May 2001. He declined to fix a non-parole period. 
      
       
     8 The second charge involved an incident which took place a short time after the first. At the same flat, each masturbated the other. T was then 14 or 15 years old. The offence charged was that of aggravated indecent assault (s61M(1) of the Act). The maximum penalty for that offence was 7 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years. It was a concurrent sentence, commencing on the same date as count 1 (22 August 2001). No non-parole period was fixed. 
      
       
     9 The third charge concerned an offence under s78Q(1) of the Act. It alleged an act of gross indecency involving T and another brother, K. It took place at the applicant's work place, a factory. At the request of the applicant, T and K masturbated themselves in front of a video camera, which the applicant operated, the image appearing on a television screen. 
      
       
     10 The facts agreed acknowledged that these were not isolated incidents. The statement of facts included the following (substituting initials for the name which appeared): 
      
       
        
         
         ""Sexual contact between the accused and (T) involving masturbation took place on other occasions between the period of 1995 until towards the end of 1999. This activity took place at various houses at which the family resided and at the Rydalmere factory."" 
         
        
       
     11 The maximum penalty under s78Q(1) was 2 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 1 year, concurrent, that is commencing on 22 August 2001. For the same reasons, his Honour declined to fix a non-parole period. 
      
       
     12 The next two charges related to the third brother, K, born in 1981. Count 4 alleged that, between November 1995 and July 1996, K was at the flat. Mr Myers took the victim to dinner at McDonalds. They went by car. Together they entered the garage at the premises. K got in the car. Soon after he did so, Mr Myers touched his penis. He then removed K's pants. He placed two fingers in K's anus. The applicant then masturbated himself and placed his penis against K. K was, at the time, 13 or 14 years old. 
      
       
     13 The charge in count 4 was of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 (s66C(1) of the Act). The maximum penalty was 8 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 3 years, concurrent with the term imposed in earlier counts. No non-parole period was fixed. 
      
       
     14 The fifth count was based upon the same incident as count 3. However, it related to the victim, K. It charged that, in May 1998, at a time when K was 16 years and his brother 17 years, the applicant induced the two brothers to masturbate in front of a video, the image being transmitted onto a screen. The charge was under s78Q(1) of the Act. The maximum penalty was 2 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 1 year, commencing on 22 August 2001, so that it was concurrent with terms previously imposed. 
      
       
     15 The sixth and seventh counts concerned the oldest brother, P. P, at the time of each incident, was 18 years old. Both counts charged indecent assault of P (s61L). Count six alleged that, in March 1998, P went to work for a few days with the applicant at a factory. The work involved staying overnight in the factory. P had a shower in the toilet block, using a makeshift shower connection. The applicant entered the block and showered next to P. In the course of doing so, he touched P's penis. The maximum penalty under the section is 5 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment, concurrent with the terms previously imposed. No non-parole period was set. 
      
       
     16 The seventh count involved an incident between April and October 1998. In the course of paying money to P, the applicant placed his hand and the money down P's trousers, touching his penis. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 22 August 2001. 
      
       
     17 The eighth and ninth counts concerned the youngest brother, B. The eighth count was the most serious. It occurred in 1996 at a time when Mr Myers had formed a relationship with B's mother. He had moved into the family home. He was, therefore, in a position of authority in relation to B. During a period that B's mother was absent from the house, and he was tucking B into bed, he pulled B's pants down. He touched him on the penis and then sucked his penis. 
      
       
     18 The maximum penalty for sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years is 8 years (s61C(1)). Where it occurs, as here, in circumstances where the perpetrator is also in a position of authority, the maximum penalty is increased to 10 years. His Honour imposed a term of 5 years. He made the term cumulative upon the longest of the fixed terms which he had imposed, that is, the terms of 3 years imposed concurrently in respect of counts 1 and 4. So the 5 year fixed term commenced on 22 August 2004. It expired on 21 August 2009. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 2 years, expiring on 21 August 2006. 
      
       
     19 The ninth count related to an incident approximately three years later. It charged that, between 1 January 1999 and 7 December 1999, the applicant committed the crime of aggravated indecent assault (s61M(1)). The assault occurred on a camping trip with B and S, a young friend of B. B, by that time, was 15 years old. His friend, S, was 13 or 14. The applicant masturbated both B and S. They then masturbated him. 
      
       
     20 Again the statement of facts makes it plain that the conduct, so far as B was concerned, occurred on other occasions. The statement included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Sexual contact between the accused and (B) involving masturbation took place on other occasions, at various houses at which the family resided and at the Rydalmere factory, between 1996 and 7 December 1999."" 
         
        
       
     21 The maximum penalty under the section was 7 years. His Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 2-1/2 years, concurrent with the terms imposed in respect of counts other than count 8, that is, commencing from 22 August 2001. No non-parole period was fixed. 
      
       
     22 Counts 10 and 11 concerned the victim S, B's friend. Both counts were charges of aggravated indecent assault (s61M(1)). Count 10 related to an incident in the first half of 1998. S was staying the night at his friend's home. He was then 12 or 13 years old. The applicant came into the bedroom and touched S's penis. The applicant also got S to touch his, the applicant's, penis. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 2-1/2 years to commence on 22 August 2001. The term was, therefore concurrent with all counts other than count 8. No non-parole period was fixed. 
      
       
     23 The final charge, count 11, related to the camping trip described in relation to the offences committed against B (count 9). At the time of that incident S was 13 or 14 years old and his friend, B, 15 years old. 
      
       
     24 Again, the statement of facts makes it plain that the incident was not an isolated occurrence. The statement said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Sexual contact between the accused and (S) involving masturbation took place on other occasions between January 1998 and 7 December 1999."" 
         
        
        
       The Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     25 In helpful written submissions, counsel for the applicant identified the grounds of complaint in respect of the sentence imposed by his Honour, in these words: 
      
       
     · The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's attempts at rehabilitation prior to sentence via the counselling he undertook. 
      
       
     · The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient discount for the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     · Alternatively that if the appropriate discount was given the starting point for the sentence was too high. 
      
       
     · The sentence imposed offended the principles in R v Pearce (1998) HCA 57. 
      
       
     · The total sentence and its component parts are manifestly excessive. 
      
       
       Analysis of Complaints 
        
       
     26 Submissions on sentence were made on 22 August 2001. His Honour reserved. He then imposed the sentence under appeal on 24 August 2001, having been provided with a number of authorities by both the Crown and counsel for Mr Myers. 
      
       
     27 His Honour's remarks on sentence include a careful analysis of the objective seriousness of the offences. There were five victims, some very young. There were multiple offences in which certain counts were identified as representative of a number of similar acts. His Honour considered the explanation provided by Mr Myers. He could not completely accept that explanation. He said this: (p 11) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me that the prisoner has yet to come totally to grips with what he actually did."" 
         
        
       
     28 It was plain that Mr Myers systematically abused his victims for his own sexual gratification. His Honour, appropriately, in my view, said this: (p13) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Whilst this does not fall into the class of the worst types of abuse which the courts see in these type of charges, it is extremely serious and demands a very lengthy term of imprisonment."" 
         
        
       
     29 The subjective case of the applicant was, as counsel contends, strong. Mr Myers was, at the time of trial, a man aged 37 years. He had no criminal convictions. He was highly regarded by persons with whom he worked, and those who knew him in the community. His prospects of rehabilitation were, in my view, given appropriate weight, and were regarded as good. Mr Myers, in his letter of explanation addressed to the Court, referred to his attempts in prison to obtain counselling assistance. The psychologist who had seen him, referred to, as his Honour acknowledged, ""a consistent commitment to the counselling process"", adding that counselling had been of considerable benefit to the applicant. 
      
       
     30 His Honour did not quantify the discount for the plea of guilty. However, he certainly did not undervalue that plea. He said this: (p 9) 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is a valuable plea, it is also of value that he admitted the offences at any early time and co-operated and accordingly in accordance with the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal I will allow him the maximum deduction recommended there upon his sentence."" 
         
        
       
     31 I assume that his Honour allowed, therefore, a discount of 25% (as suggested by R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383). I do not believe that there is warrant for any greater discount. I will approach the sentence upon this footing. 
      
       
     32 The real grievance of the applicant is the suggested departure from Pearce v The Queen (1994) 194 CLR 610, and the suggestion that the sentence imposed was too severe. The principle in Pearce v The Queen was conveniently summarised by Simpson J in R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, where her Honour said this: (at 67) 
      
       
        
         
         ""Following  
         Pearce 
         , a judge is required to fix 'an appropriate sentence' for each offence, before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. I take this to mean that, except perhaps in cases of multiple offences committed as part of a single, discrete, episode of criminality, the sentence for an individual offence is to reflect the criminality involved in the offence untainted by reference to the other offences for which that offender is to be sentenced."" 
         
        
       
     33 Here, his Honour made the following statement shortly before identifying the sentences imposed in respect of each count. His Honour said: (p 14) 
      
       
        
         
         ""The total criminality of these offences in my view require an extremely severe sentence. I will structure the sentence in due course, however you will be sentenced overall to a term of imprisonment of eight years with a non-parole period taking into account the special circumstances of five years. I now structure the sentences in this way to reflect that."" 
         
        
       
     34 Pearce required that certain things be considered, when imposing sentence, and that they be considered in a particular order: 
      
       
     · First, each offence must be considered separately, and an appropriate sentence determined. 
      
       
     · Secondly, consideration must be given as to whether the sentences imposed should be made concurrent or cumulative (or partially one or the other). It will be appropriate, for instance, to make sentences for offences concurrent where, although separate, they are substantially contemporaneous and connected. 
      
       
     · Thirdly, the principle of totality must be considered. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved (R v AEM Snr & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58, para 70; R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152, per Sully J at 184). The mechanism of making some sentences cumulative, and others concurrent (or partly so), may be used where, as often happens, and as happened in this case, the aggregate of sentences imposed in respect of each count exceeds the appropriate total sentence. 
      
       
     35 Here, I believe that his Honour approached the matter as required by Pearce. In the passage quoted, his Honour was simply providing Mr Myers, in advance, with the result which then emerged from the sentences which were imposed on each count. His Honour's remarks, and the structure of the sentence, indicate that he considered the question of concurrence and accumulation, as well as totality. 
      
       
     36 It is said on behalf of Mr Myers that his Honour's sentence on count 8 was too high, especially when one allows for the plea of guilty and a discount of 25%. It was the equivalent of 6.25 years. However, I do not believe that it was too high. His Honour was required to sentence for an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse involving an 11 year old boy, committed in circumstances of aggravation, namely, the betrayal of trust arising from Mr Myers' position, which was effectively that of step-father. 
      
       
     37 Even were it thought that the individual penalty imposed upon this or other counts were too high, the total sentence, in my view, is certainly not too high (cf s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). Mr Myers was guilty of a sustained abuse of five victims, some quite young, over a number of years. 
      
       
     38 In the course of argument, the Court has been taken to the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission. The statistics have their place. However, they are, as the Court recently remarked, ""a blunt instrument"" (R v AEM Snr & Ors (supra) para 113). Care must be exercised in their use. I do not believe that the statistics suggest that the sentences imposed were outside the discretion given to his Honour. Specifically, I believe the total sentence imposed (8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years) to be well within that discretion. 
      
       
        
       Order 
        
       
     39 The order I would therefore propose is as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. That leave to appeal should be given. 
        
        
       2. But the appeal should be dismissed. 
        
       
     40 SMART AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     41 KIRBY J: The order of the Court will be as outlined by me.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J: James Anthony Hanslow (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ on 28 May 1999. He also seeks an extension of time to prosecute this appeal. 
      
       
     2 Mr Hanslow stood trial before Gibson DCJ and a jury on two counts, as follows: 
      
       
     · First, a charge under s 61B of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act) that, in late 1989, he assaulted a girl under the age of 10 years, with intent to have sexual intercourse. 
      
       
     · Secondly, a charge under s 61E(1) of the Act that, in late 1989, on the same day, he committed an act of indecency upon the same young girl. 
      
       
     3 Mr Hanslow pleaded not guilty. However, after a short trial in April 1999, he was found guilty on both counts. In respect of the first and more serious count, Mr Hanslow was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two and a half years, such term to be served by way of Periodic Detention commencing on 11 June 1999. On the second count, that of indecent assault, his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months, also to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing on the same date, that is, 11 June 1999 (Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981) (since repealed). 
      
       
     4 Mr Hanslow's history since that sentence was imposed has been complicated. On 12 July 2001, the Parole Board revoked the order for periodic detention. Mr Hanslow is now in full time custody. 
      
       
     5 Before describing the circumstances which led the Parole Board to revoke that order, I should describe the offences themselves. 
      
       
        
       The Offences 
        
       
     6 In late 1989, Mr Hanslow was sixteen years old. He had a younger sister. She was friendly with a girl who lived next door. That girl, the complainant, was nine years old. Both her parents worked. She frequently came to the Hanslow home after school, before her parents arrived home from work. 
      
       
     7 In 1989, the complainant came to the Hanslow house. Mr Hanslow suggested a game. He began dancing with the complainant to music. In what his Honour described as an impulsive act, Mr Hanslow pulled the complainant close to him. He rubbed the outside of her clothing near her breasts. He then kissed her. These actions gave rise to the second count, that of indecent assault. His Honour described the offence as being ""at the bottom of the range"" of seriousness. 
      
       
     8 Mr Hanslow then took the complainant to a bedroom. He removed his shorts and her underwear. He lay on top of her, attempting to insert his penis into her vagina. He did not succeed. The complainant was scared. She protested. However, Mr Hanslow ignored her protests. After several minutes he got off her and went to the bathroom. 
      
       
     9 The complainant said that she would not tell anyone. And she did not do so until 1997. The trial, as mentioned, took place in 1999, that is, ten years after these events. 
      
       
     10 In that ten years Mr Hanslow has had a somewhat checkered history. He obtained his School Certificate. He also obtained part of the qualification as a diesel mechanic. From the age of seventeen he began living with his wife in what appears to be a stable relationship. They had two young children at the time he was required to face these charges. A third child has since been born. 
      
       
     11 Mr Hanslow, however, had difficulty with alcohol and drugs. In 1991 he was charged with driving whilst affected to a high level by alcohol. He was required to serve 100 hours community service. In 1997 he was convicted of driving whilst disqualified. An order was made requiring a further 100 hours community service. In April 1999, shortly before his trial, he was again convicted of driving whilst under the influence, and whilst disqualified. An order for periodic detention was made. His Honour structured the sentence so that the order for periodic detention, which he imposed, would commence upon the expiration of the previous order. 
      
       
        
       Events since the Sentence 
        
       
     12 Two affidavits have been admitted describing Mr Hanslow's attempts to fulfil his obligation to attend for periodic detention. The first is an affidavit by Mr Hanslow of 5 April 2002, and the second an affidavit by his wife, Ms Jennifer O'Brien of 30 April 2002. 
      
       
     13 Mr Hanslow's affidavit annexes a copy of his attendance record in respect of periodic detention. Mr Hanslow was ordered to attend the Wollongong Periodic Detention Centre at Unanderra on 11 June 1999. He appears not to have done so for the first two weeks. However, he thereafter did attend between 25 June 1999 and 14 May 2000, apart from occasions when he was granted leave of absence or excused upon the basis that he was sick. 
      
       
     14 The circumstances which caused Mr Hanslow not to attend for periodic detention are described by him and his wife in their affidavits. When the order was made, he was living in Moruya. He caught the bus from Moruya at 8.00 am on a Friday. He attended the Centre at Unanderra on twelve occasions. On one occasion he was called to the prison office to sign papers. Two other inmates were present in the office. The papers he signed recorded the offences for which he had been convicted. The papers were seen by the other inmates. And so it was that other inmates became aware that Mr Hanslow had been convicted of sexual offences involving a child. 
      
       
     15 Mr Hanslow thereafter was taunted by other inmates. He was also assaulted. The Department recognised his predicament. They arranged for him to complete his periodic detention at Parramatta. The journey from Moruya to Parramatta absorbed the whole of each Friday. Unfortunately, however, the journey home involved the same train used by inmates from Unanderra. He was harassed on that journey. The police were called to the train on one occasion. He was obliged to make arrangements for his brother to pick him up on another. 
      
       
     16 Both Mr Hanslow and his wife describe their fears for their own and their children's safety. Mr Hanslow was abused by neighbours. His car was scratched. He approached the Department to seek its assistance. He was told that the only alternative was to cancel the Periodic Detention order and serve the balance of his sentence fulltime. 
      
       
     17 This was plainly unpalatable advice. Mr Hanslow and his wife instead chose to leave the area. That involved his wife leaving her job which she had held for some ten years. They moved north. However, on 14 May 2001, Mr Hanslow was arrested for a number of serious driving offences. He was found to be driving whilst affected by alcohol (high range), and whilst disqualified, and at a speed which was dangerous. In respect of those offences, he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, to commence on 13 May 2001, and to expire on 12 February 2002. A non-parole period of six months was fixed to expire on 12 November 2001. 
      
       
     18 Mr Hanslow's arrest naturally brought to light his failure to attend for periodic detention. The Parole Board revoked the periodic detention order. Giving credit for time served, the Board fixed the balance of his sentence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1: A fixed term of two years and eighteen days to commence on 13 May 2001, and expire on 30 May 2003. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2: A fixed term of three months and sixteen days to commence on 13 May 2001, and expire on 28 August 2001. 
         
        
        
       The Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     19 The notice of appeal does not set out the grounds of appeal. Using the written submissions made on behalf of the applicant as a guide, the grounds of appeal are as follows: 
      
       
     · First, that his Honour was in error in failing to fix a minimum term and an additional term. 
      
       
     · Secondly, that his Honour was in error in failing to give reasons for not fixing a minimum term. 
      
       
     · Thirdly, and alternatively, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       The Legislative Requirements 
        
       
     20 Before going to his Honour's remarks on sentence, I should say something about the change in the law, as it related to periodic detention, which commenced operation on 1 February 1999, that is a matter of months before his Honour sentenced Mr Hanslow on 28 May 1999. In R v Bang (unreported, CCA, 1.9.92), Badgery-Parker J said this: (at 17-18) 
      
       
        
         
         “A literal interpretation of the provisions of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981, might be thought to require a sentencing judge to engage upon a two stage process: first, to determine the appropriate sentence of imprisonment, and then, having reached a conclusion about that, to undertake examination of the question whether in the circumstances of the particular case that sentence ought be served by way of periodic detention. Indeed, I think it is correct to say that that approach was regularly adopted by judges of the District Court and of the Supreme Court over a period of years without criticism from the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
         
        
       
     21 Nonetheless, recognition that an order for periodic detention involved an element of leniency tended to blur the two stage process. Allen J, in R v Sadebath (unreported, CCA, 14.5.92), said this: (at 7-8) 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless it (periodic detention) is severe punishment. Insofar as the severity of the hardship caused by it during the time it is being served is less than it is in the case of a full-time custodial sentence, that disparity can be dealt with by increasing the length of the periodic sentence.” 
         
        
       
     22 However, the amendment in 1998 to the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981, with operation from 1 February 1999, made it plain that, thenceforth, a two-stage approach was required. The Attorney, in the Second Reading Speech, said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “The intention of section 5(1) is that the sentence of imprisonment should be determined first, and only then should consideration be given to whether the person serves the sentence in full-time imprisonment or by way of periodic detention. Despite the wording of section 5(1), interpretation of the section by the courts has been variable, thereby reducing the diversionary effect of periodic detention. The bill repeals section 5(1) and inserts new sections, including new section 5(1A), which requires a court to set a fixed term or a minimum and an additional term before making a periodic detention order. Offenders sentenced to periodic detention will therefore be in no doubt, from the outset, as to the term they face in full-time custody if they fail to attend periodic detention.” 
         
        
       
     23 The same amendment introduced another important change. Whereas a prisoner in breach of an order for periodic detention had, in the past, been brought back before a Judge (often the sentencing Judge), after February 1999 such breaches were dealt with administratively. The Parole Board was given the power to revoke an order for periodic detention and calculate the term which remained, giving credit for time spent on periodic detention. That is what occurred in this case. 
      
       
     24 Thenceforth the practice described by Allen J of compensating for the leniency of periodic detention by extending the term of imprisonment could not be followed. 
      
       
        
       The Sentence Imposed 
        
       
     25 Here, we do not have amongst the appeal papers the transcript of the sentencing proceedings. It would appear, however, that his Honour's attention was not drawn to the recent changes in the legislation. I believe, as a matter of inference, that the sentence imposed by his Honour reflected the sentencing practice before the February 1999 amendment. I say this for a number of reasons. First, his Honour's remarks on sentence included the following exchange, which is obviously a reference to the previous practice rather than the regime introduced a few months before: 
      
       
        
         
         ""You will understand, you have probably been told this, but you will understand that if you do not present yourself on that day or if you do not carry out the periodic detention or if you go there affected by alcohol or affected by drugs, that you will come back before me and you will do it full time. Do you understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         PRISONER: Yes.” 
         
        
       
     26 Secondly, it is apparent from his Honour's remarks that he intended to extend a measure of leniency to Mr Hanslow in making the order of periodic detention. His Honour said this: (p 4) 
      
       
        
         
         “I think that in the totality of the circumstances of this case that a custodial sentence is required and I am also of the opinion that in the light of his age at the time and the position that he now is in, that custodial sentence can be served by way of periodic detention, so I propose and I impose on him a sentence of fixed term of two and a half years.” 
         
        
       
     27 These remarks do not, or do not unambiguously, reflect the two stage approach introduced in February 1999. After that time, a sentencing Judge was required, first, to fix an appropriate period of imprisonment. He or she was then required to give consideration to whether the sentence could be appropriately carried out in circumstances other than full time custody. It was no longer appropriate to telescope those issues, extending the term of imprisonment to compensate for the leniency involved in periodic detention (R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405). Yet, I believe, the terms of imprisonment imposed have been extended in accordance with the previous practice. Alternatively, the terms imposed were excessive. 
      
       
     28 I believe that error has been established, and that it is necessary for the Court to re-sentence. 
      
       
        
       Re-Sentencing 
        
       
     29 The re-sentencing of Mr Hanslow is complicated by the offence which led to his apprehension in May 2001. He was, as mentioned, charged with driving with a high range concentration of alcohol, driving whilst disqualified, and driving at a speed which was dangerous. He was convicted at the Kempsey Local Court of each of these offences. A sentence of nine months imprisonment was imposed, commencing on 13 May 2001 and expiring on 12 February 2002. A non-parole period of six months was fixed, expiring on 12 November 2001. 
      
       
     30 Mr Hanslow had therefore served a significant period of Periodic Detention, before his completion of the sentence was disrupted. The disruption does not reflect adversely upon him, and created significant hardship for him and his family. He did thereafter, of course, simply ignore his obligations under the periodic detention order, and that does reflect adversely upon him. It may, however, be assumed that Mr Hanslow would have been admitted to parole in respect of the driving offences on 12 November 2001. His custody, thereafter, may be assumed to relate to the offences which are now under review. 
      
       
     31 The term in respect of the second count fixed by the Parole Board in July 2001 has since expired (28 August 2001). Nonetheless, since I believe there was error, and the term imposed was excessive, I will re-sentence on that count. 
      
       
     32 In all the circumstances, I am inclined to the view that the time served by Mr Hanslow, whether by periodic detention, or in full time custody, should be regarded as adequate in respect of the criminality involved in respect of counts 1 and 2. I would therefore propose the following order. 
      
       
        
       Order 
        
        
       1. That leave to appeal out of time be granted. 
        
        
       2. That leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
        
        
       3. That the appeal be allowed. 
        
        
       4. That the sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ, as amended by the Parole Board be quashed. 
        
        
       5. That in respect of the first count, Mr Hanslow be re-sentenced to a fixed term commencing on 13 May 2001 and expiring today, 7 May 2002; and in respect of the second count, Mr Hanslow be re-sentenced to a fixed term of 1 month, concurrent, that is commencing on 13 May 2001, and expiring on 12 June 2001. 
        
       
     33 SMART AJ: I agree with Kirby J. I add the following additional reasons. 
      
       
     34 The sentence of two and a half years imprisonment, albeit to be served by periodic detention, imposed on the offence of assault with intent to have sexual intercourse with a child under ten years is manifestly excessive for these reasons: 
      
       
        
       (a) at the time of the offence the applicant was a juvenile aged sixteen years. It is highly improbable, if the matter had been reported promptly, that the applicant would have been sentenced to imprisonment by the Children’s Court. Further, any custodial penalty, if imposed, would have been served in a Juvenile Justice Centre. 
        
        
       (b) the applicant has suffered real prejudice in the delay of almost ten years in standing trial in that he has lost the opportunity of being dealt with in the Children’s Court and its less punitive regime. 
        
        
       (c) by the time the applicant was facing trial he had settled down and also into a regular relationship with his de facto partner and there had been no subsequent acts of sexual aberrancy. 
        
        
       (d) the attempt to have sexual intercourse failed; it is appreciated that the incident was very distressing for the victim. The complainant came into his home when he was alone and not equal to coping with the task. He did not seek her out. 
        
       
     35 Being satisfied that the judge erred in that a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment was not, in the circumstances, permissible, it falls to this Court to re-sentence. 
      
       
     36 The sentence of nine months imprisonment on the indecent assault charge, albeit to be served by periodic detention, is also manifestly excessive. The offence was rightly described by the judge as being at the bottom end of the range. It was an impulsive action by a sixteen year old boy not equipped to deal with the situation he faced. A custodial sentence for the offence would not have been contemplated by the Children’s Court. 
      
       
     37 For the sake of completeness I would add that the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 was repealed by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 (Schedule 1). The provisions of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 (including the 1998 Amending Act) are included in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 6 and the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, Part 3 ss 80 -101 and Schedule 5, Division 2. Clause 20 provides that any order for Periodic Detention that immediately before the appointed day (3 April 2000) was in force under the 1981 Act, is taken to be a Periodic Detention order in force under this Act (the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999). 
      
       
     38 I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby J. 
      
       
     39 KIRBY J: The orders of the court will be as proposed by me.

      REGINA v Carl Rodney SLATTERY 
      
      
       
      
      
      
       
     The appellant was found guilty by a jury of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plants, contrary to s23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was sentenced to a minimum term of one year, ten months and five days imprisonment. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. 
      
       
     It was argued that the appellant provided assistance and/or supplies to unknown persons, with the knowledge that such equipment and supplies would be used in the furtherance of the cultivation of cannabis. The Crown's case at trial was based on the evidence given by police officers as to the existence of the crop site, the statements made by the appellant's former de facto partner and circumstantial evidence.  
      
       
     The appellant alleged that the trial Judge had erred with respect to the directions which had been given to the jury regarding the requisite knowledge of the accused as to the actual cultivation of the cannabis plants. Further, it was claimed that the trial Judge failed adequately to direct the jury that an alternative explanation for the circumstantial evidence must be excluded.  
      
       
     The appellant also relied on medical evidence in order to argue that his defence had been impaired at trial because of profound memory loss. Claims that the evidence of the appellant's former de facto partner and certain police officers was fabricated were also advanced on appeal. 
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Grove J and Simpson J concurring) 
      
       
     1. An analysis of the trial Judge's summing up did not support a finding that his directions cast the onus on the appellant to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with his innocence. There is a fine distinction to be drawn between not finding an accused guilty if there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence and not finding the accused guilty unless there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with innocence. 
      
       
     2. The appellant's claims about his memory loss were inconsistent with much of the evidence which he gave in chief and under cross-examination at trial. The arguments raised about the credibility of the evidence of his former de facto partner were adequately addressed by the trial Judge in his directions to the jury. The claims of fabrication of evidence and profound memory loss were both dealt with at first instance. 
      
       
     3. The appellant's challenge to the sentence imposed by his Honour failed. His claim that the trial Judge did not take into account time served on remand was irrelevant as that time was served in relation to another offence.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       SHELLER JA:  
        
        
       Offence charged 
        
       
     1 The appellant, Carl Rodney Slattery, was charged that between 20 December 1992 and 5 January 1994 at Colo Heights and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales he did knowingly take part in the cultivation of prohibited plants – namely, cannabis plants, the number of which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited plant – contrary to s23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Section 6 provided that for the purposes of the Act “a person takes part in the cultivation ….of a prohibited plant ……if - 
      
       
        
         
         (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation….” 
         
        
       
     2 The appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial began in the District Court before his Honour Judge Knight and a jury on 9 September 1998. On 6 October 1998 the jury found the appellant guilty. On 23 October 1998 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years, four months and five days commencing on that date and expiring on 27 February 2003. A minimum term of one year, ten months and five days expiring on 27 August 2000 was fixed. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. 
      
       
        
       Crown case 
        
       
     3 The appellant was charged with taking part in the cultivation not only at Colo Heights (the crop site) but also at Augusta Street, Strathfield where he resided. There was no direct evidence of any person actively taking part in cultivating the plants of varying size found throughout the bush at the crop site. On 4 January 1994 in the area of the crop site the police heard a pump operating and two male voices. On 5 January 1994 the police raided the site and chased someone. The police did not see anyone at the crop site. The Crown presented its case against the appellant in two ways. First, it relied on circumstantial evidence claimed to link the appellant with the cultivation. Part of the circumstantial evidence was two thumbprints of the appellant on items found at the crop site. Second, the Crown relied on the direct evidence of Carol Duggan. She had had a de facto relationship with the appellant at the time of the alleged offence which broke up in 1996. She swore that the appellant admitted to her that he was at the cannabis plantation and on one occasion was chased out of it by helicopter. She gave evidence that the appellant told her about a glove with a hole in the position where the appellant’s thumbprint would have been.  
      
       
     4 The Crown listed the circumstantial evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The plantation site at Colo Heights was in rugged and isolated terrain difficult to get to and difficult to take things out of. There was irrigation and a flying fox. Water tanks had been constructed. There was a handmade wooden table. Whoever was involved needed knowledge of irrigation and pumps. The appellant’s talents and know-how meant he could have been one of the persons involved in the cultivation.  
        
        
       2. The appellant’s thumbprints were found on a peanut butter jar and on the inside of a hurricane lamp which were at the crop site. The Crown argued that there was a negligible chance of this occurring unless the appellant was connected with the crop site. At the time these prints were found by the police in January 1994, Carol Duggan was on good terms with the appellant and had no motive to plant them. The jar was found amongst other food items at the crop site and the print on the hurricane lamp was imprinted in soot which the Crown said must have happened at the crop site. If the lamp had been lit by anyone else at the crop site, one would have expected the thumbprint to be then covered in soot. In July 1997 the police returned to the area and found a glove with a hole in the right thumb. The appellant’s thumbprints on items at the crop site were right thumbprints. Dr Elizabeth Brown, a botanist, gave evidence of moss growing on the inside of the glove which negated any suggestion that the glove was later planted at the site. Dr Brown had never seen the type of moss growing on the glove in any Sydney metropolitan area, including Strathfield where the appellant had been with Ms Duggan at the residence in Augusta Street. The glove had been in a situation suitable for the growth of that kind of moss for not less than one year and probably much longer. The glove must have been in place with moss growing on it at an earlier time when the appellant and Ms Duggan still had a good relationship.  
        
        
       3. The twirls and criss-cross patterns on a grate found at the crop site matched with one placed over a manhole by the appellant at Augusta Street. The manufacturer of the grates gave evidence that they were exactly the same.  
        
        
       4. The garage at the Augusta Street property was the appellant’s domain. He acknowledged being in the garage tinkering around, fixing parts of lawn mowers and pumps.  
        
        
       5. A Tempest brand radio was found by the police on the table at the crop site. A witness, Luke Montague, said he last saw the radio in the garage at the Augusta Street property.  
        
        
       6. Burnt hessian at the crop site was of “generally similar” appearance to hessian found at the Augusta Street property. 
        
        
       7. Paint on the sprinkler hose bases and air filters from the green pumps found at the crop site were made of a similar colour and similar composition to paint in a can found in the Augusta Street property garage. 
        
        
       8. A freshly painted pump was found in the boot of a vehicle, in which the appellant was a passenger, by Constable Gorman. This pump was later found at the crop site. At the time the pump was found in the boot by Constable Gorman the appellant falsely told him he had picked up his girlfriend because her car had broken down. 
        
        
       9. A map of the crop site area and camouflaged clothing was found at the Augusta Street residence. 
        
        
       10. Two brackets found outside the garage were identical to the mounting bracket on the bases of two pumps found at the crop site. 
        
        
       11. Two plastic drums found at the Augusta Street residence were of the same size and shape as one found at the crop site. The base of the footings of the drums matched an imprint on the garden seat at the crop site. 
        
        
       12. The appellant admitted using glue which was the same as glue found on one of the exhibits. 
        
        
       Draft grounds of appeal 
        
       
     5 On 28 February 2002 the Registrar received a letter from Mr Scott Corish, barrister, referring to a letter that the appellant had written to the Registrar advising that he would be appearing for himself. Mr Corish had prepared submissions for the appellant based on what appear to be draft grounds of appeal and forwarded these to the Court for its assistance without seeking to limit the way in which the appellant put his case. Ground 3 was abandoned. The appellant adopted the other grounds and counsel’s submissions. 
      
       
     6 The draft grounds of appeal were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The learned trial Judge erred with respect to the directions to the jury regarding the requisite knowledge of the accused of cultivation in relation to the provision of goods/equipment or comfort(s) by the accused and, in particular: 
         
        
        
         
         a. failed to adequately direct the jury’s attention to the necessity of finding of knowledge of actual cultivation, and 
         
        
        
         
         b. failed to adequately direct the jury that an alternative explanation must be excluded. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The learned trial Judge erred in directing to the jury with respect to circumstantial evidence by casting the onus on the accused to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with innocence. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to adequately direct the jury with respect to the use of lies attributed to the accused.” 
         
        
        
       
     7 In the written submissions, Mr Corish pointed out that the Crown case was that the appellant provided assistance and/or supplies to unknown persons who were cultivating the crops, by way of supplying or repairing equipment or otherwise providing sustenance and supplies (eg the hurricane lamp or peanut butter in the jar). Allegedly this was done with the knowledge that such equipment and supplies would be used in furtherance of the cultivation of the cannabis. In summary, there were three legs to the Crown case which were: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) The evidence in relation to the crop sites given by police officers as to the existence of the cultivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The evidence of [the appellant’s] former de facto partner, Carol Duggan, in relation to a conversation she had with [the appellant] at Long Bay Gaol in early 1994 to the effect that [the appellant] admitted to her that he was involved in the cultivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The circumstantial evidence which categorised into nineteen points, reiterated to the jury by the trial Judge during his summing up. 
         
        
       
     8 The cannabis was first located by police in September 1993. Police visited the site on several occasions during that month (2, 6 and 29 September 1993) and then later in January 1994. Although the police stated that during the visit to the site on 4 January 1994 they heard a voice and a water pump operating and on 5 January 1994 heard a person running through the bush, no arrests were made. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
     9 Counsel pointed out that the Crown case was based upon the supply of the pump, the supply of other equipment and the supply of comforts. For the jury to be satisfied that it was appropriate to draw the inference that the appellant intended the equipment comforts to be used in the cultivation of cannabis, it was necessary for the trial Judge to have directed the jury that in making the connection between the supply of the equipment and the use in cultivation any other reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence had been excluded. It was necessary that the trial Judge direct the jury that the Crown had to negative the possibility that the equipment, lamp and jar were supplied to the cultivators in circumstances other than that directly involved in the cultivation. Comparison was drawn with R v Oliverio (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 August 1989, unreported). In circumstances where there was no direct evidence of the presence of the appellant at the site, it was submitted that it was imperative the jury be instructed they must exclude the hypothesis consistent with innocence, for example that some other person obtained a jar of peanut butter, lamp and pump in entirely unrelated circumstances for their own undisclosed reasons. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
     10 A direction on circumstantial evidence was required. In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 586 Dawson J, with whose judgment Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “….the only proper course for the jury to adopt was to consider all the evidence together. Nor was it necessary for the jury to reach any particular intermediate conclusion of fact in making an inference of guilt on the part of the applicant, other than the obvious one, tantamount to an inference of guilt, that the applicant was engaged in a combination of the kind alleged against him. Of course, the jury could not properly have made that inference unless they were satisfied that, upon the whole of the evidence in all three categories, there was no reasonable explanation consistent with the applicant’s innocence. It was appropriate that the jury should have been given a direction in those terms and they were given one.” 
         
        
       
     11 In summing up the learned trial Judge instructed the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Once you have decided what the facts are as you find them to be, you can then decide whether the accused is guilty or not guilty but, you must not find the accused guilty if on the facts as you find them to be, there is a reasonable explanation for those facts which is consistent with his innocence. I will go over that again because it is very important. You must not find the accused guilty, if you are looking at the circumstantial evidence, unless on all the facts as you find them to be, there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence. You have looked at the facts, you have decided what the facts are, if you think there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence, then you must not find him guilty, you must find him not guilty.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     12 Emphasis was placed upon the first sentence in the passage suggesting that the jury was required to engage in an examination of the evidence to establish whether a “reasonable explanation exists” and shifting the burden to the appellant to satisfy the jury that such a reasonable explanation did exist. The verdict of guilty could only be returned when the jury were satisfied that the circumstances were inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused; Peacock v R (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634. Later in the summing up the trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the circumstantial parts of the case, you must not find the accused guilty if there is another reasonable explanation for all the facts as you find them to be.” 
         
        
       
     13 It was submitted that the jury had not been disabused of the need to inquire whether the appellant had established the existence of a reasonable explanation. Later the trial Judge revisited the matter. It was submitted that the jury could only be left with the impression that it was for the appellant to establish the existence of such a reasonable explanation not for the Crown to negate it. 
      
       
     14 It was conceded that counsel at the trial, not Mr Corish, indicated that he had no complaint about the general direction in relation to circumstantial evidence. It was suggested that the subtle distinction between what was said and should have been said while important may have passed unnoticed. It was unlikely to be a consequence of any tactical decision by counsel for the appellant. 
      
       
     15 Mr Corish’s submissions did not address the core of ground 1, namely the asserted failure adequately to direct on the necessity for a finding of knowledge of actual cultivation and the absence of an alternative explanation. On these matters, in supplementary submissions, the Crown referred to various parts of the summing up where the trial Judge had stressed the elements of the offence as knowingly taking part in the cultivation (see pp 6, 7, 8 and 10 of the summing up). The learned trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “So the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that not only did Carl Rodney Slattery take part in the cultivation but that he did so with knowledge that the plants were cannabis plants and with an intention of taking part in their cultivation.” 
         
        
        
       At 60 of his summing up his Honour referred to what the appellant said. His Honour said: 
        
        
         
         “The accused’s case is a simple one. He simply says I did not know anything about this crop site. I never went there. I never knowingly gave any equipment, supplied any equipment or repaired anything to be used there. I did not provide any hurricane lamp or anything of that nature to be used there. It was a major crop plantation, yes. But it had nothing whatsoever to do with me and I was not knowingly in any way whatsoever. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said to you, the Crown bears the onus of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. In relation to the circumstantial parts of the case, you must not find the accused guilty if there is another reasonable explanation for all of the facts as you find them to be.” 
         
        
       
     16 The Crown submitted that an analysis of the summing up did not support the claim that the directions cast the onus on the appellant to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with his innocence. It seems to me a fine distinction to draw between not finding the accused guilty if there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence and not finding the accused guilty unless there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence. It was a distinction which apparently passed by counsel at the trial. In my opinion, there is nothing in the point and this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     17 The appellant was unrepresented on his appeal and argued the matter for himself. He relied upon three affidavits made by himself on 1, 14 and 15 February 2002, on two affidavits made by Silvia Mayorca on 9 February 2001 and 19 April 2001 and an affidavit of Mathew Wilfred Faith of 15 August 2001. The first of these affidavits, the appellant’s affidavit of 1 February, covers 77 pages and contains by inclusion, annexure or reference the bulk of the material upon which he relies. In the course of short oral submissions to the Court the appellant said that the appeal would stand or fall on the medical evidence.  
      
       
     18 At the beginning of the first affidavit the appellant set out his grounds as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Grave miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Fabrication of evidence by police and improper conduct. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Crown witness conducted a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Direction as to the prints found being circumstantial evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Defence impaired by profound lost memory. 
         
        
        
         
         6. Test carried out non-specific therefore non-expert no direction to probative value. 
         
        
        
         
         7. Crown witness Carol May Duggan’s evidence tainted. 
         
        
        
         
         8. Crown witness Carol May Duggan’s evidence not included in Crown brief. 
         
        
        
         
         9. All available evidence not before the jury.” 
         
        
       
     19 He next set out what he described as the questions involved in the Colo matter claiming amongst them that there was evidence of “amnesia” not available at the time of the trial and that his medical condition caused him not to be able to recall vital evidence which was supported by a wealth of corroborating evidence. He elaborated upon a claim that the witness Carol May Duggan conducted a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice with motives for revenge and financial gain. 
      
       
     20 The questions then extended out to allegations against the police officers involved. In particular, the appellant claimed, in reliance upon the evidence of Ms Mayorca and Mr Faith, that the area of cultivation was easily discoverable and not a remote and isolated area. This was evidence based on visits to the site made in 2000 and 2001. On its face it seems to be rather beside the point. There was no issue at the trial that the site was one on which in late 1993 and January 1994 a substantial crop of cannabis was being cultivated. There was no issue that on the site were found two articles, the peanut butter jar and the lamp, which bore the appellant’s thumbprint. There was evidence that the glove with a hole in the right thumb was found some years later which might be regarded as surprising. But there was also evidence upon which the jury could be satisfied that it had been there for some years before it was found. 
      
       
        
       Loss of memory 
        
       
     21 The main thrust of the appellant’s argument related to what he described as his “profound loss of memory” at the time of the trial which robbed him of the opportunity to defend himself properly (see para 8 of his first affidavit). Perhaps more significant is the claim that at the time the appellant made the admission to the witness Duggan, he was suffering from a form of “global amnesia”. This condition was said to result from a head injury he claimed was caused by a police assault in 1991 and to have been aggravated by his coming upon the blood soaked corpse of a cellmate while he was in gaol. According to the appellant the consequences relevant to this appeal were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “i) The profound memory loss caused me not to be able to recall that I had served near to 8 months on remand. This was not taken into account by either judges nor was it raised during the course of both sentences. 
         
        
        
         
         ii) Not to able to recall that I had already told Carol Duggan that I was arrested for cultivation and that a print of mine was found on a peanut butter jar. I gave instructions that she was to inform my legal representatives. 
         
        
        
         
         iii) Not to be able to recall that Carol Duggan was present at the Auburn Hospital in the company of my solicitors. 
         
        
        
         
         iv) Not able to recall that my wife Janet Slattery, was told on the 16 January 1994 before the alleged admission took place, by Carol Duggan that I was arrested for cultivation and that a print was found on a peanut butter jar. 
         
        
        
         
         v) Not able to recall that I was suffering from profound memory loss at the time of the alleged admissions. 
         
        
        
         
         vi) Not able to recall that I had met Detective Henry at our home some time in 1993 and that he was introduced to me as a friend of Carol Duggan’s who was married to one of her old girl friends.” 
         
        
       
     22 The appellant claimed that he was disadvantaged at the trial because the prison records did not show that he was admitted to Prince Henry Hospital from 14 January 1994 to 23 January 1994. At the trial the appellant gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Where were you in January 1994 after the day of your arrest? A. I was in the Prince Henry Hospital for 14 days. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when you say Prince Henry Hospital, what part of Prince Henry Hospital were you in? A. It’s the prison annex of Prince Henry Hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. After 14 days, where did you go then? A. I was transferred to the Remand Centre at Long Bay, the prison complex. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were you in custody as a result of having been refused bail? A. Yes, I was.” 
         
        
       
     23 Not long after that evidence was given the trial Judge granted the appellant leave to serve a subpoena on the proper officer of the Department of Corrective Services Sydney for the production of all records of outgoing telephone calls made by him whilst in custody at the Prince Henry annex of Long Bay Correctional Centre for the period 13 January 1994 to 10 February 1994. 
      
       
     24 It is not entirely clear from the material the appellant has submitted the period during which he was said to have suffered global amnesia, but it seems to have been during the twelve months after the alleged bashing in 1991. Doctor Swan, in her report of 17 January 1994, referred to amnesia as part of the history she was given by the appellant. She wrote: 
      
       
        
         
          “Mr Slattery gives a history of generalised amnesia for all the details of his life prior to his collapse ….. in police custody for charges of cultivation of marijuana. He states that he has no memory for personal identity and that he was unable to remember also his wife and son. The one detail he was able to remember is that he is a cigarette smoker. (The appellant) also states that he is ….. depressed.” 
         
        
       
     25 In the Prince Henry Hospital evening nursing report of 14 January 1994 appears: 
      
       
        
         
          “Admitted to Auburn Hospital following queried seizure whilst in police hospital. Patient suffering from memory loss and experiences bouts of dizziness accompanied by headaches and blackouts since December 1994 ……Patient unable to remember date or why he was admitted into hospital.” 
         
        
        
       The nursing notes for 15 January 1994 state: 
        
        
         
         “Patient states he does not know where he was before being admitted. Denies being in gaol.” 
         
        
        
       Notes of Dr Spira of that date state: 
        
        
         
         “Mr Slattery claims no memory of self or past beyond his time in Auburn Hospital yesterday. Nevertheless he has a clear recall of what has been said to him…… He seems surprised at being in gaol. …. Either a conversion reaction or malingering.” 
         
        
        
       On 18 January 1994 Dr Spira observed that the appellant had no memory and claimed not to have recognised his wife “but feels that he would do so now”. The doctor also notes some inconsistencies in history. Dr Swan, in the report from which I have already quoted, said that the features were consistent with psychogenic amnesia. 
        
       
     26 The appellant’s claims about problems with his memory which he says continued until about 1999 do not sit well with a reading of the transcript of his evidence at the trial which continued for some time. Both in chief and under cross-examination he appeared to answer questions positively and with ready recall. There is no sign that I have come upon which indicates a lapse of memory. I give a short and random example of his evidence in cross-examination relating to the occasion when he had been pulled over by police on 23 November 1993 at 5 am in the morning when driving a white Ford Falcon which appeared to be travelling in convoy with a red Toyota Hilux along the Singleton Road towards Wilberforce: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you deny knowledge of the other vehicle when police initially spoke to you? Answer, ‘Yes’. Was that answer of yours to the police, true? A. That I denied knowledge of the other vehicle?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That of course was a reference to the Hilux, the red Hilux in which your son Darren was driving? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, tell me: What was actually said by you to police about that matter? A. The officer said ‘who was driving the other vehicle.’ I said ‘I don’t know.’ That’s in fact what I said. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was the end of it? A. There could have been more words spoken. It has been a long time. It is 1994. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That of course was Constable Gorman? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The officer you were speaking to at the side of the road? A. I can’t agree or disagree with this. There is large portions been left out of the police statement in relation to what Mrs Duggan said to him. None of that is recorded here. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Does that relate to the questions I am asking you now? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let’s not get side tracked: When Constable Gorman asked you if you knew, had knowledge of the other vehicle, and you answered that you did not, I take it that that was a lie? A. Yes, that was a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To Constable Gorman at the side of the road on that day? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, did you also say to Constable Gorman that you were there that morning and you had come to pick up your girlfriend and that her car had broken down? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you said that, did you indicate the white car that was right next to all three of you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well now, were you worried about the fact that the police might associate you with your son Darren on that particular morning? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about the fact that the pump was in the back of the car? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about giving a true explanation to Constable Gorman as to why you were at Windsor on that particular morning? A. Could you repeat that question again? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about the reason that you were at Windsor on that particular morning? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see is this the case: That that very pump was destined for the cannabis plantation? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The very pump that you had in the boot of the car? A. No, it was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was this the case: That the very pump that you had in the back of the car, was the pump in the middle there, exhibit AD? A. No it was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it in fact the case that you had exhibit AD in the boot of the white car, on that particular morning and you had a guilty conscious about the fact? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I suggest that was the reason you lied to the police as you did? A. No that was not the reason. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, at the time that you were pulled over by the police did you know that Darren had the tiller on the back of the red Hilux? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time you were pulled over by the police, did you know that Darren had fittings, and I mean irrigation type fittings, in his car? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time you were pulled over by police was Darren wearing camouflaged clothing? A. I never seen him. He never got out of the vehicle for me to observe whether he was wearing camouflaged clothing or not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see him at all that day? A. Do you mean in the morning when we pulled up?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. No, at any time that day? A. I only seen him sitting in the truck, oh 20 feet away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see he was wearing camouflaged clothing? A. No, it was dark sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see your son later that day? A. No I did not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t go to help him with the strawberry patch later that day? A. No I did not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Have you ever seen Darren wearing camouflaged clothing? A. Yes I have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When? Tell me about it? A. Just around the farm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There was camouflaged clothing found by police when they searched Augusta Street? A. Yes that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was that Darren’s? A. No that was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You gave evidence, I just want to check whether this is just a slip of the tongue: I don’t mean anything sinister by that. I want to clear this up. Do you remember giving evidence that when shown the photograph with the camouflaged clothing found at Augusta Street, by the police, that you said ‘it is Luke Duggan’s for sure’? A. That is correct.” 
         
        
       
     27 In his affidavit the appellant emphasised that it was in early 1997 that Ms Duggan contacted the Department of Public Prosecutions and told an officer of that department that she had information that might assist the department in its case against the appellant. A meeting was set up between her solicitor, who was acting for her in civil proceedings which the appellant had begun against her on 20 December 1996 under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984. The police made available to the solicitor copies of photographs and the appellant’s statement. The resultant statement made by Ms Duggan on 24 July 1997 and police interview on 30 July 1997 referred in particular to a glove with a hole in it and the Tempest brand radio that she claimed belonged to her son Luke Montague.  
      
       
     28 The appellant claimed that Ms Duggan provided this false evidence in order to have the appellant convicted and so defeat the civil proceedings in reliance upon the Felon (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981. Contrast was given between her evidence at the trial and what she said in the civil proceedings. She conceded that she made the statements to the police three years after the appellant’s arrest “out of revenge”. The affidavit extended in various ways to undermine the credit and credibility of Ms Duggan. In the first affidavit the appellant claimed that the Senior Detective in charge of the matter, Detective Henry, was a personal friend of Ms Duggan.  
      
       
     29 The appellant’s counsel canvassed with Ms Duggan various aspects of his condition and custody during her cross-examination (T450.41, 452.25, 452.31, 452.48). At T454, Ms Duggan was cross-examined on an affidavit she swore in 1994 to be used in support of the appellant’s application that he was not fit to stand trial. At T815.5 and T816.04, the appellant gave evidence that he had not made the statements attributed to him by Ms Duggan. Ms Duggan gave evidence at T408-522 and the contentions now put forward by the appellant were discussed exhaustively.  
      
       
     30 During the summing up the trial Judge at pages 18.2-22.5 and 46 gave directions about the possible unreliability of Ms Duggan’s evidence and at 18, 19 and 46 isolated the reasons why she might be unreliable. No additional directions or re-directions were sought. The alleged conspiracy was sufficiently before the jury when they considered the evidence of Ms Duggan. The medical conditions that the appellant suffered were well documented and known both to the appellant and his counsel at the trial. The appellant’s court and custodial history was also known. The appellant, in giving evidence at the trial, chose not to claim that his memory was impaired and gave detailed evidence from memory of events and circumstances of his defence (see T787-793, 793-797, 797-805, 805-833). Apart from matters now raised in the affidavit of Ms Mayorca all other material was before the Court. As I have indicated, I do not think that Ms Mayorca’s evidence is of any weight in determining whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     31 Taking account of all the matters raised by way of grounds of appeal and in the affidavits and other documents to which the appellant has referred I am satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Sentence 
        
       
     32 In sentencing the appellant, Judge Knight took account of the whole of the period of two years seven months and twenty-five days that he had spent in custody being two years seven months and eight days between 13 January 1994 and 21 August 1996 and seventeen days between 6 October 1998 and 23 October 1998 when his Honour passed sentence. His Honour said that before taking into account the time in custody the appropriate sentence would have been a total sentence of seven years with a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. His Honour reduced both the total sentence and the minimum sentence by the two years seven months and twenty-five days. In his affidavit the appellant referred to what he described as a further eight months that was not taken into account and that was served on remand after his arrest on 25 March 1991 to release on bail on 7 November 1991. The period referred to followed the appellant’s arrest during a police raid on a cannabis plantation in Mount Kaputar National Park as a result of which he was charged with various drug and firearms offences. No explanation is given to support a claim that this period should have been taken into account in determining the sentence for a quite different offence for which he was arrested on 13 January 1994. At the time of this later arrest he was on bail for the Mount Kakputar matters. No other reason was suggested, let alone argued, for interfering with the sentence imposed and that part of the appellant’s appeal should also be dismissed.

      R v Jeffrey Paul NOONAN 
      
      
       
        
       FACTS 
        
        
       The appellant was found guilty by a jury of wounding with intent to rob: s 98 of the  
       Crimes Act  
       1900 (NSW). The Crown case was that the appellant and his accomplice, having forced their way into the victim’s house wounded the victim by hitting him with a replica shotgun and a hammer. The appellant said that the gun was not his and that he was at home with his de-facto on the night in question. He had not served any alibi notice on the Crown as required by s 48 of the  
       Criminal Procedure Act  
       1986 (NSW) prior to giving this evidence. 
        
        
       During his address the Crown prosecutor commented on the appellant’s failure to call his de-facto. Such a comment was expressly prohibited by s 20(3) of the  
       Evidence Act 
        1995 (NSW) which prevented prosecutors from commenting on the failure of certain family members to give evidence. The trial judge specifically addressed the Crown’s error in his directions to the jury. The first ground of appeal was that the comment by the Crown and the direction given by the trial judge constituted a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       The Crown prosecutor also commented during his address on the appellant’s failure to lodge an alibi notice. The second ground of appeal was that the Crown had failed to lead evidence from the appellant about the lodging of an alibi notice and that failure combined with the lack of a direction by the trial judge on the matter resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       HELD 
        
       Per Beazley JA (Bell J and Smart AJA agreeing) 
        
        
       (i) In respect of the first ground of appeal there was no error in the trial judge’s direction:  
       R v Gardner  
       [2001] NSWCCA 381. 
        
        
       (ii) In respect of the second ground of appeal the appellant had given evidence that amounted to an acknowledgment that no alibi notice had been given. There was no miscarriage of justice in the Crown’s comment not being subject to a direction by the trial judge. 
        
        
       (iii) Even if the errors did either individually or cumulatively amount to a miscarriage of justice, this was an appropriate case to invoke the proviso, on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred:

      REGINA v JEFFREY PAUL NOONAN 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BEAZLEY JA: On 21 June 2000 the appellant was found guilty by a jury of an offence under s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in that between 25 and 26 February 2000, being armed with offensive weapons namely a sawn-off replica shotgun and a hammer, he assaulted a Mr Francis O’Dwyer with intent to rob and immediately after that assault wounded Mr O’Dwyer. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  
      
       
     2 The appellant appeals against his conviction. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
     3 The Crown case was that on 25 February 2000 at around 11.45pm Mr O’Dwyer and his housekeeper Mrs Beryl Fay Grube heard a rattling at the front screen door of Mr O’Dwyer’s house. Mrs Grube went to the door. A female speaking in a muffled voice said, “its Cathy, its Cathy, I’ve got problems”. Mrs Grube, who has very poor eyesight, has a daughter named Cathy. The female had a scarf around her head and it was dark at the front door. She did not realise that the female was not her daughter until after she had let her in the house. The female was wearing a blue checked shirt.  
      
       
     4 Mr O’Dwyer also came to the front door. He saw a male on the porch holding a shotgun. Mr O’Dwyer and Mrs Grube were forced back into the house and Mr O’Dwyer was pushed onto the lounge. The male intruder demanded money. After initially denying that there was any money in the home, Mr O’Dwyer told him there was money in a tin. The male intruder threatened Mrs Grube that he would bash her if the money was not produced. Mr O’Dwyer then grabbed the barrel of the shotgun and a struggle ensued. The male intruder began to flail Mr O’Dwyer with his hand and called out to the female, “Michelle, come and hit him with the hammer”. Mr O’Dwyer sustained a number of injuries, including cuts to his face. He lost quite a lot of blood but does not remember being hit with the gun or the hammer. 
      
       
     5 Whilst the struggle was in progress, Mrs Grube sneaked out the back door to a neighbour’s house to raise the alarm and the police were called. The intruders had fled, however, before they arrived. 
      
       
     6 On 8 March 2000 Mr O’Dwyer identified the photograph of the male intruder from eighteen photographs shown to him by the police.  
      
       
     7 Mitchell Pomfret, a real estate sales agent, gave evidence that on 24 February 2000, he attended at premises leased to Lee Noonan for the purpose of making a sales appraisal. He spoke to someone who introduced himself as Jeff Daniels. Mr Pomfret attended at the property a second time later that day. On this occasion, he noticed a sawn-off shotgun on a chair in the dining room. He considered the gun had some unusual features and thought it might have been a home-made weapon. Mr Pomfret had been a fitter/armourer in the Army. He attended at Macquarie Fields Police Station on 15 June 2000 and identified the appellant from a series of computer generated photographs as the person he spoke to and who introduced himself as Jeff Daniels.  
      
       
     8 Mr Pomfret’s evidence was corroborated by two employees from the same real estate agency. These two employees also made a photograph identification of the appellant. 
      
       
     9 On 1 March 2000, the appellant had been travelling in Ms Noonan’s when it was stopped by the police in Campbelltown. The vehicle was towed back to the police station and searched. Various items of clothing were found in the search including three blue checked shirts and a hat of the same style as the hat worn by the male offender on the night of the offence. The appellant identified the blue checked shirts as his and said that Ms Noonan wore them from time to time. Also located was what appeared to be a sawn-off shotgun under the passenger side rear seat. There was a red stain on the handle of the shotgun.  
      
       
     10 Detective Browne arranged for the shot gun together with a sample of Mr O’Dwyer’s blood to be analysed. Virginia Friedman, forensic biologist, gave evidence that she conducted a series of nine DNA tests on the handle of the shotgun and on the sample of blood provided by the victim. She concluded that the DNA on the gun handle and the blood sample were the same.  
      
       
     11 The shotgun was examined by the ballistics section at the Sydney Police Centre. The ballistics section identified the gun as a prohibited weapon. Detective Browne agreed in cross-examination that the gun was a prohibited weapon because it was similar in appearance to a shotgun. It was not apparently a shotgun which fired bullets. It had cables coming out of a recess near the trigger guard and may have been a gun used in an amusement parlour. 
      
       
     12 There was a dispute as to whether the hat found in the car, which the appellant had identified as his hat, was the hat the male intruder was wearing at the time of the attack. In his original statement to the police, Mr O’Dwyer had identified the hat as green. The hat found in the car was blue on the outside but the underside of the brim and the inside of the hat were green. Mr O’Dwyer said that his view of the offender came mostly when he was lying on the lounge and the offender was leaning over him, so that he mainly saw the underside of the brim. 
      
       
     13 The appellant’s case was relatively simple. The gun was not his, it belonged to a friend. The friend had stolen the gun from El Caballo Blanco, which he described as “an amusement place … they do horse shows and they’ve got a zoo and stuff like that”. 
      
       
     14 He also said he was at home with his de facto Michelle Shillcott (also known as Lee Noonan) on the night in question. No alibi notice had been served. An accused is required to give notice of the particulars of an alibi prior to giving evidence: s 48 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The appellant accepted in cross-examination that he knew something about the requirement to give an alibi notice. 
      
       
     15 The appellant’s de facto sat in the courtroom throughout the trial. The trial judge commented on this to counsel at a time when the jury was absent. It is not apparent from the transcript of the proceedings generally whether the jury were aware of this. 
      
       
     16 The appellant readily agreed that the gun had been on the chair when Mr Pomfret visited the unit. However, he said he did not know the gun was in the car until it was found during the police search. He said other people had had access to the car during the time between his leaving the unit and the search being conducted. 
      
       
     17 The friend Mark was not called to give evidence. The appellant said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Last I tried to find him he was at his parents’. I went to his parents and they kicked him out and they didn’t know where he was.”  
         
        
       
     18 During the Crown prosecutor’s address to the jury, he commented upon the failure of the appellant to call his de facto wife, Michelle Shillcott. The Crown prosecutor also informed the jury that no alibi notice had been given.  
      
       
     19 These two matters are the issues raised on the appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground One 
        
       
     20 The appellant formulated his first ground of appeal as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The comment by the Crown Prosecutor regarding the failure to call the de facto wife of the appellant as a defence witness, combined with the directions given in the summing up about that comment, constituted a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
       
     21 A comment by a prosecutor as to a defence failure to call a spouse or de facto as a defence witness is expressly prohibited by s 20(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The judge or any party ( 
         other than the prosecutor 
         ) may comment on a failure to give evidence by a person who, at the time of the failure, was: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the defendant’s spouse or de facto spouse; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a parent or child of the defendant.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     22 The trial judge gave the following direction in relation to the prosecutor’s comment: 
      
       
        
         
         “In his closing address, the Crown Prosecutor said to you, and invited you to consider that we had not heard from Michelle Noonan. You will recall that I told you, you are to consider the case on the evidence presented to you and nothing more, and you must not speculate about what might or might not have been said if other questions had been asked or other witnesses called. Whatever the situation so far as Michelle Noonan is concerned, so far as her being charged in relation to this matter is, there is evidence here that you would be entitled to consider has the ability to implicate her in the offence committed, and it may well be that the existence of that evidence explains her not being called as a witness. You should not speculate as to why she was not called as a witness and you must not speculate as to what she might or might not have said if she was called as a witness.” 
         
        
       
     23 The appellant submitted that the Crown prosecutor’s comment was “flatly prohibited” by statute and that the trial judge’s direction in his summing up made the case worse because it highlighted the strength of the Crown case as against Michelle Noonan directly, and therefore, indirectly against the appellant. 
      
       
     24 The appellant submitted that the direction given by his Honour was similar to the direction given in R v Zreika [2001] NSWCCA 57. Zreika involved a Jones v Dunkel direction. The appellant had been charged with one count of deemed supply of a prohibited drug in that he had possession of a quantity of drug which was not less than the trafficable amount. The drug had been found in the appellant’s home unit. The appellant denied the charge and proffered a number of alternate explanations as to how the drugs could have been on the premises. One of these explanations was that his brother and nephew had access to the unit during a period when he was absent. In her summing up, the trial judge gave a Jones v Dunkel  direction in classic terms in respect of the failure to call the brother and nephew, noting that the jury was entitled to draw an inference that their evidence would not have assisted the appellant’s case.  
      
       
     25 On appeal, Sperling J (Spigelman CJ and Carruthers AJA agreeing), noted that whilst a Jones v Dunkel direction in a criminal trial had been held to be permissible: see R v Buckland (1977) 2 NSWLR 452, an important rider was put on the use of the direction by Street CJ in that case at 459:  
      
       
        
         
         “In criminal proceedings, however, the making of a comment or the indication of the available inference will be attended by a marked degree of caution, inasmuch as in many cases the absence of a witness either for the Crown or the accused might well be explicable upon grounds not readily capable of proof. If it is suspected that there may be some valid reason for a witness not being called, then, in a criminal trial in particular, a careful appraisal is requisite before commenting on the absence of that witness either in address or in summing up.” 
         
        
       
     26 Sperling J considered that in a case such as the one before the Court, if the direction was to be given, the jury would have to be warned that there may be an explanation for those persons not having been called in the appellant’s case that had not been disclosed because the accused had reasons for not disclosing it. His Honour later commented at para 22:  
      
       
        
         
         “It may be doubted that it will ever be appropriate, in a criminal trial, for a judge to give a  
         Jones v Dunkel 
          direction against an accused in relation to absent witnesses, where the witnesses are themselves open to suspicion on the Crown case or on the accused’s account of events. If it is to be done in such a case, the direction must be hedged in the appropriate information concerning self-incrimination privilege and appropriate instruction concerning the kind of further considerations which moderate the force of direction in such a case.” 
         
        
        
       Sperling J concluded that at a minimum, the absence of information and assistance to the jury along the lines he had mentioned, rather than the direction standing alone, as it had in the present case, was erroneous.  
        
       
     27 In R v Scott (2000) 112 A Crim R 543 an unqualified Jones v Dunkel direction had been given. Greg James J said:  
      
       
        
         
         “To suggest it was open to conclude that evidence of those persons would not have assisted the case of the appellant was such as to divert the jury. To suggest that they might consider that the appellant should have called those witnesses was entirely wrong. On the Crown case, the witnesses were criminally complicit with the appellant. On the defence case, they, if they were heroin suppliers, had manipulated and deceived the appellant. The Crown’s reluctance or inability to call them was not elucidated but the explanation for their absence in the Crown case may have been reasonable. It was not reasonable to suggest that in any way those witnesses should have been called in the appellant’s case. The prospect that the jury might, from their absence, think that their evidence might not have assisted the accused’s case was, at the least, seriously confusing if not inevitable.” 
         
        
       
     28 The Crown relied on R v Gardner [2001] NSWCCA 381 where the Crown prosecutor had also made a comment prohibited by s 20(3), as being more directly in point. In that case, reference was made in the Crown prosecutor’s address to the fact that the mother of the accused had not given evidence to support the accused’s alibi. In his summing up, the trial judge informed the jury that the Crown prosecutor was not entitled to make the comment in question because it contravened a provision of the Evidence Act and continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “However, I, as the presiding judge am entitled to refer to that matter and what I say to you about it is this, there may be many reasons why the mother was not called. An obvious one is that she may have no recollection of the events of the morning in question. Nevertheless, you should not speculate as to why she was not called.” 
         
        
       
     29 The Court of Criminal Appeal (Sheller JA, Sully and Hulme JJ agreeing) held there was no impropriety in the direction. 
      
       
     30 In this case, his Honour’s direction was similar to the direction in Gardner.  The jury were also reminded at the commencement of this direction that they were to act only on the evidence presented in the trial. That was an important and entirely appropriate direction. The jury were then directed that they were not to speculate as to why Ms Noonan was not called. Nor were they to speculate as to what she might have said. His Honour then offered a reason as why Ms Noonan may not have been called, namely that she might have been implicated in the offence. The appellant contended that this comment “highlighted the strength of the prosecution case as against [Ms Noonan] directly, and therefore, indirectly, the appellant”. 
      
       
     31 The direction given by his Honour in this case was not, of course, a Jones v Dunkel direction so that it did not contain the vice that such an unqualified direction bears. However, the Crown prosecutor’s comment did have a more injurious effect than the comment in Gardner in the sense that it related to a possible accomplice as well as to an alibi witness.  
      
       
     32 The trial judge was thus confronted with an error in the Crown prosecutor’s address that needed to be addressed. It was important that the jury be directed unequivocally that there may be good reason why Ms Noonan had not been called. The reason given by his Honour was the obvious one. The direction was reinforced by a direction that they were to act only on the evidence before them and were not to speculate either as to the reason why she had not been called or what evidence she might have given. Had his Honour not given some content to his direction it is possible the jury may not have understood why it would be wrong for them to speculate. By giving content to the direction and supported by the direction that they were only to act on the evidence given in the trial, I am of the opinion that the jury would have been left in no doubt as to their task. Thus, even though the connection between Ms Noonan with the possibility of direct implication in the offence could be said to be more direct than the reference in Gardner to the failure to call the mother as an alibi witness, I do not consider that his Honour’s direction was erroneous.  
      
       
        
       Ground Two 
        
       
     33 The second ground was framed in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         The comment by the Crown Prosecutor about the failure to lodge an alibi notice in the absence of evidence of that fact, combined with the lack of direction about that comment in the summing up, constituted a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        
       
     34 The appellant’s submission in relation to this is bound up in the ground itself. Two additional points were made. First, the Crown prosecutor was given an opportunity by the trial judge to seek leave to adduce evidence that no alibi notice had been given but did not take up that opportunity. Secondly, it was submitted that “it is important that addresses in jury trials be confined strictly to the evidence” and that such a comment constitutes a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     35 Although the Crown did not prove directly that no alibi notice had been given, the following exchange occurred during cross-examination.  
      
       
        
         
         “Q You say you were at home on [the] night of 25, 26 February? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Was – who were you with? 
         
        
        
         
         A I was with Lee Noonan, Michelle Shillcott. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q Well I’m saying that if you rely upon an alibi defence that you were somewhere else that there is provision for you to advise the authorities of that in advance? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah I did know something about that, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q I suggest the reason that you haven’t done that sir is because what you’re saying is not true, you weren’t at home on the night when this offence was committed? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes I was.” 
         
        
       
     36 In my opinion this evidence clearly amounted to an acknowledgment by the appellant that he had not given an alibi notice and that he knew there was some such requirement. It also appears that there was discussion between his Honour and counsel that no alibi notice was given, so that to that extent, the jury were not mislead. 
      
       
     37 In those circumstances, I consider that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice in the Crown’s comment not being subject to a direction by the trial judge. 
      
       
     38 It was further submitted that the cumulative effect of the two errors was such as to amount to a miscarriage of justice. I do not agree that that is the case, given that the second error was not, in the circumstances of the trial, particularly egregious.  
      
       
        
        
       Application of the Proviso 
        
       
     39 The Crown submitted that even if the admitted errors did, either individually or cumulatively, amount to a miscarriage of justice, this would be an appropriate case in which to invoke the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
      
       
     40 The principles which govern the application of the proviso are well settled. Essentially there are two considerations. First, the proviso will not be applied where the convicted person has “lost a real chance of acquittal”: R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376. In Wilde v R (1988) 164 CLR 365 Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, after referring to the authorities summarised the principle in these terms at 372: 
      
       
        
         
         “Unless it can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence were strictly followed: see  
         Mraz v The Queen  
         (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514. The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case.” 
         
        
       
     41 Secondly, the question whether a reasonable jury would inevitably have convicted does not arise where the error is so fundamental such that “the proceedings have so far miscarried as barely to be a trial at all”: Wilde at 372-373. See also R v Bozzola [2001] NSWCCA 8; Glennon v R (1994) 68 ALJR 209. 
      
       
     42 Glennon involved a misdirection in respect of an accused’s right to silence. Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ said at 710-712:  
      
       
        
         
         “In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial judge’s misdirection on the applicant’s right to silence was ‘so fundamental’ that the trial was ‘hardly a trial at all’. Although the right to silence is a fundamental right of any accused person, it cannot be said that  
         any 
          misdirection on that subject is a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in Wilde. In this case, the trial judge directed the jury that they were not to use the applicant’s exercise of his right to silence in a manner adverse to him. This direction was perfectly proper. However, the trial judge then qualified the direction by informing the jury that they might use the applicant’s silence to test the veracity of the applicant’s defence. This subsequent direction was clearly erroneous. However, in the context in which it appeared and at a trial in which there was other evidence on which the applicant could be convicted and in which there was no other misdirection by the trial judge, the trial judge’s misdirection was not a fundamental irregularity. We would reject the applicant’s submissions in so far as they are based on this approach to the proviso.” 
         
        
       
     43 Their Honours also pointed out that in Wilde: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the majority stressed that there is no mechanical formula or rigid test to be applied to determine whether an irregularity is of this nature; each case will depend on its own circumstances and, in determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error.” 
         
        
       
     44 In my opinion, the errors of which complaint is made were not so fundamental such as there was barely a trial at all. Nor do I consider that the appellant lost a real chance of acquittal. This was a very strong Crown case. Counsel for the appellant conceded as much. First, Mr O’Dwyer identified the appellant as his assailant from police photographs. His identification at that time was unhesitating and he did not resile in any way from it during his cross examination. In his cross examination he said that his assailant was about 6 feet tall and about 20 years of age. Mr Pomfret also described the appellant as being about 6 feet tall and no contrary evidence was given. However, it appears that the appellant was about 30 years of age at the time of the offence. Mr O’Dwyer was cross examined on this:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q … [D]o you think if somebody was 30 years of age he could be mistaken for 20 years of age. Do you think that 10 years makes a difference from your view of people? 
         
        
        
         
         A Under those circumstances I must have thought that, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q I’m sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         A Under those circumstances I estimated that he was around 20. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And under those circumstances if he was around 30 do you think you would have picked the difference? 
         
        
        
         
         A I don’t know, I don’t think so, I can’t say.” 
         
        
       
     45 Mr O’Dwyer was not cross examined about the age of the appellant as he appeared in the identification photograph. Mr O’Dwyer’s error was not therefore, of much significance in the overall scheme of his evidence. The identification evidence of Mr Pomfret and the other two real estate employees was not challenged by the defence.  
      
       
     46 Secondly, there was the evidence as to the hat. The appellant identified the hat found in the car as his. That hat was the same style as the hat worn by the assailant. Mr O’Dwyer had described the hat his assailant was wearing as green. His main view of the hat was when he was down on the lounge with the assailant leaning over him, so that his view was of the green underside of the brim. Accordingly, although the hat was partly blue, Mr O’Dwyer’s evidence that the assailant was wearing a green hat, did not, in the circumstances, diminish the cogency of his evidence overall.  
      
       
     47 Next, Mr O’Dwyer’s blood was found on the handle of the replica shotgun found in the car. The appellant was in the car when the gun was found. Mr O’Dwyer identified that shotgun as the one used by his assailant A similar gun was seen by Mr Pomfret when he visited the unit. There were no other males at the unit on either of the two occasions when Mr Pomfret visited, both visits being unscheduled. According to the appellant, this was a mere coincidence as others were coming and going during this period. 
      
       
     48 The appellant also gave evidence. His evidence is singularly unconvincing as the following reveals:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q You agree that there was no other male persons there at the house on 24 February? 
         
        
        
         
         A When Mr Pomfret came in? 
         
        
        
         
         Q Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         A No there was people there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Other people at the house were there? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah, when he came the first time it was just me and like Lee was hiding from them because she owed them rent and then when they left, we loaded the car again, and then a couple of the other blokes they left again, that’s when he left the gun, sitting there, on the seat. Yeah, people were coming and going, I’m sorry. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q You say that these other people, these other people that were at the house, were there at the time between when Mr Pomfret visited on the two occasions? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah Mark was there and Shane Spencer and the[n] when they left they came back with another two people. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q Do you know what sort of gun it is? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah it’s a – it’s got a light bulb in the end of them, like there was another four and they were along the –  
         like another two that were sawn off 
          … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q You saw the gun, you say Mark Curtis showed you the gun on that day Mr Pomfret turned up? 
         
        
        
         
         A … yeah when he turned up … 
         
        
        
         
         Q You went and put the gun somewhere? 
         
        
        
         
         A No he had four of them, I just said fine yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Where did you take the gun when Mr Pomfret saw it? 
         
        
        
         
         A Just out of the room and threw it down onto clothes, I just thought they were toys, that’s what I considered it to be. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q You seem to know a bit about the gun, considering you hadn’t had much to do with it? 
         
        
        
         
         A I knew he had them, I didn’t believe him, but now that obviously it was all true, so what he told me was true, yes.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     49 Accordingly, one is left with a strong Crown case which was not shaken in any relevant way in cross-examination and an unconvincing denial of evidence by the appellant. I consider that his conviction was inevitable and he did not lose a real chance of acquittal. 
      
       
     50 It follows from what I have said that if I am in error in relation to grounds one or two of the appeal, I would apply the proviso.  
      
       
     51 One final point should be made. Counsel for the defence at the trial did not take any objection in relation to either of the matters of which complaint is now made. In that circumstance leave to appeal is required: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. As the matter raised in the first ground of appeal is important I consider that leave to appeal should be granted. However, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, the orders I would propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
       (i) Leave to appeal granted; 
        
        
       (ii) Appeal dismissed. 
        
       
     52 BELL J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
      
       
     53 SMART AJA: I agree with Beazley JA.
